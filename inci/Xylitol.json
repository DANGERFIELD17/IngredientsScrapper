      "description": "Xylitol is also called birch sugar because it is mainly obtained from the bark of this tree. Nevertheless, one can find a little everywhere (ears of corn, bark of coconut and in some fruits ...). It is a sweetener whose sweetening power is equivalent to that of sugar (sucrose), but with 2 times less calories (2.4 kcal / g against 4.0 kcal / g for sugar). In cosmetics, it is used as humectant and in toothpastes one appreciates its sweet taste. The ingredient is not cariogenic (caries generator, as can sugar). Xylitol also has a very low glycemic index which makes it a major asset against hyperglycemia, for example. It is used in food under the name E967.\r\n\r\nStudies have also shown that used over a long period, it can have an anti caries incidence, increasing salivary flow and pH while reducing the number of cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathogens.",
