      "description": "Citrus bergamia,  the bergamot orange (pronounced ), is a fragrant  citrus fruit the size of an orange, with a yellow or green color similar to a lime, depending on ripeness.\nGenetic research into the ancestral origins of extant citrus cultivars found bergamot orange to be a probable hybrid of lemon and bitter orange. Extracts have been used to scent food, perfumes, and cosmetics. Use on the skin can increase photosensitivity, resulting in greater damage from sun exposure.",
