      "description": "Vitellaria paradoxa (formerly Butyrospermum parkii), commonly known as shea tree, shi tree (), or vitellaria, is a tree of the Sapotaceae family. It is the only species in genus Vitellaria, and is indigenous to Africa. The shea fruit consists of a thin, tart, nutritious pulp that surrounds a relatively large, oil-rich seed from which shea butter is extracted. It's a deciduous tree usually 7â€“15 m tall, but has reached 25 m and a trunk diameter of 2 m. [1]\nThe shea tree is a traditional African food plant. It has been claimed to have potential to improve nutrition, boost food supply in the \"annual hungry season\", foster rural development, and support sustainable landcare.",
