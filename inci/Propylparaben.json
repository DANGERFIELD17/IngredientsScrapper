      "description": "Propylparaben is a synthetic ingredient used as a preservative in cosmetics. It is also present in foodstuffs (E216) for the same purpose (jams, drinks, sauces, etc.).\n\nAlthough the European Scientific Committee states in its latest opinion of 2021: \"Available data on propylparaben provide indications of its potential endocrine effects. However, the current level of evidence is not sufficient to consider it as an endocrine disrupting substance, nor to establish a toxicological starting point based on its endocrine disrupting properties, usable in human health risk assessment\", we believe, insofar as it is possible not to use it and therefore to do otherwise, and applying the precautionary principle, that this ingredient should be avoided in cosmetic products. For these reasons, it is accompanied by a red flower on our application.",
