      "description": "Salicylic acid is naturally present in many fruits or certain plants such as willow bark. It is used in cosmetics as a preservative, hair conditioner or for its smoothing and regenerating effects. Salicylic acid is also often used as a keratolytic in anti-dandruff shampoos, particularly for the treatment of oily dandruff (steatoid pityriasis).\n\nIn an opinion published in September 2018, the European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) concludes that salicylic acid is not a problem if used under the regulatory conditions (see below), however it states that: 'This opinion does not apply to products that are administered orally such as toothpastes and mouthwashes. Products to be sprayed that could result in exposure of the consumer's lung by inhalation are also excluded\". Salicylic acid is allowed in Organic.\n\nSalicylic acid is classified CMR category 2: Suspected CMR effect, but insufficient information is available.\n\n* CMR means Carcinogenic, Mutagenic and Reprotoxic",
      "regulation": "The maximum permitted concentrations are as follows :\na) Rinse-off products for hair and facial hair: 3,0 %.\nb) Other products, with the exception of body lotions, eye shadows, mascaras, eye pencils, lipsticks and ball-point deodorants: 2,0 %.\nc) as a preservative: 0.5% (acid)\n\nDo not use in preparations intended for children under 3 years of age.\n\nDo not use in applications that may lead to exposure of the end-user's lungs by inhalation.\n\nDo not use in oral products.\n\nFor purposes other than inhibiting the growth of microorganisms in the product. This purpose should be reflected in the product presentation.\n\nMandatory information : \nNot for use in children under 3 years of age.",
