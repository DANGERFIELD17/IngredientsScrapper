      "description": "This substance is no longer authorized in cosmetics in Europe because it has been identified as a persistent organic pollutant (POP) or (very) persistent, (very) bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT/vPvB). Its use is prohibited by the Stockholm Convention on POPs or restricted by the REACH regulation.\n\n---------------------------\nCyclopentasiloxane is a volatile silicone also called Silicone D5. It does not accumulate on hair or skin and allows consumers to benefit from the advantage of this family without its disadvantages: soft, non-greasy feel and lubricating properties.\nNevertheless, it has been closely monitored for several years and its release into nature remains a concern. D5 is classified as vPvB (very persistent and very bioaccumulative). The risk to the environment arises from its presence in certain cosmetic products rinsed with water: from January 31, 2020, the maximum content of D5 will be set at 0.1% in cosmetic products rinsed with water, which in fact prohibits its use, since in such concentrations it will no longer be of any interest. It is prohibited in organic.",
      "regulation": "Must not be placed on the market in rinse-off cosmetic products in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.1% by weight of each substance, after January 31, 2020.\n\nMust not be placed on the market in any products in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.1% by weight of each substance, after June 6, 2027.",
