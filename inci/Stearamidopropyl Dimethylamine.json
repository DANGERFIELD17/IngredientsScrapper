      "description": "Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine is a cationic surfactant used as a substitute for silicones in hair care products. It combines quite easily with the hair (negatively charged) to form a smooth film, but while not occlusive as a silicone. It adheres to the fabric surface to reduce static electricity present. It is a hair conditioner that becomes quaternary ammonium in acidic medium. Given its unecological manufacturing process, the ingredient is not authorized in France but in Germany Yes (BDIH).\r\n\r\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) concluded in 2014 the safety of Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine.",
