üß™ INGREDIENT OVERVIEW
-----------------------
- INCI Name: ALCOHOL DENAT.
- CAS Number: 64-17-5
- Function(s): Antifoaming, Antimicrobial, Astringent, Masking, Solvent, Viscosity controlling
- Origin: Vegetal, Synthetic
- Description: Denatured alcohol is an alcohol rendered unfit for consumption in order to avoid excise duties (indirect tax levied for example on alcohol, tobacco, or petroleum products) so that it can not be used to create "drinkable alcohols".
In cosmetics, it provides a feeling of freshness (aftershave, deodorants or perfumes). It is also used in organic products with essential oils to avoid the use of a preservative and has interesting properties (astringent, solvent ...).

Since 1 August 2017, Europe has imposed a very precise denaturing procedure:
+ 3 liters of IPA (Isopropyl alcohol / CAS No. 67-63-0)
+ 3 liters MEK (methyl ethyl ketone (butanone) / CAS no 78-93-3)
+ 1 g of Denatium benzoate (Denatonium benzoate / CAS No. 3734-33-6) must be used per hectolitre of ethanol (pure alcohol).

Denat alcohol. is not recommended for very sensitive skin like baby's skin. It can be irritating and tend to dry out the skin.
