=====================================

🧪 INGREDIENT OVERVIEW
-----------------------
- INCI Name: DIMETHICONOL
- CAS Number: 31692-79-2 / 70131-67-8
- Function(s): Antifoaming, Emollient, Moisturising
- Origin: Synthetic
- Description: Dimethiconol is known to create a subtle shine, smooth and silky to the touch. It gives a "bounced" appearance to the skin temporarily, which allows it to fill imperfections and small wrinkles. Compared to other silicones, it is known to have a fluid texture and less oily, which facilitates its spread on the skin. Dimethiconol does not pose a health problem: the CIR has given it a score of 1 in 10 in terms of risk (1 representing the best of the ratings). Dimethethiconol is a large molecule that does not penetrate the skin, and is often used with Cyclopentasiloxane for better diffusion. Like all silicones, it is not very biodegradable. It is forbidden in organic.
