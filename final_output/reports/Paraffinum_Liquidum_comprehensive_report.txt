COMPREHENSIVE PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM REPORT
============================================

🧪 INGREDIENT OVERVIEW
-----------------------
- INCI Name: PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM
- CAS Number: 8012-95-1 / 8042-47-5
- Function(s): Antistatic, Emollient, Skin protecting, Solvent
- Origin: Synthetic, Mineral
- Description: Paraffin oil is used in cosmetics as a softening and film-forming agent: it is occlusive, and creates a film to protect the skin. Paraffin oil is a hydrocarbon derivative (petroleum, coal). It is found in many products such as moisturizers, lip balms or makeup.
Criticism focuses on its origin, its very low biodegradability (pollution following its release into the wild) and its high occlusive power. It should be preferred oils of vegetal origins more neutral.
