COMPREHENSIVE AQUA REPORT
=============================

🧪 INGREDIENT OVERVIEW
-----------------------
- INCI Name: AQUA
- CAS Number: 7732-18-5
- Function(s): Solvent
- Origin: Mineral
- Description: Water is the most used ingredient in cosmetics: 83% of products contain it (percentage established from 50,000 products from the Inci Beauty App). Since water is of mineral origin, it can never be certified organic. This is why organic labels, to certify products, authorize fairly low minimums of organic ingredients (10% for Ecocert) on the total of a formula, taking into account that the presence of non-organic water is essential and often the majority in many cases.

⚠️ SAFETY INFORMATION
----------------------
- Safety Score: 0
- Assessment: "No penalty" in all categories.
