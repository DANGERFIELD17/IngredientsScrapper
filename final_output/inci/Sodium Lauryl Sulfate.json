      "description": "Sodium Laureth Sulphate (SLES) is an anionic surfactant used in cosmetics for its detergent properties. It is therefore very present in shower gels and shampoos. It is produced from Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) by ethoxylation, a very polluting chemical transformation, which is why it is prohibited in organic products. Sodium Laureth Sulphate is reputed to be less irritating than Sodium Lauryl Sulphate although the latter is more natural and authorized in Organic, it is the chemical transformation that has softened it and increased its foaming power.\n\nThis ingredient is classified as ecotoxic according to REACH (Aquatic Chronic 3).",

      "description": "Sodium Lauryl sulfate is a surfactant widely used in cosmetics. It is produced mostly from palm oil. It has a very strong foaming and detergent power, but it is criticized for its very irritating and drying effect on the skin, so much so that it is found less and less often in shower gels and bath products. Manufacturers prefer to use the ethoxylated version (SLES = Sodium Laureth Sulfate) less abrasive or other softer surfactants. However, it remains very present in toothpastes for adults (57% contain it) and children (42%).\r\nSLS is also criticized for being a pollutant for the environment, animals, aquatic environments or even plants. Nevertheless, it is authorized in organic.\r\n\r\nIt is classified according to REACH: Ecotoxic (Aquatic Chronic 3).",
