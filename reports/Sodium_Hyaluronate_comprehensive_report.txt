COMPREHENSIVE SODIUM HYALURONATE REPORT
===========================================

🧪 INGREDIENT OVERVIEW
-----------------------
- INCI Name: SODIUM HYALURONATE
- CAS Number: 9067-32-7
- Function(s): Humectant, Skin conditioning
- Origin: Vegetal, Animal, Synthetic
- Description: Sodium hyaluronate is the salt of hyaluronic acid. This active ingredient is appreciated for its moisturizing and plumping effect on the skin. It is a natural component of the connective tissue. It easily penetrates the epidermis and is then able to fix a large amount of water, up to 20 times its weight. For this reason, it is found in many cosmetics such as anti-aging, moisturizing creams or even foundations ...

Discovered in the 1930s, hyaluronic acid is abundant in the dermis of young skin, but its quantity decreases with age: the skin appears more damaged, with wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid is a fairly large molecule that has difficulty penetrating the skin, and is much more effective injection. In a cosmetic, it is its salt that is used: sodium hyaluronate is a much smaller molecule, which penetrates more easily and can then move into the deep layers of the skin.

This salt is a powerful humectant that attracts and holds water to it, making it the moisturizer of choice for the skin: it helps keep it "wet". As it attracts and binds to the water, it causes a slight swelling which reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles, to give the skin a younger appearance.
It is authorized in Bio.
