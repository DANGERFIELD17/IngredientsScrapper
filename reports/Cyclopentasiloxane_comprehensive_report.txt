COMPREHENSIVE CYCLOPENTASILOXANE REPORT
===========================================

🧪 INGREDIENT OVERVIEW
-----------------------
- INCI Name: CYCLOPENTASILOXANE
- CAS Number: 541-02-6
- Function(s): Emollient, Hair conditioning, Skin conditioning, Solvent
- Origin: Synthetic
- Description: This substance is no longer authorized in cosmetics in Europe because it has been identified as a persistent organic pollutant (POP) or (very) persistent, (very) bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT/vPvB). Its use is prohibited by the Stockholm Convention on POPs or restricted by the REACH regulation.

---------------------------
Cyclopentasiloxane is a volatile silicone also called Silicone D5. It does not accumulate on hair or skin and allows consumers to benefit from the advantage of this family without its disadvantages: soft, non-greasy feel and lubricating properties.
Nevertheless, it has been closely monitored for several years and its release into nature remains a concern. D5 is classified as vPvB (very persistent and very bioaccumulative). The risk to the environment arises from its presence in certain cosmetic products rinsed with water: from January 31, 2020, the maximum content of D5 will be set at 0.1% in cosmetic products rinsed with water, which in fact prohibits its use, since in such concentrations it will no longer be of any interest. It is prohibited in organic.
