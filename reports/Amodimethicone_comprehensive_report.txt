COMPREHENSIVE AMODIMETHICONE REPORT
=======================================

🧪 INGREDIENT OVERVIEW
-----------------------
- INCI Name: AMODIMETHICONE
- CAS Number: 71750-80-6
- Function(s): Antistatic, Hair conditioning
- Origin: Synthetic
- Description: Amodimethicone is a silicone derivative of dimethicone, used mainly in shampoos and hair care for its electrostatic properties. It makes the hair soft, easy to comb and shiny. The advantage of this silicone compared to dimethicone is that, although it is difficult to remove with a shampoo, it prevents other polymers of the same type can "re-deposit" on itself, so the decriated accumulation with dimethicone, which makes hair heavy, no longer exists here.

Just like dimethicone, the molecule does not pose any particular problem on human health (directly in any case). However, it is not very biodegradable and its impact on the planet both from the point of view of its manufacture and its rejection in the wild is not negligible.
