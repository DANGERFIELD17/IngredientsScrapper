It's one of the only proven \"cures\" for hair loss, and it sucks to see so many people read a few negative anectodes that turn them off it for good. When in reality, the drug is very safe if used correctly.\n\nI understand that some people physically can't take it for deeper reasons. Anyways, good luck everyone.",

Immediately after taking my first dose I could start to feel my hairline have a tingle and the hair started to feel better over the next few days. But then the sexual side effects started taking place. But the weirder thing was that my vision started to feel as if it were blurred a bit. Hard to explain. But my night vision had declined a bit as well and made lights at night have halos around them with sensitivity as well. Not only that but I had a few webby eye floaters appear as well. Now mind you I only took Fin about 3 week's total about 5 years ago and my eyes are still that way. Extremely dry and slightly blurred. I'm not out to fear monger but it's what happened to me and honestly wouldn't recommend the drug to anyone because you just never know until you have the side effect.",

MOST of the doctors recommended, stating that they had many patients on it for years and a VERY small amount complained about sides. The literature also show it’s safe, with all controlled studies showing the sides at 1-6% (and that’s counting milder sides like watery semen an libido). And now to address your points:\n\n1. Fin actually increases testosterone.\n\n2. For most people who are already fully developed, fin won’t stop a beard from growing. I’m on fin and my beard is as Thick as ever.\n\n3. Having Gyno doesn’t mean you can’t take fin. There’s a high percentage of men who get gyno from puberty (including me). According to that Doctor on here (i forgot his name, it ends with “man”, men with preexistent Gyno don’t have higher risk of getting it from fin)\n\n4. I agree DHT is one of the most important hormones in a human man, but after development it’s kind trash (imo). Anyway the studies show that lowering it by 60% in most men is safe. \n\nLike you Said, check with a doctor (and if we’re being honest here, check several doctors, just so you can be sure) and hop on fin, trust me you’ll thank yourself for it.\n\nAnd if after checking with your doctors, getting the OK and buying the pills you’re still not sure I recommend doing two things:\n\na. Leave this subreddit, cause 99.9999% of  people here (including me) are not doctors and have no clue what they’re doing.\n\nb. Check “Kevin Mann” on youtube for his Finasteride videos, that guy played a bigger role in me getting on fin than almost all other things put together. \n\nAnyway, good luck.",

Normally, my hair grew about 0.2 inches per month, but with biotin (and no other changes), it grew 0.5 inches per month—more than double the rate. I tested this several times, and the results were consistent.\n\nIn my experience, biotin didn’t make my hair thicker, but it did make it healthier. My hair was shinier and grew longer.\n\nAnother thing that might help is using castor oil mixed with coconut oil. I would warm it in the microwave for about 10 seconds, apply it to my hair at night, and wash it out in the morning. This combo cured my dandruff for 3-5 days, stopped shedding when styling, washing, or brushing, and made my hair more hydrated.\n\nAt the end of the day, give it a try before dismissing it.

Just use Minoxidil and Finasteride.” While that’s true for hair loss treatments, biotin might help if you’re experiencing shedding or did a big chop.

        "body": "Hello! I’ll happily answer ur question since it happened to me. I did my first hair transplant in 2022. Literally had no clue about Fin back then, but i did use Min for 2 weeks back then but yeah i was too lazy to do it consistently to be honest. 12 months post HT and my hair looked amazing. Like truly a gift from God himself. Shortly after, like 13 months post HT i started to lose my hair again. very drastically i might add (went through a lot during that time which caused me to stress in a way ive never done before) but yeah i lost a lot of my hair again and i felt like i was back on square 1. Today marks 5 months since i did my SECOND hair transplant and this time i’m on Fin (also 5 months) and i’m on Minoxidl too for 1 month (my scalp became so dry and flaky from it so i stopped using it 5 days ago or so) But i’m gonna continue using it again until i find a way to get rid of that dryness for good. \n\nWhat i’m trying to say is, it’s not really worth spending all that money, traveling, going through that painful and awful procedure and be ugly for the next 8 months or so only for u to end up losing ur hair all over again. it’s just not worth it. Really. It drains u mentally and physically and it just sucks so much. But i did it all over again and i will never stop using Finasteride. I learned my lesson and i paid the price for it, but it wasnt because i didnt wanna take it i just didnt know there was a medication for it lmao. Minoxidil however; if i cant find a solution for my dry scalp i will have to stop using it eventually. Sorry if this was too long but i really wanted to give u an actual truthful answer if u go down the same path as i did. Not worth it. Take meds if you’re gonna do a Hair transplant.

    "body": "**The vast majority of hair loss treatments offered over the internet are ineffective**. Nothing more than commercial nonsense aimed solely at increasing the revenue of the company who's selling them.\n\nWith brand names like *Regenepure DR* and *Neofollics*, ordinary products are transformed into “the latest innovation”. Phrases such as *This shampoo contains a variety of proven active ingredients that may improve hair growth and inhibit hair loss* make it seem like the efficacy of this product is undisputed.\n\nThe reality, however, is that it’s not. The company knows this and are therefore using terms that suggest efficacy but don’t mean anything out in the real world.\n\nThe health claims thrown around here and there make it difficult to distinguish between sense and nonsense. In addition, they also get on our nerves.\n\n# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this guide is to provide an overview of all treatments that work and those that don’t. Readers may consider this guide to be **all-inclusive** and treatments not included in this guide to be **ineffective.**\n\nFor our analysis, we’ve collected and analyzed multiple scientific studies. A treatment assessed as ineffective is really ineffective. This also applies vice versa.\n\nTo keep the guide compact and readable, we’ve summarised the analysis for most treatments in couple of sentences. For a complete overview of the research results, you can refer to the attached articles and scientific references.\n\n# Index\n\n1. finasteride\n2. dutasteride\n3. minoxidil\n4. saw palmetto (Permixon®)\n5. caffeine shampoo (Alpecin®)\n6. ginseng\n7. gingko biloba\n8.

Links to Complete analysis\n19. Bibliography\n\n# Medical treatments\n\n**Finasteride**\n\nFinasteride, known under the brandname Propecia, is a medication used to treat hair loss. The primary function of finasteride is to prevent disease progression (stop of hair loss) by reducing the amount of DHT. A single dose of 1 mg/d provides a DHT reduction of approximately 70%.\n\nNumerous studies are done on finasteride, 16 of which are placebo-controlled. All of them (16) were in favour of finasteride and proofed it’s efficacy. Contrary to other medicines it appears that finasteride remains effective over time. In a 5-year study in Asian males finasteride halted hair loss progression in 98.4% of them during the whole study period. In two other long-term studies of 10 years, it halted hair loss progression in 86% and 99.1% of men.\n\nTo date, finasteride is the most researched and effacious hair loss treatment available.\n\n**Assessment**: highly effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dutasteride**\n\nDutasteride, known under the brandname Avodart, is a medication used to treat male hair loss. Its way of function is similair to that of finasteride - it reduces DHT by about 84% at a dose of 0.5 mg/d. Dutasteride is more effective than finasteride but also produces a slightly higher risk of getting side effects.\n\nContrary to finasteride, the amount of long-term studies on dutasteride are limited. Studies, consisting of 1 and 3 year seem to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety, but follow-up studies are needed.\n\nAn important thing to note is that dutasteride, despite its efficacy, has yet to be approved as a viable treatment for hair loss. It is unclear to us why that’s the case. A possible reason might be that companies, physicians and government agencies alike don’t see much incentive into approving dutasteride since finasteride already stops hair loss in the majority of cases.\n\n**Assessment**: highly effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minoxidil (topical)**\n\nMinoxidil, sold under the brand name Rogaine among others, is a non-prescription drug to treat hair loss in both males and females. Contrary to (topical) finasteride and dutasteride, minoxidil doens not affect DHT. Minoxidil works instead as a vasodilator - widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels, allowing more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to reach the follicles.\n\nIn males treated with minoxidil, increased hair growth and density is noted. This led many people to believe that minoxidil actively stops hair loss. Including dermatologists and physicians. It’s important to note however that it does not. At least, not in the long run.\n\nAccording to long term studies, minoxidil reaches peak efficacy at 12 months but loses efficacy thereafter. Noteably, a steady decrease in hair count is seen after 24 months. In other words: hair loss continues after 2 years, albeit at a slower rate.\n\nWe are therefore of the opinion that minoxidil should only be used for the treatment of thinning hair. In case one wishes to stop hair loss it should be used in conjunction with finasteride, although finasteride alone should work perfectly fine as well.\n\n**Assessment**: moderately effective. Minoxidil does stimulate hair growth, but loses efficacy over time after which hair loss continues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Herbal extracts and preparations\n\nIn the digital realms of the internet, you’ll find many anecdotal evidence of people claiming to have stopped their hair loss by the use of herbal extracts. Hard evidence, however, is lacking. Studies that researched the efficacy of herbal extracts as a means to treat hair loss are scarce and generally of low quality. Our findings are discussed below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Saw palmetto**\n\nSaw Palmetto, also known as Serenoa Repens, is often recommended as a \\_natural\\_ alternative to finasteride due to its ability to naturally reduce DHT.\n\nAdvocates of Saw Palmetto often cite reseach papers from the 90’s that supposedly proof its efficacy. Another study that is heavily popularised is a research paper published in 2005 in which the inhibitory effects of saw palmetto on DHT was compared with finasteride.\n\nThe results of these studies are often taken out of context and used in a way that bear no relation to what these papers proofed. Secondly, some of these studies are so bad that they didn’t deserve to be published in the first place.\n\nTo make it more concrete: saw palmetto does indeed inhibit DHT but it does so only minimally, with finasteride being AT LEAST 18.000 times more powerful. It’s important to note that the inhibitory effects of saw palmetto has only been proven in cell cultures.\n\nStudies that tried to proof its efficacy in living organisms failed. In one study, the authors noted that 0.1 mg finasteride proofed sufficient to inhibit DHT in rats while a dose of 560 mg saw palmetto failed to be effective. A ratio of at least 1:18.000 when compared to finasteride.\n\nA ratio that causes the theoretical efficacy of saw palmetto for inhibiting DHT to become practically irrelevant. Simply because it would mean that one would need to consume 20x 450 mg capsules a day to produce similar effects to that of 1 mg of finasteride.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n**warning:** The majority of studies that claim to have found a positive effect were sponsored by the company selling the product. Risk of fraudulent data is high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Caffeine shampoo (topical)**\n\nCaffeine shampoo, known under the brand name Alpecin, is probably the most well known cosmetic that is supposed to treat hair loss. The company behind Alpecin, Dr. Kurt Wolff GmbH have tried their best to create credibility for their product by publishing 12 studies on their website that proof its efficacy.\n\nBased on the popularity of their product it is clear that they succeeded. Unfortunately for those that use their product, however, these studies don’t proof \\*\\*\\*\\*. Namely because most of these studies were either carried out by their own employees or by researchers that were financially supported by the company behind Alpecin.\n\nIn some studies it appears that researchdata was witheld on purpose while in others very questionable measuring tactics were used. The way these papers are written and the way they conducted their research, make it appear as if studies have been fabricated solely for marketing purposes.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n**warning:** The majority of studies that claim to have found a positive effect were sponsored by the company selling the product. Risk of fraudulent data is extremely  high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ginseng**\n\nLimited number of studies exist. Most studies were done in laboratory settings that do not correspond to real-life conditions. \\_In vivo\\_ studies are scarce and have a high degree of subjectivity. Large placebo-controlled studies are lacking. Results are unreliable.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ginkgo biloba**\n\nA minimal number of studies exist. The relationship between Ginkgo Biloba and DHT has not been investigated. Ginkgo Biloba as a means to stop hair loss seems thus excluded.\n\nSome studies examined the effect of Ginko Biloba for promoting hair growth, but were of very low quality. Objective measuring instruments are lacking.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marine extract and silica component**\n\nMarine extract and silica is available under the brand name Viviscal®. A self-proclaimed hair loss supplement that supposedly \\_nourishes thinning hair and promotes existing hair growth from within\\_.\n\nA statement that is straight-up nonsense because it is based on studies that were either paid for by the manufacturer of carried out by its own employees. From the 12 studies that are published on their website, at least 7 were financially supported by the company that sells the product.\n\nIn 3 other studies that are supposed to be independent, research was led by the exact same “researcher”: A. Lassus. A reseacher that also performed a study on Vivida®. Another product, produced by the same company of Viviscal®.\n\nCoincidence? We don’t think so. In this case, it seems that scientific “evidence” is misused in order to develop credibility for a product. Study results are fabricated and then used as promotional material to generate sales.\n\nAs is also the case for the studies related to caffeine shampoo, it cannot be proven that fraud was deliberately committed. That researchers were bribed or that data was falsified. You, the reader, can be the judge of that.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective.\n\n**warning:** A majority of the studies that claim to have found a positive effect were sponsored by the company selling the extract. High risk of fraudulent data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Vitamins\n\n**Vitamin A**\n\nA limited number of studies are available. Relationship with DHT has not been investigated. Vitamin A as a means to stop hair loss is unlikely.\n\nThe efficacy of Vitamin A in promoting hair growth has not been proven. High doses of Vitamin A can cause hair loss and hair thinning. Vitamin A supplementation is not recommended.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vitamin B**\n\nThe vitamin B complex includes eight water-soluble vitamins-thiamine (B1), riboﬂavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), vitamin B6, biotin (B7), folate, and vitamin B12.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vitamin B7 - Biotin**\n\nDespite a clear lack of evidence, biotin has been touted a cure for hair loss for several years now. Through online shops such as Amazon, sugar-sprinkled gummy bears are sold under the controversial name \\_hair vitamin \\_and carry the promise of \\_longer, stronger and healthier hair\\_.\n\nStudies are limited. Biotin effectively treats hair loss **if** caused by an inherited enzyme deficiency in biotinidase or holocarboxylase synthetase. A rare genetic disorder that occurs in 1:60.000 humans, is diagnosed at birth and results in death if left untreated.\n\nIn people without this genetic defect, severe biotin deficiency is extremely rare. In fact, a severe biotin deficiency has never been reported in the healthy population. In them, supplementing with biotin will not do anything. It’s completely useless.\n\n**Assessment**: effective in people with an inherited enzyme deficiency in biotinidase or holocarboxylase synthetase. Not effective in everyone else (99% of people).\n\n**Warning:** supplementing biotin may cause false-low troponin levels, a biomarker for diagnosing heart attacks causing such diagnoses to be missed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vitamin C**\n\nThere is no data available on the efficacy of Vitamin C as a treatment for hair loss.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vitamin D**\n\nSome studies are available. Supplementation of vitamin D for the treatment of hair loss was found to be ineffective. Some studies have measured lower Vit D levels in patients with Alopecia Areata (AA).\n\nThe relationship is possible but uncertain. An abnormality in the Vitamin D receptor is speculated. Alopecia Areata is an autoimmune disease. The low vitamin D levels are probably a consequence and not a cause.\n\n**Assessment**: not certain yet (we will analyse Vitamin D during the month March. We will update this answer based on our findings)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vitamin E**\n\nA minimal number of studies are available. efficacy of Vitamin E for the treatment of Androgenetic Alopecia not investigated. The focus of the studies was on the treatment of Alopecia Areata (AA).\n\nHigher values of oxidative stress biomarkers and lower concentrations of antioxidants are measured in patients with AA. The possible role of Vitamin E in the treatment of AA is suspected because of its antioxidant properties.\n\nThere is no data available showing Vitamin E to be effective for genetic hair loss or Alopecia Areata.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Minerals\n\n**Zinc**\n\nOnly a handful of studies are available. Quality of the studies is low. Small control group, high risk of bias etc. Severe zinc deficiency can cause hair loss but is rare. The efficacy of zinc in a healthy population has not been proven. Data is lacking.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Iron**\n\nThe number of studies is limited. Iron supplementation in healthy populations not investigated. Iron supplementation in men with AGA had no effect. Iron supplementation in women yields contradictory results. Efficacy is unclear.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Surgery and laser therapy\n\n**Hair transplant**\n\nIn a hair transplant, hair follicles are taken from the donor area to create a new hairline. The hair follicles are DHT resistant and the new hairline permanent. The result depends on the expertise of the surgeon. Patient satisfaction is higher in FUE than FUT.\n\nFor treating hair loss however, a hair transplant is pretty much useless.\n\nIt is a repair technique, not a prevention technique. Treatment with finasteride is therefore still required to stop hair loss.\n\n**Assessment**: not effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Laser therapy**\n\nThe use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to treat hair loss has been gaining popularity in recent years. According to the manufacturer, LLLT treatment would *stop the progression of hair loss* and promote \\_*hair growth, resulting in thicker, stronger hair shafts and regrowing hair*.\n\nAs evidence for the claims, the manufacturer refers to studies from 2009, 2013 and 2014. Studies that were financially supported by the companies selling a LLLT device. Results are therefore unreliable. The efficacy of low-light laser therapy as a treatment for hair loss remains to be proven.\n\n**Assessment**: moderately effective. We believe there is some truth in the efficacy of Low Light Laser Therapy, but compelling evidence is lacking. Almost all published papers had ties with the industry.

        "body": "I liked the study. Fun to read. I have some comments though.\n\n1. The results of the DHT induced cultured cells are meaningful, but you cannot extrapolate the data to human conditions.\n2. In the mice model they used 0.01% finasteride vs 50% Saw Palmetto. **A ratio of 1:5000**. Note that **both substances were intragastrically administrated**. This is important\\*\\*.\\*\\*We know from laboratory studies (cell cultures) that Saw Palmetto reduces DHT to a similar extend to finasteride in a ratio of 1:5600 - i.e 1 mg finasteride = equal to 5600 mg saw palmetto.However **when tested in a rat-model and administrated orally this ratio doesn't apply**. In the rat-model, an oral dose of 0,1 mg finasteride proofed effective while 560 mg saw palmetto (1:5600 ratio) was not! Even at a dose of 1800 mg/day they found no effect. **A ratio of 1:18.000**.\n\nThis shows that **administration method** (oral, intragastric, intravenous) is extremely important. Administration route has a big impact on absorption, distribution and metabolism and thus the results.\n\nSo to be clear: when orally administrated, saw palmetto was **not** effective at a dose 18.000 times higher of finasteride. \n\n**Crux of the matter:** I understand that people prefer \"*natural\"* substances (saw palmetto) over medicinals (finasteride). However, we should not fool ourselves here. Hair loss is permanent. People don't have time to experiment with substance X for several years and then repair the damage with substance Y. \n\nAlso: **don't underestimate the probability of people lying for money**. Scientists and Physicians included. The company that started the whole \"saw palmetto charade\" was Pierre Fabre Laboratories - a pharmaceutical company.  They published two studies in 1984 and 1996, both conducted by their own researchers and in their own research facility, the *Centre de Recherches Pierre Fabre.* \n\nA laboratory study in which cell cultures were exposed to extremely high doses of saw palmetto, that potentially destroyed their cellular function. Rendering the study results pretty much useless.\n\nThey tried to register Saw Palmetto, under their brandname Permixon,  as a valid 5α-reductase inhibitor with the European Union but the EU rejected all their attempts do so due to a lack of evidence.",

I believe it to be more efficacious than minoxidil, but highly doubt it's on par with oral finasteride. \n\nMain concern: 2 studies measured the effect of topical finasteride on scalp DHT. They found a reduction of around 70%. However, in these studies topical finasteride was applied on a shaved head. A significant limitation.   \n\n\nApplying topical finasteride on a head full of hair will drastically limit  absorption. \n\nTopical finasteride can be applied on the balding area, but my main concern is that it will then only reduce scalp DHT locally and not for the complete scalp.   \n\n\nThe whole point of finasteride is to protect existing hair. It therefore must limit DHT exposure for all hair follicles, but if topical finasteride can only be applied on balding areas, it would defeat its purpose.   \n\n\nI plan to publish an article next week explaining these issues in more detail.",

        "body": "You don't need to take any supplements at all, actualy. Just make sure that you are incorporating enough of the essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients for hair growth on a daily basis- stuff like vitamin d3, iron, zinc, vitamin c, protein, folate, omega 3-fatty acids, biotin and other b vitamins, and many more! so go look them up. It's important to do this because if the body isn't fed enough of all these things it won't use them for hair, skin nails etc. but for all the vital organs.  \n\nOn the other end you must also take very good care of your mids and lengths. Best way to do this (minimalisticly) is to use a hair mask, made of plant powder (best ones for you would be cassia, amla and hibiscus) once a month or 2 months. All of these plants help strengthen and condition hair because when they are mixed with water their active components: peptides get activated. When applied to hair, these peptides fill in any holes/damage on the outer layer of hair, thus stregthening and conditioning it. Cassia has more of a stregthening effect, amla an overall conditioning and curl forming one and hibiscus conditions the hair and makes it less prone to breakage by hydtrating it and increasing elasticity. These effects are long lasting, this way you will have a good base for other products to add to it.\n\nAnother thing that helps a lot with length retention and conditioning is using a leave in conditioner after a wash-off hair mask/conditioner to seal in all the active ingredients the wash off product has put into your hair. And as a finishing touch you can put a few drops of hair oil on your palm and evenly disperse it on your ends. \n\nHope this helps :D",

From my understanding, biotin could work great on patients whom recently finished chemotherapy as they will be biotin deficient.

But girl, lemme tell you, my nails are stronger and more beautiful than they have ever been, my hair grew 8 inches in approximately 10 months which is insane, but I also feel like im going double time on shaving and plucking *everything*. Priorities i guess? However, it should not make anything coarser or thicker, just faster growing. \n\nAlso, just a professional tip, if you want you hair to grow and be super healthy you need to be getting regular trims absolutely no further than 3 months apart. Split ends start forming after 6-8 weeks and if you dont cut your hair for say, a year waiting for it to grow, the last 6 inches of it (or average growth per year) is going to be trashed. Good luck!",

Your hair does sounds magical, but id be willing to bet you have coarse/normal texture hair, virgin if not close to natural color and that you don't typically do any heat styling. You most likely have quite a bit of split ends that may not be visually noticeable and have yet to be affected by breakage. In other words you have healthy hair that takes longer to get trashed is my guess. Fine haired girls have to worry about breakage and split ends a lot more, and especially those that color/style their hair.",

Surfactants in products normally come in the form of a system of several of them and there's also the whole formula to consider, a shampoo containing SLS that includes high quantities of lipids can be much milder than your standard non-sulfates formula, so it comes down to each formula actually. For example, CAPB, sodium laureth sulfate and cocamide DEA is a pretty common blend and also sufficiently mild for most, that's why you can find it everywhere.\n\nFine hair has special needs since the goal is not weighing it down so evading ingredients that may do that is a good idea. Things get complicated is hair is fine and damaged, for example! This doesn't mean silicones or sulfates, in general, are bad. Depends on needs/product and how they fit.

This past year (most of 2018) I went through a large amount of depression, so that probably did not help, though I am thinking it is probably a male balding pattern situation/getting older mostly.\n\nI have always had very long hair, and was hoping to keep it for a long time.  I talked to my Mother last weekend and she mentioned and recommended three things to me:\n\nBiotin & Collagen, along with putting a little bit of peppermint oil in my hair.\n\nWill this encourage new growth and/or help keep my current hair?  Is this all really not worth it?\n\nThe product links (I hope those are okay) are what she recommended:\n\n[Sports Research Biotin](https://www.amazon.com/Potency-Supports-Verified-Certified-Veggie-Softgels/dp/B00T56FQAE/?th=1)\n\n[Sports Research Collagen Peptides](https://www.amazon.com/Collagen-Peptides-Grass-Fed-Certified-Friendly/dp/B00XQ2XGAA/)\n\nAs far as peppermint oil I haven't really got a clue what kind or even what amount I should use, as I don't think that was a thing she had tried herself but she mentioned it.\n\nThank you for all responses. I realize there may not be much that can be done but, I figure I'd give it a shot asking around Reddit before giving up on my hair or wasting a ton of money on products that may do nothing.\n\nEDIT: WOW lot's of feedback here to read through, thank you everyone.  Sounds like quite a mix of options, I'll be responding to each when I have the chance.  Sounds like overall I should probably just get to the doctors and maybe see a specialist of some sort to see what would be best.",

I had many of the symptoms of low zinc in addition to hair loss (my canker sores are basically cured!)\n\nwas also low in D3 so I added that. In addition to this, I suspect I was also deficient in biotin due to my egg allergy (a common source of biotin) and nut allergy. I’ve started taking all 3 and my shedding has decreased from 50-100 hairs per day to roughly 20-40 if that. I lose barely anything now even in the shower. Nothing on my pillow. \n\nBecause of this, my density will likely improve over time but i’m already noticing the hair follicles becoming stronger! If you pay close attention to the pictures you can see a subtle difference from my before and after pics. Many people told me I had no hairloss but just looking at my hair with a mirror I can tell it has improved A LOT. I suspect I had a degree of telogen effluvium as well as progressive weakening/miniaturization of the hair follicles. The telogen effluvium loss is obviously going to take some time to notice - but the existing hairs are definitely thickening up!\n\nIn addition to this, my hair is growing like a weed. My barber was shocked how quick it is growing, and it’s easily growing 3-4 times as fast a it was before .\n\nMy hairline was receding a bit on the temples, but there was always thin hair in those areas. The thin hairs seemed to thicken up upon supplementing and my hairline is going back to where it was when I was a teenager (I’m 21 now)\n\nIt has only been 5 weeks and i’m already noticing a pretty big difference. This means that I will likely continue to see improvements over the next year. I’m so excited to see what my true hair thickness is. \n\nI honestly never thought just using supplements would give me noticeable thickening, based on what everybody says on here. Many people here will tell me it’s the same or the only way is Finasteride but it is not. I did not have MPB and it does not run in my family. The men in my family have very thick juvenile hairlines - so it was odd i was thinning and receding. \n\nAnyways, please pay close attention to the pictures - i never had noticeable hairloss to begin with even with those deficiencies but i can tell it’s becoming a lot better already - and if you look closely you can tell!",

It takes taking it regularly for a long period of time and all that will happen is eventually your hair will grow faster, but you won't notice it. For example...lets say your hair naturally grows half an inch a year, and let's say you have taken biotin for about 8-10 months, the following year your hair will grow an inch versus the usual half of an inch. This is assuming you are asking about taking it orally in pill form. Don't give into the hype of hair products like shampoo and conditioner boasting biotin as an ingredient. Its a gimmick. Biotin needs to be ingested to work. If you crack open a pill or grind one up and throw it on your hair it won't do a thing. So the short answer, technically yes, it does work over time if taken in pill form. Will you actually notice a huge difference? Probably not.",

I can’t pinpoint a timeframe of when it started since shedding happens on average 3 months after the “shock to the system” event.\n\n\nI’ve been taking biotin since pre-keto for maybe 4 months-and have been on it a total of about 13 months.  I started on the 1000mcg each 2x daily and once my hair loss started I upped it to 5000mcg caps 2x daily and a “hair skin Nails” powder that includes another 3000mcg daily---so about 13,000mcg daily.   Biotin helps with hair growth but doesn’t do anything for the hair loss—in fact, it seems to speed up shedding once I upped the dosage as it prompted the start of the anagen phase.   To combat additional shocks to my system hair wise I increased daily calories by about 300, upped my protein tremendously and started other supplements—collagen, evening primrose oil and I resumed my zinc as well as iron supplements since I showed deficiency.  \n\n\nOnce I was proactive about it all my hair started coming back in finally.  For about 2-3 months it did nothing but fall out and stress me out.  Now it’s back to about an inch in length and it sticks out all over in super humidity or static-y situations—I can’t complain, I just want it to keep growing!   \n\n\nI tried everything topical and nothing worked except for 1 item I found at Sephora.  It’s called Phytocyane by Phyto.  It’s a scalp serum and it has helped me keep the new hair that’s coming in.  For a while it would stay clear in color, grow to a half inch long, then fall out or stop.  Now it’s all back to it’s brown colour and holding fast.\n\n\nTotally rambled on your biotin thread.

Ideally 90 min a day but no one can do that.\n\nDermaneedle once a week, or dermaroll 1.5milimeters needle, once a week.\n\nMinoxidil, 5%. every 12 hours. Do not minox the day you dermaroll. Ideally minox after you shower, when your pores are open.\n\nOral biotin is better than topic. Biotin also makes all your hair grow (and nails), not just the hair you want, if you know what I mean. There is a company that sells a multivitamin with not just biotin but also all the nutrients you hair consume, which are quite a few. google them, QG magazine made a blog post about these, I don't remember the name.\n\nWash your hair with cold/regular temperature water, not hot. Coconut oil in your scalp before going to sleep.\n\nLower your cortisol: Relax, sleep, take naps, meditate at least 10 min a day (google headspace), chew gum, become addict to chamomile and linden tea with no sugar (honey maybe), chill music all day. All those things lower cortisol. Cortisol causes hair loss.\n\nby the time you are 23-25 maybe think about finasteride.",

I've seen the study published in /hairloss\n\nthere was a study to test the effectiveness of massage for hair growth and they found out that doing 90min for a year made some great result and I mean great. but the minimum of 30min, 15 min morning, 15 min later, had slower but effective results (takes more than a year).\n\nthe massages is something you do not to cure but kinda as a habit, and slowly, in time, will help you.

It's a little expensive and you might be tempted to go to like a discount store and say oh they have it here well there's diversion that goes on and our industry for sad reasons but they take the products and either alter them or they change the dates or you can't be sure what you're getting is correct unless you get it from a professional hairstyles I mean you can go into a I mean you go into a like a salon and if you're not comfortable talking about it yourself talk like it's for your grandfather but explain like your s*** how you're sending out I mean I don't see it too bad I mean. do you color ur your hair? And yes you should see a dermatologist or a regular doctor's not even going to look at it they're just going to send you right to a specialist so that would skip that stuff and go right just to dermatologist. After all they're only cosmetologists that want to a crap load of school and can't cut hair. If you going to the right place I suggest a salon over a beauty supply and find somebody that has you know is experienced in make sure they sound at least likely know what they're talking about and you should already have looked up with nioxin is what the different numbers mean there's a one two and a three ones for colored hair and then the two other ones go course and I think fine but I've seen good results with it but like I said it's you're looking at probably 50 bucks for the kit to start with and probably another 2 months or maybe three you can you have to do it again and cut your hair shorter and save on product which would be my suggestion as well.\n\nPs- regarding biotin. You can find them at the dollar Express and you'll get a month supply in one bottle so just grab like five bottles and you're good for 5 months don't stop taking it though because what you see as not working, could be the only reason you have the hair that you have left.

But it's unlikely to be deficient in biotin unless you have a metabolic disorder.\n\nIt's like any vitamin: you need a certain amount to build and maintain a human body, but having above that amount won't make you a super human. Taking biotin might make low quality hair become normal, but it won't make normal hair become better than normal.\n\nUnless you've actually been tested and found your biotin levels to be low, you would be better off just eating a healthy balanced diet.

You also NEED to discuss supplements with your doctor prior to taking them, this will also help remind doctors that supplements are important.  A lack of biotin can happen as a result of medications or age, illness, or sometimes just because.  If my freaking doctors had told me that long term seizure meds caused a lack of biotin I wouldn't have had to have toenail surgery (toenails curl under when you have a lack of biotin).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI liked the halo beauty vitamins, trying another one for 3 months and am not as thrilled.  My 85 year old grandmother is doing the same, although I have a LOT of hair (even with seizure meds) and this is a hair question I can confidently answer because we measured hair line and thickness.  Yes, that one works.  No, I didn't get it soon enough to prevent toenail surgery that I'm still salty about.",

I apply Minoxidil twice a day.\n\nI think my hair responds well! It's just been a month but my hair growth is noticeable. I also have dread shed but to be honest I'm kinda excited about the dread shed. It's just somehow so satisfying seeing so much hair falls out and yet so many new ones grow. The funny thing is I have some hair growth on the forehead too now because the liquid sometimes trickles down my forehead.\n\nThe only thing that's not quite fun on Minoxidil is dandruff, sometimes my scalp is a bit dry and itchy. I use Briogeo scrub shampoo to get rid of the dandruff and it works though not fully. But all in all I think I'm heading in the right direction!\n\nI hope this brings hope to anyone else still struggling ❤️",

Make sure you drink a lot of water while taking it. \n\nI took 5,000mg of biotin a day and saw results within a month. My hair grows really fast already but I had over bleached it and was trying to grow out the damage as fast as possible. I stopped taking it once my hair reached the small of my back. Also, if you do shave your legs, you'll have to do so more often. Biotin is great for hair growth anywhere. \n\nYou can also add folic acid supplements as well. They're great for your hair and nails too and don't require as high a dosage as biotin. \n\nMy nails grew super fast and were strong as hell. My boyfriend used the word talons a few times. I could have probably snatched a salmon from a creek if I so desired. \n\nI don't use any kind of shampoo on my hair, so I can't help you on this one. But I understand sulfate free stuff is great if you're looking to grow your hair out. \n\nI hope I answered some of your questions!",

Now, over the years, my hair is only half as thick. Being a dietitian, I've been skeptical about using biotin as a hair growth agent, because there is no scientific evidence to support it. I've actually only found research refuting it.\n\nHowever! It occurred to me that biotin has variable bioavailablity (the amount that your body can make use of), so in a desperate moment, I bought a biotin supplement.  The Adequate Intake for biotin for women is 30 mcg. It is very difficult to find a supplement that is 30 mcg; Most of them are 500-1000% or more than you need. Biotin is water soluble, so you are peeing out most of that.\n\nI found a biotin supplement that is 200% of the AI, and I cut them in half and take one a few days out of the week. My assumption is that the mild supplementation will help me to meet my biotin requirements in addition to my diet.\n\nI have not noticed any incredible difference, although my nails seem slightly stronger, and my hair does not appear to be thinning at the rate is was before. I noticed a difference within 2 weeks of supplementing.\n\nThere is evidence to support that increased circulation to the scalp will improve hair growth and hair retention. Topical treatments from capsicum to peppermint have been shown to increase circulation, as has scalp massage. I purchased a scalp massager (those little claw looking things) and have been using that periodically. I'm not sure if it's making a difference but it feels great!\n\nGood luck!",

I take two a day, it says to take three but your body can only absorb a small amount as it is so I just take one in the morning and one when I get home from work, or around 8 hours later. \n\nAt first I think they made my breath stink, but it could have been something else, who knows. \n\nI measured my hair in march, from my roots of my natural color down to the dyed color I've been growing out- last color was March 2013. It had grown about nine inches in every spot I measured, average is said to be .5 inch a month or 6 inches a year, so I think it did help. \n\nMy eyebrows and other body hair also grow quicker too, though.  My nails were never long or strong and never really have been but now that I have acrylics on top I can see that they do grow quickly. \n\nNot sure what to say about skin, I have a pretty decent skin care routine as it is and the only thing that I can for sure blame pimples on is hormones, so whether the vitamins help or hurt... I didn't see a difference either way. \n\nI picked these vitamins because there are coupons in the mail for a few dollars off every few weeks, and they also go on sale buy one get one free often, so with good timing I got a years supply (4 bottles) for about 6 dollars each instead of their usual $12-16.",

They tend to treat things with diet, and supplements before suggesting pharmaceutical options. \n\n(Before ya'll call me crazy or whatever: I'm not saying they're better than medical doctors and I definitely don't believe in homeopathy just my own anecdote that I had success with a naturopath for some skin issues where my GP failed)",

I have looked up the limits and biotin is water soluble, so any dietary biotin could be consumed in higher amounts safely, but supplementing high doses will need to be discussed with a doctor, since each case is unique.

I suspect it may be stress related, and have looked into meditation and yoga for it, but haven’t actually started any protocol.",

Now it is possible to obtain all the essential amino acids with a vegetarian diet. But it is difficult. It's much easier to get all of the required amino acids via skeletal meat from animals.\n\nHere are the amino acids and their category.\n\nEssential:  phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, histidine\n\nConditionally Essential: arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline, tyrosine\n\nNon-essential: alanine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, serine, selenocysteine\n\nUnused: pyrrolysine\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow animal protein is complete in that it has all of the essential amino acids you need. Doesn't matter if it's pork, beef, lamb, chicken, fish, etc. Now let's take a look at vegetables.\n\nAlmonds: Low in lysine, methionine, and cysteine.\n\nLegumes: Low in  methionine.\n\nGrains: Low in lysine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell, what you want in your diet is all of the 9 essential amino acids, as much as possible of the 6 conditionally essential amino acids and as little excess nutrition (to limit weight gain) commensurate with the protein you require. Basically, consider everything you eat to fall into two broad categories. Constructive nutrients and non-constructive nutrients. The constructive nutrients are those that the body uses to repair and build tissue, such as protein, vitamins, minerals, etc., while the non-constructive nutrients are those that the body uses to produce energy to allow it to function. Yes, some nutrients can fall into both categories such as protein that can be used both to build tissue and be burned to generate energy. But that is just an example of the marvelous flexibility of biology. Given that you've recently stopped using animal protein and switched to mostly plant based sources, and following that your hair thinned out. It's pretty good evidence that you are deficient in one or more essential amino acids and only paying attention to eating foods \"because they're high in protein\" won't necessarily help if the high protein foods you select are still deficient in the amino acids you need.",

The protein in meat is highly digestible and balanced so you don't need to pay attention to get what you need. For plants, the protein isn't as easily digestible so you need to eat more. Additionally, it's not balanced so you need to eat a variety. For instance eating both beans and rice will give you a balanced protein whereas eating either alone won't. But the biggest problem in my opinion with plant based protein is the relatively low amount in most sources. This means you need to eat more. Which in turn means that you get more carbohydrates. That's not a problem if you have an active lifestyle and burn off those excess calories. But if you don't burn them off, then the body converts them to fat. The issue is that the human body has a \"feast/famine\" metabolism. It EXPECTS there to be times of plenty, and times of shortages. So during times of plenty, it will eagerly produce fat stores so that it will survive lean times. And it's quite miserly in burning fat stores, doing such things like lowering its metabolism to reduce energy needs during lean times. This is a major reason weight loss diets have such spotty effectiveness. The body simply treats them like a famine.",

Plus, the 'hair loss' thing is another thing that us 45+ ladies have to deal with.\n\nPersonally, I have used different hair loss treatments from the Loreal Professional range and they have helped with my hair loss and hair thinning. Taking some supplements is also good. The one that I really liked from the Loreal Professional is the 'Serioxyl' hair serum. I will attach a youtube video I did on this product in my channel, then you can see the actual product and get more info from there than me rambling on for a few more paragraphs.

She checked my scalp and follicles for any damage/signs of inflamation etc., and ordered bloodwork to check my hormone levels. She told me to use 5% Minoxidil liquid only in the area of loss at night until we figured out  the cause of the hair loss.  Costco has the best deal- something like 6 bottles for $20 something online. \n\nShe also told me that hair loss can be a delayed (sometimes up to a year) reaction to stress or illness. It turns out my hair loss was a combination of stress and a rare side effect to a migraine medication Topamax. Once I stopped the Topamax my hair stopped thinning. I would suggest seeing your dermatologist and checking any medications you are on for hair loss as a side effect even if it's listed as rare. Also worth noting a classic symptom of thyroid issues is hair loss. \n\nBonus: now the hair loss isn't a problem I use the minoidil on a spoolie for thicker eyebrows.",

There is, in fact, no scientific evidence that biotin is useful outside conditions caused by its deficiency. \n\nIn addition, as highlighted by recent FDA warnings, lab tests utilizing the biotin–streptavidin reaction as part of the testing procedure demonstrate significant interference in patients taking biotin supplementation. \n\nBoth false-positive and false-negative findings can occur with thyroid tests, human chorionic gonadotropin, cancer biomarkers, and many other tests, perhaps most significantly, with troponin, which can lead to a false-negative test in patients with myocardial infarction. \n\nLet us use biotin when its truly indicated, probably 1% of times it is currently prescribed. \n\nIn addition, when prescribed, warn patients to alert their physicians if lab tests are ordered. By the way, chicken soup contains a lot of sodium! \n\n[Link to Article](http://prac.co/l/2krua64y)",

If CBC is normal , then you have aga.\n\nYou need to start on spirolactone and oral minoxidil(since you not responding to topical , start oral at 1mg a day and increase with help of doc or even by ur self max you can go is 2.5mg which is highest for women). \n\nTake a multi vitamin and also eat 4 eggs a day which provide 100 percent daily value of mostly all amino acid .\n\nFor shampoo use ketoconazole 2percent , 1percent is not effective(it's proven to stimulate hair growth , if you have dry scalp use rosemerry oil for oiling check YouTube for how to use it)\nAll ingredient I'm mentioning are clinically backed up by studies.\n\nThis will save you i for sure. Try this for 6months. You can do htrsnsplant if you don't see any results.\nI hope i become a derm and help lot of people like you .\n\nTake care",

Treatment options are needed for patients that do not adequately respond to first line treatments of finasteride or minoxidil. Topical ketoconazole has been proposed as a promising treatment. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of topical ketoconazole in the treatment of AGA. A systematic literature search was conducted within the MEDLINE database using the key terms \"ketoconazole\" and \"alopecia.\" Forty-seven papers were screened for inclusion, of which nine were assessed for eligibility. Seven articles were included in the qualitative synthesis, including two animal studies (total of 40 participants) and five human studies (total of 318 participants). Murine studies demonstrated a significant increase in mean ratio of hair regrowth to denuded area in the ketoconazole treatment groups compared to controls. Human studies reported increased hair shaft diameter following ketoconazole use. One study reported a significant increase in pilary index (percent anagen phase × diameter) following treatment. Studies also demonstrated clinical improvement of AGA based on photographic assessment and subjective evaluation. Topical ketoconazole is a promising adjunctive or alternative therapy in the treatment of AGA. Randomized controlled trials are needed.",

Of course my first instinct would be to pick up a daily multivitamin and a biotin supplement, but personal internet research has led me to believe that cystic acne is a common side effect of taking biotin supplements.\n\nI've found a bit of evidence suggesting that biotin competes with Vitamin B5, which is what brings on the cysts. People also seem to consistently suggest increasing water intake in order to combat cystic acne as a side effect of biotin supplements, but I'm coming up with very little sound scientific evidence for any of this. If any of you have experience in this area, I'd be happy to hear from you! I consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to skincare, but I'm kind of at a loss here, and I *really* don't want to end up with cysts! Thanks for any input!",

    "body": "Hey, just made this throwaway because a month ago I was desperately searching under this same topic and came up with nothing, and thought I'd share my little journey in case it helps someone else out there.\n\nShort story: Biotin supplements and shampoo have reversed my hair loss, because apparently I had WAY too little Biotin in my life. It is water soluble so it doesn't stick around for long. \n\nLong story: I've been vegan for 15+ years. I've also always had lots of hair come out in the shower for .. a very long time. About 9 months ago, I noticed that my hair loss was increasing and that I was noticeably losing hair at my temples. At the time, I frantically searched google using search terms related to female hair loss. Came up with nothing, mostly forums of distraught middle aged women complaining about how their doctors were useless.\n\nAbout a month ago, after large clumps were falling out every shower and my hairline having moved back about 1\", I really intensely searched trying to figure out wtf was going on. The Rogaine website was actually the tipoff.. they had a bunch of really manipulative advertising about how the vast majority of hair loss was genetic, not due to lifestyle (and therefore obviously you are doomed and should use their product until you die). I knew that hair loss was NOT a thing in my family, which made me consider lifestyle. Maybe, somewhere along the way, I had messed up on getting all my nutrients? 15 years is definitely long enough to see weird and significant problems develop if I had missed something.  \n\nI found one small study that said vegans were fine with their biotin intake. I found government agencies saying that there wasn't enough evidence to show that biotin did anything. Amazon reviews, however, were numerous and clear - it does a LOT of something for some people - and fast. Facing a future of baldness, I ordered biotin supplements and shampoo. \n\nWithin 24 hours of using them both, no more clumps of hair lost in the shower! Within a week, I saw tiny little hairs where I've been bald. Now about 4 weeks in, there's definitely lots of fine, fine hairs returning. I have fine hair, so this is not surprising, but of course now I'm wondering if there's some other nutrients I've just, missed out on and weren't covered by my multivitamins. It seems like I've always had brittle nails and easily get skin rashes... but maybe those were just from biotin deficiency too.\n\nHere's what the wikipedia on biotin says about food sources:\n\nBiotin is stable at room temperature and is not destroyed by cooking. Sources with appreciable content are:[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin#cite_note-ods-2)[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin#cite_note-lpi-3)\n\n* Beef or pork liver, cooked: up to 35 μg per 3 ounce serving\n* Egg, cooked: up to 25 μg per large egg\n* Yeast, baker's, dried: up to 14 μg per 7 gram packet\n* Whole wheat bread: up to 6 μg per slice\n* Avocado: up to 6 μg per avocado\n* Salmon, cooked: up to 5 μg per 3 ounce serving\n* Cauliflower, raw: up to 4 μg per cup\n* Cheese, cheddar: up to 2 μg per ounce\n\nThe US Institute of Medicine recommends 30mcg of biotin for females that are 19 years old and older. The European Food Safety Authority recommends 40 μg per day for anyone over the age of 18. \n\nBiotin wiki - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin)\n\nFor omnis, this really isn't an issue at all. This in a rare condition that is, fortunately, very easily solved. \n\nHope this helps save someone some grief. ",

About 1 week ago I noticed my hair getting dirty faster than it normally would.  \n\nI have curly hair, 2B/C that I can normally go 4-6 days without washing and it is not greasy/dirty feeling until day 6.  My normal routine for the week after my wash is to shower at night, using Ouidad Curl Quencher shampoo and conditioner, then once its wet I use the plop method until it is not dripping wet and add some argan oil and some curl gel or pomade (weather dependant) then let it air dry.  On day 2,3,or 4 I would straighten it and curl it if I was going out at night, and then wash it again on days 4,5, or 6. \n\nNow it is getting greasy with more dandruff by day 3 or 4, *which I know is a first world problem as my friend frequently points out hers will get greasy by the end of day 1 and I shouldn't really complain, but I am used to my 2 hair washes a week and I don't know how I would even schedule 4 hair washes (my hair takes hours to dry and I try to avoid touching it)*   \n\n\n\nDo you think that the biotin is causing this or maybe I have just been sweating a lot for some obscure reason? Should I decrease the mcg of the biotin I am taking?",

    "body": "Hi there!  I hope you're well.  \n\nI (21F) am looking for alternatives to Biotin supplements, or for other \"natural\" ways to strengthen my hair and nails.  \n\nMy nails are extremely brittle and flakey, and they peel very easily.  On occasion this actually becomes very painful when they peel or even crack down to the nail bed, and that can take so long to heal because my nails grow very slowly.  I don't necessarily need them to grow faster/longer, but I am very concerned with their strength and brittleness.    \n\nAs well, I used to have VERY thick and fast-growing hair, but over the past few years my hair has thinned considerably.  This could be due to age/hormones, but I am also on medication that could \\*possibly\\* be linked to hair loss (not a lot of research has been done, from what I can tell, and being off these meds/changing them is not an option for me at this time).  In addition to becoming thinner, my hair has also become very...weak? It feels like it is barely attached to my head, the lightest touch makes it fall, and it is very brittle.  \n\nThe reason why I am hesitant to try Biotin supplements is because I did try them at one time (granted, it was 4 years ago and before I was on meds) and within 1 week of taking it daily, it gave me HORRIBLE cystic acne on my face, back, upper arms, and chest.  It was horribly painful and the cysts on my back would even burst if I moved too much in my sleep, scrubbed too hard in the shower, etc., so I am very hesitant to go down that road again.  That said, it did make my nails INCREDIBLY strong, and my hair grew like weeds (although I had very thick hair at the time so I don't recall if it improved thickness).  I do believe that Biotin was the cause of this reaction because it began within 1 week of taking it daily, and I stopped getting new cysts after a week of stopping the Biotin (though the existing cysts took weeks to heal).  When I started taking it, I purposefully kept my entire product routine the same so that I'd be able to monitor my reaction.     \n\nSome things that may or may not be useful?: \n\n1) My diet is good in terms of vegetable and protein intake, but I definitely do eat more junk and carbs than I should, and this is an area I'm working on.  Junk/processed food is where the majority of my fat and carb intake comes from :(\n\n2) I currently use sulphate and silicone free shampoo on my hair every 2-4 days, and have been doing so for about 4 years.  However, my scalp is quite oily and dandruff-prone, and these shampoos do not cut through my oil very effectively, so every 3-5 weeks I will do a wash or two with \"regular\" shampoo.  I do not use styling products or any heat on my hair (and have not done so for 4 years) and I use silicone-free conditioner on the ends of my hair when it is long (not currently).  I do not use any products on my nails or hands currently, aside from soap.     \n\n3) Over the past 4 years I have been sick several times and have gone through several rounds of antibiotics, the last time I did so was about 7 months ago).  \n\n4) I do prefer \"internal\" solutions to these problems such as natural supplements or specific foods to add to my diet, but if an external/topically applied product is highly recommended I am definitely willing to try it!  I am even beginning to consider trying Biotin again just in case there is a chance that my body has changed enough to have a different reaction to it than last time.  Would love to have your opinion on that option!   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for reading, I am definitely interested in your experience and any potential advice you may have.  I am totally willing and able to answer any questions or clarify any details in order to make my needs/the position I'm in more clear.  Thanks in advance!",

Hopefully that makes sense. It’s the same concept of omega 3, people take fish oil for omega 3 / DHA, and the fish get it from algae. You can just buy an algae supplement and get x10 the dose of quality DHA by going straight to the source.

[This is me](https://imgur.com/KoTQzoo) with my hair parted in the middle, air-dried and clean from a recent shower.\n  \nAbout 2 months ago I finally started taking supplements every single day. I take Biotin, Vitamin D and Magnesium (but I don't think the magnesium is helping my hair loss- I'm taking it to reduce my teeth grinding at night but I wanted to add it just in case)\n  \nI have suspected Vitamin D for a few years now, as I am part Mexican (need more Vitamin D than lighter skinned people), live in Michigan (not a lot of sunlight year round), and drastically reduced the amount of time I spent outside once I got my first computer around when I turned 18. I started losing my hair at age 18 so this lines up. My hair used to be so thick I couldn't fit it all in my hand at once, and now it's so thin I only have one hair style that I can wear without the entire top of my scalp being visible. I have to part my hair very far to the side to essentially have a toupee to conceal the top of my scalp! If I lift my hair up I can see my entire scalp in normal bathroom lighting. I did take some pictures of my current hair situation, which I will try to add in a bit here. \n  \nI had tried to see a doctor and they brushed me off and told me it's genetic hair loss and told me to use rogaine/other hair loss products. I absolutely hated the thought that I might have to take a drug for the rest of my life to solve the side effect rather than treat my problem at the source. But I hate seeing doctors, and I thought they would just tell me the same thing as the first doctor (women's hair loss is less studied and there weren't any other women's hair loss clinics in my area that I could find), so I stupidly let myself live with this potential problem. I had also gotten my thyroid tested (one of the other common hairloss causes) and the test said I was normal there as well. I had known I had a vitamin D deficiency, but nobody had told me that it could cause hair loss!\n  \nI did a lot of research on my own and discovered that vitamin D deficiency is known to cause hair loss, but it's not WELL known, so it didn't show up on any of the \"what vitamin deficiencies cause hair loss\" google searches I did.\n    \nFinally, a few months ago I started taking Vitamin D (and Biotin as well just in case), every single day instead of sporadically, and in the past 2 weeks or so I noticed, all of a sudden, that my hair had almost completely stopped falling out. This has only happened randomly maybe a handful of times over this past decade, and never more than two days in a row, so I know this isn't just coincidence. My hair loss has progressed a lot over this decade, but I am youngish still, so it's a toss-up as to how much will grow back. But I'm hopeful, excited and impatient! \n  \nIt's been absolutely disabling to me psychologically to have this hair loss as a woman. I have on numerous occasions considered shaving it all off but I couldn't go through with it. I've distanced myself from my friends so they wouldn't have to see me and my ugliness, and I've held off on job searching because I didn't want anyone else to see me or make fun of me. I used to love windy days, now I am terrified of them, and it really breaks my heart that I can be so scared of going outside. I am so overwhelmingly relieved that I may have found a solution, and I plan to update with another post in another 6-9 months or so, to give the process a good time to work. \n  \nI encourage anyone with hair loss to get their vitamin levels tested! Especially with the quarantine with everyone having been indoors and especially with modern society where people spend vastly more time indoors than ever before!",

But it is massively down from the \"fill up the hairbrush\" amount I had previously. I couldn't have expected the complete lack of shedding to continue.\n  \nI'm actually going to be making a dermatologist appointment in the next month or so to see if they can detect the hair growth. From previously talking to a dermatologist, they had said my follicles had miniaturized but were still there. So hopefully they will be able to look at my scalp and detect growth or improvement.\n  \nBut I promised myself I would wait a full 9 or so months to see real changes! I don't expect it to all grow back at once but by September or so I should see something!\n  \nI've also started an exercise regimen, so I'm hoping a side effect of that will help improve blood flow to all areas of my body including my scalp, and I'm eating a much better diet now as well. So I hope these things help as well!\n  \nI'll update again in a few months! Good or bad lol",

Obviously this is a YMMV thing and there may be other factors having an affect that I don't know of, but it might give you an idea of start to expect.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* My hair looks thicker, especially in the areas affected by thinning. \n* I've been using Finasteride and Minoxodil for 9 months but my hair was prone to breaking on the treated areas so hard to grow long. The hairs seem stronger now and I'm getting less hair loss during showing or brushing so it's finally starting to grow longer.\n* I've lost 40+ Lbs in the past year so some of my skin looked a bit doughy. It's helped to firm it up a bit, especially on the inside of my arms.\n* Also related to weight loss, I found my joints were starting to ache and feel loose. They definitely feel better now. \n* My fingernails are stronger and break a lot less, which is good as I do a manual job. \n\n**Cons (very short):**\n\n* My body hair has started to grow, let's say healthier. It desn't grow faster, but seems a bit thicker and darker. I could be imagining this or it could be where I stopped epilating and went back to shaving perhaps. Also bare in mind that I'm still pre HRT. This might actually be a good thing though as I've heard laser works best on darker hair and pail skin, which I have. \n* It's more money to spend on top of everything else related to transitioning.",

I stopped because my hair started falling out - I wasn't getting the proper nutrients. I started taking Biotin and MSM on a daily basis and I ate normally (surprisingly, I didn't gain back any of my weight until 5 years later). It took a full three months, again, for my hair to feel normal. Those three months were scary, though. I had nightmares about my hair falling out in clumps every night, I was too scared to brush my hair, and showers brought on anxiety attacks. \n\nI am not sure what the recommended daily dose for Biotin is; I just take 2 250mcg pills a day because the bottle says so. Vitamin B is also really good for hair, too. I get the vitamin B complex pills because they contain all of the B vitamins instead of just B12 or B6. I also take wild salmon fish oil pills, as well.\n\nGood luck!",

They were evaluated in terms of DLQI and laboratory characteristics, before and after DXP treatment, and were examined with a modified hair growth questionnaire.\n\nResults: Overall satisfaction with the appearance of the hair was described by the patients as 57.1% \" I am satisfied,\" 28.6% \"I am very satisfied,\" and 14.3% \"I am neutral (neither satisfied nor dissatisfied).\" There was a statistical difference between the mean DLQI scores before and after DXP treatment (P < .001). No statistical difference was found in the laboratory characteristics of the patients before and after DXP treatment (P > 0.05). No side effect was reported during DXP treatment.\n\nConclusion: Dexpanthenol is a safe and novel drug that may increase the quality of life in patients with FPHL.\n\n[Read the Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32960484/)",

But then this happened!\n  \nIt started the day after I went to a salon to get a hair cut (May 6th), and it hasn't stopped or slowed since.\n  \nIs it possible it could have been the salon shampoo and/conditioner? Is it just a coincidence that the dramatic hair shedding started the day after my appointment? My hair cut was a simple trim and did not involve any dying or styling other than blowdrying. \n  \nIt's been nearly 3 weeks now and my hair is visibly thinner than it was before this started, and it was already very thin. Whenever I shampoo and condition, I can pull out a handful of strands just doing normal washing. This has NEVER happened to me in my life!\n  \n I can also take strands from my scalp and run my finger along them and they will just come right out! Some strands do seem more \"anchored\" in my scalp, but others seem like they are just barely staying in. I am losing I would say 6 or so times the amount I had been losing before I got my haircut. Most of these strands seem to be quite thin as well, and I am losing short strands as well as long strands. Some strands are shorter than my finger while others are fully grown. \n  \nIs it possible I am having my own \"dread shed\" and that the thin and unhealthy hairs are having a mass exodus from my scalp to make way for new healthy strands? This is the best case scenario and what I will think of so I don't run off into the woods and become a complete recluse from society.

I can't grow it out longer due to constant breakage and split ends.   I don't shampoo every day, and when I do I use an organic, paraben and sulfate free shampoo and conditioner which I adore.  My fingernails sort of peel in layers, which my habit of picking at anything rough makes even worse, but the fact that they are brittle and peel on their own doesn't help things.\n\nSo, Biotin supplements:  Do they work?  What are your experiences? Would you recommend them? Is there anything else I should be trying?  Are there reasons against biotin? Are there any health concerns?  Anything, pro or against, supportive or precautionary.  I want to know! Thanks!",

My understanding is your body will use what it needs, and the rest will just make its way through. \n\nSo, I'd say go ahead and give it a try! Even if it doesn't help your hair and nails, it has other benefits, like helping your body metabolize fats and carbs!",

Biotin definitely makes your nails stronger, in my experience. Hair-wise, my hair felt no thicker and the same amount would fall out every day. It was actually the MSM that worked the most on my hair - less shedding every day, which left me with more hair on my head. I also felt less joint pain while using MSM.\n\nFrom taking both of these on and off during the last few years, my advice would be: give biotin a try for the nails, but don't expect any radical change in the way your hair looks (and if you want less shedding, try MSM). Be careful with the dosages of what you take with biotin. I've always taken between 500 to 1000 mcg, and in the higher end of the dose, I've experienced headaches and slight increase in acne. Not everyone has these reactions, obviously, but watch out - I didn't care that much about my nails being strong if it meant more headaches and acne. \n\n**EDIT:** I'd like to add also that not all vitamins are created equal. When I took just biotin by itself (I think the brand was Nature's Bounty or some such), that's when I felt the headaches and saw the increase in acne. But a few years ago, I took this pill from The Vitamin Shoppe (I think it was just called Hair, Skin, & Nails) that included [not only biotin, but other herbs and minerals](http://www.vitaminshoppe.com/store/en/browse/sku_detail.jsp?id=VS-1193) (look at the \"Supplement Facts\" tab)... these pills were super smelly, but they worked REALLY well, and I could definitely tell my hair was glossier than normal.

I also used to have to shave more often as well due to hair growing so quickly. The hair on my head was growing back which is a huge plus!\n\nI read on this sub that some people were experiencing breakouts specifically because of the biotin. This got me thinking and I decided to stop taking it. It's been maybe 1.5-2 weeks. Since then I've seen a big difference in my breakouts, especially on my chest, back and hairline. I also am finding my body hair growth has slowed right down. My nails are no longer growing at the same speed and strength as before.\n\nI would love some ideas of supplements that others recommend for hair and nail growth, that do not include biotin. I found this online and it contains Saw Palmetto which I've read is a good natural remedy. Is it safe to take while on Spiro? I am almost a week into a fairly strict low carb/keto diet.

IMO, if the ones from your doc weren't giving you the results you wanted, maybe it’s worth checking out some other options. I recently started using some gummies with biotin, folic acid, and a blend of vitamins that made a noticeable difference for me. You might wanna give [these supplements](https://link.getsosocial.co.uk/biotin-supplement) a shot. I found them to be way more effective than others I've tried. Good luck!",

But as you said there’s no technique too it really, it hurts abit, and you’ll get a few blood spots, but that’s increasing blood flow too the area then also, just make sure your rolling where you want results (remember not too roll too hard either) just apply pressure but not an obsurd amount, and do it once a week, and apply some type of moisturiser after doing it, or skin can become very dry.

Silica is good for hair loss. \n\nCoconut oil rubbed onto the scalp and left to sit for 10mins before washing helps speed up hair growth too.\n\nEdit: the first para should all be taken as dietary supplements, only the coconut oil should be used direct to skin :).",

        "body": "I'll put a few drops of castor oil on my scalp before bed, rub in, sleep. and it just gives my fine hair some texture and volume in the am. I really like it! My hair is really dry so I only wash a couple times a week but I  don't have build up from it. Eyelashes I like Physician's Formula Lash Booster Eyeliner, and brows I use Rapidbrow. These only work if you keep using them and the Rapidbrow can get pricey initially using twice a day, but once I got brows where I want them I cut back to once a day use which saves some cash and maintains them. It may sound excessive but I went went through three years of chemo and it permanently wrecked my hair texture, color, thickness, and growth. \n\nNails are growing crazy long and strong since I started using Leven Rose Emu Oil (thicker than jojoba which I still use for less dry areas) topped with silicone lotion to keep moisture sealed in. I put a drop beneath each nail (does that makes sense?), a few drops on my hands, and massage from there. Massage your cuticle while doing this because increased blood flow will help stimulate circulation and growth. Don't let your hands dry out (a huge problem for me) as it just leaves the nails ready to split. \n\nI also use this inexpensive clear top coat called Nail Aid One Minute Artificials. This stuff turned out to be magic for me as I'm a bit careless with my nails. Still not used took them being so long. It's not a gel/acrylic, just a regular polish that is nice and tough, also the best base/top coat I've found to make my polishes last.",
