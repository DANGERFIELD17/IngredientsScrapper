    "body": "Hi everyone! I posted this on another sub not too long ago and because of the positive reaction I wanted to share it with you all. Hope you like it.      \n      \nLittle bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n                \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My pimples reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n  \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**\n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.

    "body": "Little bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n        \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My acne reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n   \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**   \n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.",

Finished with my 2 component hard wax oil homebrew (BLO, Beeswax, Carnauba, Paraffin, D-limonene) and TreWax.\n\nI was originally inspired by another post on the sub in which another user modified the dimensions and geometry to fit their space. To be honest, I didn't like their result for myself but I liked the idea and it sent me into research mode to learn more about their inspiration.\n\nThis project was my first time using CAD and I used it as a way to learn SketchUp. I wish I could have looked at an original by John Keal for Brown Saltman in person but I couldn't find a local example. As such, my model was developed using measurements and photos of the original piece. The geometry and dimensions are probably very close to the original, though I did take some liberties.\n\nFeedback and questions are welcomed. And thanks, r/woodworking. Couldn't have done it without you.",

Same symptoms. I spent much $$ on all different brands of lipstick to test. (This was before Sephora.) I could wear lipstick about an hour before the swelling got too bad. I'd start the night with lipstick and end with vaseline. I was successful with mixing in loose eye shadow pigment with vaseline, but it was usually too much work.\n\n It came on sudden, not like I wore a lot of makeup before, but I was able to wear lip products my junior year. A couple of years before I got married at 27 I noticed I could wear lipstick for longer without getting itchy. I think Bite was the first I could wear successfully for long periods. Now I'm fine with most products, but I haven't tried lipstains nor those lip pumping products. Because why? Everything used to be a plumping product. I also find chapstick and lipsmackers to be too drying still, I like Burts Bees.\n\nSo now I can wear lipstick again, but don't now because no one can see it under a mask. I had no allergies growing up, lip products was the first and only for about a decade. Led to funny looks on medical history forms. The body is weird.",

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

It is commercially obtained by centrifugal separation or steam distillation. Due to its strong scent it functions as a botanical insecticide but cats also find the scent unpleasant. So, if your cats won't leave your plants alone give limonene a try!\nIt is also a popular profile terpene in cannabis (ex: Super Lemon Haze, Chernobyl, Berry White).\nD-limonene is commonly used as a less toxic substitute to xylene in histology when clearing dehydrated specimens. Clearing agents are solvents compatible (miscible) with alcohols and melted paraffin wax.\nIf applied to the skin, it can cause contact dermatitis - it is flammable as a liquid and toxic to aquatic life.\n\nIf you're looking to add some zest to your life, try limonene.",

Til at løse dette problem har jeg konstrueret et lille program der kan læse ingredienslisterne på Matas hjemmeside og efter lidt manuel oprydning i data er jeg nået frem til en lidt mindre liste og tænkte jeg ville dele mine resultater her.\n\nJeg har været ret striks i mine krav, da jeg er af den opfattelse at solcremer o.l. bør beskytte mod solen og derfor ikke bør indeholde parfume, farve, smag(!?) og lignende skrammel der ikke tilfører nogen værdi.\n\nI alt var der 445 produkter på det tidspunkt jeg hentede data (mindre end 2 uger siden).\n\nAf disse havde 103 ikke opført ingredienser og er derfor ikke med.\n\nAf de resterende havde 135 hormonforstyrende stoffer, mere specifikt er produkter med følgende ingredienser sorteret fra:\n\n* avobenzone\n* octocrylene\n* lavendel\n* benzophenone-3\n* benzyl salicylate\n* bht\n* bha\n* butylparaben\n* methylparaben\n* propylparaben\n* ethylparaben\n* homosalate\n\nAf de resterende 207 produkter havde 73 opført parfume/fragrance/aroma o.l. som vitterligt kan dække over hvad som helst inklusiv skadelige stoffer og er derfor sorteret fra.\n\nAf de resterende 134 produkter havde 2 opført parfume blot under deres kemiske betegnelse, mere specifikt:\n\n* limonene\n* linalool\n* citronellol\n* geraniol\n\nAf de resterende 132 produkter havde 42 opført ingredienser som jeg vil betegne \"problematiske\". Der er ikke helt enighed om de er skadelige eller ej, men jeg valgte at eksludere produkter med:\n\n* sodium lauryl sulfate\n* sodium laureth sulfate\n* methylisothiazoline\n* denatureret alcohol\n* propylene glycol\n* benzyl alcohol\n* benzyl alcohol citral\n* benzyl benzoate\n\nAf de resterende 90 produkter havde 12 farver i. Dvs. enhver ingrediens der starter med CI efterfulgt af et nummer, dog ikke zink og titanium dioxid da de fungerer som solfiltre.\n\nHerefter sorterede jeg alle produkter fra med en SPF værdi mindre end 30 og så er der 66 tilbage fordelt på følgende 4 kategorier sorteret efter billigste pris pr. liter/kg:\n\n**SOLCREMER/OILER:**\n\n|Produkt|Pris pr. liter/kg|Url|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Matas Striber

        "body": "Personligt hader jeg apps som kemiluppen af personlig holdning, for mig er det fearmongering  og får mig til at tænke på interesseorganisationen EWG 😅\n\nJeg går med solcreme dagligt i fjæset, det er SPF 50+ og 1/4 tsk af det. På denne tid af året bliver jeg nemt solskoldet, resten af året er det for min huds skyld + jeg bruger hudpleje der gør huden endnu mere sensitiv overfor solen (glykolsyre). \n\nDet mest vigtige for mig er at det er behageligt at bruge, hvis det ikke er det så får jeg det ikke taget på... I den forbindelse er jeg glad for Niveas ansigts solcremer bl.a. deres spf 50 face til sensitive hud (dog er den dårlig under makeup) og dem fra Garnier til ansigtet, de har bl.a. en tyndtflydende solcrememælk der tørrer mat på huden. \n\nJeg har prøvet Matas egen solcreme, men jeg kan slet ikke deres konsistenser! \n\nTil kroppen er enten et apoteksmærke, som f.eks. La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Avene osv. gode og ellers så laver Garnier og Nivea hæderlige solcremer til gode priser. \n\nI forhold til din liste af ingredienser du valgte også at ekskludere, synes jeg især det er interessant at sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, denatured alcohol og propylene glycol er inkluderet. De er alle fire totalt almindelige ingredienser i hudpleje (Dog er sodium lauryl sulfate og sodium laureth sulfate mest almindelige i sæber og renseprodukter) og jeg forstår ikke hvorfor du har skåret dem væk? Denatureret sprit fordamper efter applikation (og kan hjælpe med at solcremen tørrer ind) og ja det kan være udtørrende i nogle formularer, men ved hudpleje er det altid vigtigt at tage højde for formularen og ikke de individuelle ingredienser kun. Du kender jo selv at du kan bruge vand, mel, sukker og æg til at lave en del forskellige opskrifter, hvis du varierer metode og forhold... \n\nPropylene glycol i solcreme kan hjælpe solcremen med at sprede sig bedre på huden og hjælper med at opløse andre ingredienser i solcremen, da det er er godt solvent til mere hydrofobe stoffer. Det eneste jeg ved til kan være problematisk ved propylene alcohol er at det kan være irriterende for huden i høje koncentrationer (50% eller mere), men du vil sjældent se det brugt så koncentreret :p\n\nMichelle Wong, som er kosmetisk kemiker og har en PhD i kemi har skrevet på hendes blog om både [propylene glycol](https://labmuffin.com/what-are-propylene-and-butylene-glycol-and-are-they-safe/) og [SLS](https://labmuffin.com/whats-wrong-with-sls/).",

    "body": "Description on website:\n“Lip balm that imparts a subtle fragrance at the tip of your nose. It provides immediate nourishment with rich plant-based oils, keeping dry lips moist and soft. The scent, made with safe ingredients, is packaged in a handy case resembling the smooth curves and texture of an egg, giving you a pleasant feeling anytime, anywhere.”\n\nhttps://www.tamburins.com/en/item/1695801896/\n\n\nI love eggs so the adorable container is instantly appealing, i love drinking milk tea and it smells like one, i could always use more lip balms, so i decided to get one when i saw it at ICN.\n\n \nBought for USD19 duty-free at ICN airport.\n\n\nMy lips are okay, doesnt get dry or crack often that i need lip balm everyday but they’re nice to layer under my lip colour or gloss.\n\n\nPackaging & Application:\n * Egg-shaped tube, twist up for more product. Comes in a sturdy, fancy box. Great for gifting.\n\n\n * Material & Design:\nEgg container is most likely made out of some plastic material but textured to resemble real eggshell. Imagine the softest sandpaper. No info on website.\n\n\n * Ease of Use:\nOpen cap, apply directly. Twist up the egg for more product.\n\n\n * Portability: It’s a flat little egg and fits in \n the slimmest bags, very handy.\n\n\n * Durability: Sturdy, quality packaging. Use some caution when taking cap off and putting back on. Certain angles may cause the cap to come in contact with the balm. I accidentally scooped a tiny bit of it just now with the cap.\n\n\nIngredients & Formulation:\n * Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Dimer Dilinoleate, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Seed Oil, Phytosteryl/Behenyl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Synthetic Wax, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Fragrance(Parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Lecithin, Geraniol, Limonene, Tocopherol\n\n\nManufactured by Cosmax Co. Ltd.\n\n\n * feels oily, smooth and thin upon application- elegant formulation.\n\n\nScent & Flavor:\n\nTop: bergamot, lemon \nMiddle: black tea \nBase: coconut\n\nWebsite:  “based on black tea with a subtle flower smell, this scent brings you the soft scent on the tip of your nose when you drink a glass of black tea with a drop of warm milk, and the warmth gives you the comfort you feel when you take a full rest. Fresh and refreshing bergamot and lemon blend with the bittersweet feeling of black tea, adding layers for daily use. The coconut note adds a soft and sweet finish to the lingering fragrance.”\n\n\nMy thoughts:\n * subtle, pleasant fragrance of milk tea as if you just had a sip.\n * milk tea scent fades away after a while and does mot linger, good if sensitive to smell but still enjoys some fragrance.\n * unscented/unflavored version also available.\n\n\nPerformance & Effectiveness:\n * Immediate Hydration: when used in comparison with my current lip balm from hersteller and lip oil from Sampar addict, this balm is definitely more moisturizing.\n\n\n * Long-Term Hydration: one application lasts 3-4 hours without drinking/eating.\n\n\n * Healing Properties: pretty much immediate relief for chapped lips soon after application.\n\n\n * Protection: tested in a dry, airplane cabin for 7 hours. Held up well and lips remain moisturised upon disembarking.\n\n\n * Overall Comfort: feels pleasantly creamy on the lips and milk tea scent fades over time.\n\n\nLongevity & Value for Money:\n * i dont use lip balms often/everyday, only as needed.\n * Considering the price of USD19 for 5g of product, i dont think this is cost-effective.\n\n\nWho Would This Be Good For?\nGood for you if you find eggs cute, enjoys drinking milk tea,  need a quick relief for chapped lips and most importantly have USD19 laying around for fun money.\n\n\nWould You Repurchase?\n * No WNRP but only because i already bought it once and have the container now. I plan to refill it myself with a cheaper alternative. Would not pay USD19 for another lip balm.\n\n\nOverall Rating:\n * 4 out of 5, would WRP if it was USD9 and not USD19.\n\n\nTL;DR cute lil egg lip balm that smells of delicious milk tea, instant relief for chapped lips but quite pricey at USD19 for 5grams. Fun gift and souvenir.",

I prefer balms and salves that melt into oils like Smith’s Rosebud to hydrate rather than exclusively occlusive waxy “balms” though so it might just be personal preference. It’s pretty on my shelf but I don’t ever reach for it and would literally rather use anything else. \n\nOn a related note, the hince highlight balm with no color is a great giant lip balm for me, it’s everything I want (not for a face highlight formula though).",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

I’ve also used it to kill mildew or puke odors when washing alone wouldn’t remove them. \n\nAnd the fact that it breaks up soap makes it amazing for cleaning soap scum in shower. It’s also better for cleaning toilet bowls than any commercial toilet product I’ve tried (I suppose that falls under mineral deposits like you mentioned). I do follow it up with a stronger disinfectant after though (vinegar is actually a disinfectant, just a relatively weak one).\n\nAlso I love hydrogen peroxide but fyi it IS corrosive, and just like vinegar it can damage some surfaces and finishes.\n\nI think just like any cleaning product it’s about knowing where and how to use it.\n\nEdit to add: I think cutting grease with vinegar is the funniest misconception because of how many people have eaten oil and vinegar with bread at Italian restaurants - it’s like oil and water, I can’t remember the word but they definitely stay separate!",

        "body": "I think it's good to clarify for anyone who uses vinegar for cleaning in their home why this is the case, since the OP was bent on being condescending.\n\n  \nAcids are good at breaking down mineral deposits, which is why its good to use in the shower, especially if you live in an area with hard water. While they can break down grease and carry it away, its not as effective as cleaners from the opposite end of the scale, bases.   \n\n\nBases (sodium bicarbonate, sodium borate, etc) are much better at picking up dirt and grease, which is why Borax and Washing Soda is sold as a detergent booster (it raises the ph  making the solution more basic and more capable of cleaning off grease)   \n\n\nAmmonia and bleach are both bases as well and relatively caustic which is why people use them to disinfect(bleach) or clean super greasy ovens(ammonia).  \n\n\nAnd I HARDCORE support the second to last statement. So many home remedies want you to have both an acid AND a base in it, which causes both to neutralize and make the home remedy less effective. The foam you see when this reaction happens... is not a surfactant, it is simply the chemical reaction of neutralization as it creates heat while turning the solution into saltwater. This foam doesn't clean. Anything that comes off after doing this only came off from being touched by the base first before the acid.   \n\n\nI would add that baking soda is just as good at removing odor, so good you can leave it sitting in a fridge to prevent weird smells. it'd be better to toss that in with your laundry to deodorize than vinegar.   \n\n\nThe proof is in the pudding. And in this case, the pudding is tested and verifiable science.",

    "body": "For some, surgery is the only practical solution - even though it may have its own drawbacks and lifelong side-effects. But here are some things to try on your own, before you make that commitment:\n\n* **Soft belly** \\- Practice keeping a soft belly. Keeping your core tight, sucking in your abs, etc. reduces space in your abdomen and prevents the possibility of your stomach dropping down. Try to keep a soft belly, even when doing things that can cause/exacerbate HH (e.g., lifting objects, standing up, sneezing, coughing, etc.)\n* **Abdominal breathing** \\- Breathe from your belly, instead of from your chest. Chest-breathing means you are keeping your belly tight.\n* **Self-massage** \\- To manipulate the stomach downward. Repeat at least daily for at least several days. Example video: [https://youtu.be/qofS1iVuwoQ](https://youtu.be/qofS1iVuwoQ)\n   * This video focuses on pressing on different areas than the first video. I haven't tried it but some commenters on the video got relief from it: [https://youtu.be/vgLdr8Kkz7E](https://youtu.be/vgLdr8Kkz7E)\n* **Heel drops** \\- Essentially: drinking some water to add weight in the stomach, then drop on your heels to cause inertia to make your stomach drop. Repeat at least daily for at least several days.\n   * Example video: [https://youtu.be/qu2MQqS2ucY](https://youtu.be/qu2MQqS2ucY)\n   * Trampoline video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iJOrRcZpJk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iJOrRcZpJk)\n* **Reflux issues** \\- Is it reflux, GERD, or LPR (aka \"silent reflux\")?  See: [Acid reflux, GERD and LPR: Know the difference](https://www.baycare.net/blog/acid-reflux-gerd-and-lpr-know-the-difference/). You may have been prescribed PPIs but are wondering about other options. The following supplements and foods may or may not be appropriate for you, and you may want to discuss them with your doctor before using.\n   * **Deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) -** a form of licorice\n      * DGL comes in chewable tablets and soothes and coats; really helped with reflux for me. (example: Natural Factors brand on Amazon)\n   * **Alginate or Alginic Acid**\n      * Alginic acid creates a kind of foam on top of stomach fluids which can reduce acid moving upward. (example: Acid Block on Amazon).\n   * **d-Limonene**\n      * d-Limonene is from orange peel. This is my go-to for LPR (aka 'silent reflux'). It is thought to help prompt the esophageal sphincter to close. But for some, it may increase burning, so go slow. (example: Jarrow brand on Amazon)\n   * **Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)**\n      * Apple Cider Vinegar appears to help many people with reducing reflux symptoms. Start w/just a tablespoon or two amount in a glass of water, every morning. Increase to 4-5 tblsp, and see how it goes. It improves the condition over time, so its not a good choice for an acute flare-up. I never had good luck w/ACV gummies and such; just use real ACV.\n      * Along the lines of ACV, a small amount (couple of tbsp) of sauerkraut each day might help over time. Kimchi may also work or be detrimental due to spices.\n* **Diet** \\- Diet is highly individual.\n   * Eat smaller meals; so, e.g.,  you might eat 5 times a day instead of 3.\n   * Eat more calorie-dense foods, which results in less volume of food needed.\n   * Avoid foods that expand in the stomach (e.g., because those foods absorb liquids).\n   * Drink minimal amounts of fluids with meals.\n   * Eat 'healthier' - avoid junk food.\n   * Identify trigger foods/drinks that exacerbate symptoms and remove/replace them.\n   * Avoid eating within 4-5 hours of bedtime.\n* **Weight** \\- If overweight, reducing weight may help.\n\nIt may take several days/weeks or more to get results, but hopefully your hernia will respond to one or more of these so that you experience some degree of relief.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not medical advice - it is opinion.*",

        "body": "I wish someone had told me these things 10 years ago when I got HH:\n\n1. Do not try to manipulate your stomach, you will hurt yourself! Your stomach is constantly moving. Your hernia is sliding. When your stomach moves up, other organs, and tissue, move too. You can experience some relief from manipulation, but that can't last long. And the danger of hurting yourself is much greater.\n2. Avoid sitting, bending over, jumping, running, and exercising 2 hours after a meal! Walk as much as you can during the day. Avoid pulling and pushing too hard.\n3. Forget about alcohol!\n4. Be very careful when you listen to doctors who can only be doctors on YouTube!\n5. If you have to, use PPIs but not longer than 3 weeks.\n6. To some types of foods, the stomach reacts by secreting more acid. These foods are harder to digest. Listen carefully to your stomach and find your trigger foods. Some of them are common to everyone: all citrus, alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, junk food, processed food, too spicy food, too fat, too sweet, and carbonated drinks.\n7. Eat 5-6 times during the day, and take smaller meals.\n8. The thing with HH is that you need to have a half-empty stomach at all times. So, limit your water intake: not more than 2dl at a time, 30min before, and 1 - 2 hours after a meal.",

        "body": "I am 32 years old diagnosed with Haitius hernia two years back. At the beginning doctor prescribed me 40 mg rabeprazole. 20 mg In morning and 20 in evening. Along with hernia I was also diagnosed with barretts esophagus. So the doctor told me I have to take ppi for whole life. Then after three endoscopy it was found that barretts have not changed at all so he reduced the dose to 20 mg daily. Now taking ppi comes with side effects at first I was very tired and in every 2 3 weeks there were bloating and indigestion which ends with vomiting. This was the case when I eat outside or more than limit or refined flour. When the dose was reduced the symptoms ease and last I had only two three episodes of bloating and indesgtion. But the side effects of ppi caused my b12 level to drop so much I started feeling numbness in my left arm. So right now I have started taking b12 supplements because ppi makes absorption of b12 difficult. And also I reduced my dose of ppi to 10 mg. \nThe endoscopy is due in 2 years to check berretts length and possibly biopsy. I hope it will not increase in length because somedays when I am more active reflux and coughing due to it comes back. \n\nThings which help me are\n\n1. Eating less and slowly.\n\n2. Sleeping on a wedge pillow so in morning I don't feel acidic.\n\n3. When I was taking 40 mg ppi my stomach felt loose but after reducing dose it feels tight and strong.\n\n4. Workout in morning helps in easy digestion and reduces stress and depression. \n\n5. Long walk at night prevents bloating and helps food to digest.\n\n6. Nux vomica (homeopathic medicine) helps in bloating.\n \n7.  eat regularly and at fixed times and having dinner 3 hours before sleep\n\n8. Drinking more and water and eating raw foods like salads and fruits.\n\n9. Putting ice on stomach helps in case of bloating.\n\n\nI have never tried any exercise and after having a bad episode of bloating last night I am thinking to try some exercise mentioned in this thread. Please reply if anyone found any exercise beneficial. Since I don't want to try anything which increase hernia. I was also diagnosed with gallstones and after consulting gi surgeon I am planning for gallstone removal surgery. Hernia surgery has lot of side effects and most of the cases it is not successful so I am not in favor of it therefore trying to fix it if possible.",

There is no silver bullet, and some days are definately worse than others, but I have made some changes that let me stay off of ppi's and just use antacids from time to time. I do keep ppi's around but just in case but I have not used them in years.\n\nDefinite no no's for me: \n- Chocolate. \n- Coffee.\n- Dairy.\n\nOne of the things I've learned is that if I eat anything that upsets my HH, it takes time for the hernia to calm down again. Maybe a couple of days. It's easy to wonder what I did wrong today when what actually happened was I ate something the day before, or the day before that, and it is still causing me issues today. I find it takes a couple of days for everything to return to what is normal for me. \n\nIncluded no chocolate, coffee or dairy, I became vegan. I am not sure this is important but I do eat this way and I have got a better handle on my HH than I had before. I think a plant based is just easier on your stomach than eating animal products.\n\nMy first meal of the day is always just fruit. I have no problem eating a cantaloupe, a pineapple or a few apples. I find anything other than just fruit and I have issues. Once an issue starts, it's there all day. \n\nWhen lunch comes around, I can eat pretty much so what ever I want, and almost in what ever quantities within reason, but I cannot touch any fluids with the meal or for hours afterwards. I leave about three or more hours after eating before I can drink anything. Drinking with eating robs me of all my energy and causes constant burping and bloating discomfort. \n\nI also find movement after eating causes issues. ESPECIALLY if I have injested any fluids. I find I can drink with a meal at night though, because I mostly sit around afterwards before ending up in bed.\n\nI am still living with a HH with varying levels of discomfort every single day, but I have been able to stop using ppi's to manage it.",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure.

    "body": "Some of you might remember me. I was one of the moderators here for half a decade or so until my life got busy enough that it became difficult to keep up.\n\nI have a small fragrance line myself and I occasionally make fragrances for other brands. Occasionally websites like Fragrantica and Now Smell this will write articles about my fragrances. I'm by no means a famous perfumer, but. I've worked enough as a perfumer to have insight into how fragrances are made.\n\nThe average person doesn't really think about what's actually in their fragrances any more than the average person really considers what flavors blend together to make up the taste of cola. (As a side note, you can make a passable cola flavor out of orange, lime cinnamon, lemon, nutmeg and coriander). When people do start thinking about it, they inevitably come across fragrance notes.\n\nFragrance notes are both incredibly useful and completely misleading because NOTES ARE NOT INGREDIENTS! Notes are the impressions that the fragrance creator thinks a lay person might get from smelling the fragrance. They aren't necessarily the ingredients used in the fragrance, and also...this is another important bit...they're not necessarily even what the perfumer was attempting to make the fragrance smell like.\n\nThere's a fundamental misconception on the part of most consumers. Most consumers think that fragrances are made largely from familiar materials. Orange, lemon, jasmine, rose, birch leaves, lily of the valley, etc. Ok, maybe most people realize that most fragrances contain synthetic materials, but there's quite often an implicit assumption that the synthetics are a synthetic version of a natural material...in other words, that the synthetic is an attempt to recreate a smell that is found in nature and that all (or at least most) of the smells in a modern fragrance CAN be reproduced with naturals. I suppose that if you asked someone \"do you think that all synthetics are an attempt to recreate a natural smell?\" they would think about it and quickly come to the conclusion that this doesn't really make sense, but most people haven't actually stopped and thought about it. I see evidence of this assumption all over the place online:\n\n\"I'm looking for all natural version of [fragrance X]\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a less synthetic version of Sauvage\"\n\n\"Can someone tell me which essential oils I can mix together to make an aquatic smell like cool water.\"\n\nIt's really only pretty recently that there's been any real visibility (to the general public) into what materials go into a commercial fragrance so this is an understandable point of view.\n\nIt's very, very wrong though.\n\nWe need to take a giant step back clarify some things.\n\nNatural oils (essential oils/absolute oils/SCO2 extracts/etc) are typically made up of dozens or hundreds of different materials. They're like miniature perfumes in and of themselves with top notes, heart notes and base notes. They're complex and beautiful, but they can only be manipulated in a limited way. They're like photographs.\n\nSpecialty bases are typically made up of dozens of individual ingredients, some natural, some man made, some that exist in nature, some that didn't exist until they were created in a lab in the 60's. Basically, the sky's the limit. You generally don't know exactly what's in them, but they're produced by suppliers that you can be pretty sure will still be making them in 20 years. Sometimes, they're direct attempts to reproduce (or improve upon) a natural smell, for reasons of cost, safety or performance. Sometimes, they're just a novel smell, like Givaudan's aquatic smelling Ultrazur base. These are like computer generated images.\n\nIsolates are ingredients made of a single type of molecule. They can be naturally derived or lab made. They can exist in nature or not. They have names like linalool, coumarin, limonene, ambroxide, methyl dihydrojasmonate and you can describe them typically find the chemical formula for them. A lot of them have trade names that are shorter and refer to one company's version. E.g. Hedione is a trade name for methyl dihydrojasmonate. Quite often isolates can also be found in natural oils.  Natural lavender oil is typically ~42% linalyl actate and ~40% linalool. When composing fragrances, I'll use linalool and linalyl acetate as isolates as well. Sometimes I'll use it them to \"tune\" other ingredients that already contain them, but not in the quantities I want (like lavender). Sometimes I'll use them to add a sweet, floral character to completely unrelated materials. If natural oils are like photographs and bases are like CGI, isolates are like paints. You have the most control, but it takes the most skill to turn them into something beautiful and complex.\n\n\"Aromachemical\" is a catch all term used to describe these fragrant materials, though it typically connotes materials that are either isolates or bases.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, let's take a look at how commercial fragrances are created.  The easiest way to do that is to take a look at a formula:\n\nCologne accord:\n\nThis is an example formula for a \"cologne\" accord that was composed by Givaudan. It's by no means a finished fragrance, but most everyone would recognize the smell. It's a fresh, slightly sweet, slightly bitter, slightly green smell that often finds its way into men's fresh fragrances in one way or another (though that's not to say that this exact formula does).\n\n* Florhydral - 10\n* Exaltolide Total - 10\n* Ultrazur - 15\n* Peonile - 60\n* Petitgrain oil -70\n* Ethylene Brassylate - 90\n* Aurantiol Pure - 100\n* Geranyl Acetate - 120\n* Linalyl Acetate - 220\n* Dihydro Myrcenol - 305\n\nTotal: 1000\n\nLets take a look at these ingredients one by one:\n\n**Florhydral** is the trade name for an isolate. It is a floralizer that can add a sort of fresh, green, floral note to fragrances. It is not found in nature\n\n**Exaltolide** is another single molecule, a white musk. It's very delicately animalic, with the characteristic smell of a white musk. It's been used as a reference white musk because it's so typical of the \"white musk\" family.\n\n**Ultrazur** is a specialty base from Givaudan. It's marine smelling, more oceanic than the Calone 1951 found in Cool Water. By itself, in concentration, it reminds me very much of fabric softener.\n\n**Peonile** is another \"not found in nature\" molecule. It has a sort of rosy, sort of geraniumlike, sort of peonylikee sort of grapefruitlike oder and acts as a volumizer and fixative. Odor descriptions that call to mind an assortment of known materials are fairly common, but it’s important to note that they don’t mean that it smells like x+y+z. It just means that they have facets that are reminiscent of these materials in some way.\n\n**Petitgrain oil** is a natural oil made from the greenery of a citrus tree. Usually from orange trees, but varieties from mandarin, lemon and all sorts of other citrus are also available.\n\n**Ethylene brassylate** is a sweet, floral, white musk that can smell a touch old fashioned to some people by itself, or in really high concentrations. It’s still a fairly clean musk, however. Yet another single molecule.\n\n**Aurantiol** is a very, very commonly used material in fragrances, particularly men’s fragrances. It’s a single molecule (more or less). Aurantiol is a Schiff Base, which is a class of materials that you get when you combine an aldehyde and an amine and they react with each other. Most amines don’t smell very good, but one of them, something called methyl anthranilate, does. It’s found in white florals, particularly neroli, as well as grapes. Artificial grape flavor is basically methyl anthranilate. Hydroxyitronellal is an aldehyde that is often said to smell as close as any single material does to Lily of the Valley. When they’re mixed together and heated, you get water and a very thick,  highlighter yellow colored schiff base that smells like a more mild version of methyl anthranilate. It’s sweet, long lasting and reminiscent of orange blossom/neroli and grape.\n\n**Geranyl acetate** is the acetate version of geraniol. It’s a single molecule that is literally found in hundreds of natural oils. Everything from oregano and thyme to ylang ylang, rose, geranium and neroli, to fir needle and frankincense. It’s everywhere (much like linalool and linalyl actetate). It’s sweet, fruity-floral, and vaguely green smelling. It also has a smell that I think of as the “acetate smell,” which can make it smell “chemically” to some people in isolation, even though it’s found everywhere in nature.\n\n**Linalyl acetate** is another material like geranyl acetate that’s found all over the place in nature. Natural lavender oil is ~42% linalyl acetate. It’s also found in most of the natural oils I mentioned for geranyl actetate. The description for it is also very similar to geranyl acetate, but it’s more lavendery and less rosy. I really like this material and use it when I was to add an ethereal fruity/floral sweetness to a composition \n\n**Dihydromyrcenol** is aggressively fresh, cold and almost harsh. It’s somewhat reminiscent of citrus and lavender. Mostly, though, it smells like laundry detergent. It was used to scent laundry detergent for years before it made it into fine fragrance. At first it was used in tiny doses, but by the 1980’s is was being used much more prominently. Something like 10% of the formula of Drakkar Noir was dihydromyrcenol. It’s found in trace amounts in nature, but nothing natural really smells prominently of it.\n\nSo now that i’ve explained all the materials, let’s take a look at the formula. Here are some observations:\n\nNatural oils from recognizable sources only make up 7% of the accord. There are other materials that are found in nature, but they’re all isolates, one alien smelling molecule refined from a more familiar smelling material.\nMore than half of the formula is made from 2 molecules. More than 90% Is made from 8.\nThe amounts of materials used can vary wildly. Material strength is in no way consistent.\n\nThe perfumer who composed this formula painted the majority of the formula in broad strokes from single molecule aromachemicals and then filled in depth and details with natural petitgrain oil, and tiny amounts of a specialty base (ultrazur) and a powerful aldehyde (florhydral). \n\nI didn’t compose this, and I can’t speak for the perfumer who did, but I can imagine how it might have been composed. I’ll walk you through my imagining of the perfumer’s process:\n\nI imagine the accord was inspired by the petitgrain, but the perfumer wanted something fresher and more stylized and abstract, in the same way a graphic designer might prefer a stylized logo to a photo.  Dihydromyrcenol is fresh and powerful, but also cold and harsh and almost bitter. It’s a good compliment to petitgrain, but right off the bat, I know it’s not going to be suitable by itself unless i’m trying to just modify the smell of petitgrain a little bit by adding a teeny tiny bit dihydromyrcenol. It needs some cushion, something to cut the harshness. Geranyl acetate and linalyl acetate add a niche cushioning effect, can be used liberally and are both found in petitgrain, so they’ll go well with it. By itself, that composition is still cold and bitter. It needs a bit more warmth, but not a candylike warmth. Something keeping in like with the petitgrain. Aurantiol is the obvious choice. The scent of orange tree leaves go well with the scent of the orange blossoms that nestle amongst them. In keeping with the “more abstract” theme though, we don’t want to just dump neroli or orange blossom absolute into this. Too much complexity can leave a composition smelling muddled, and we want the bitter, fresh, green petitgrain to be the star of the show here, not the neroli. Plus, neroli is quite expensive and not as long lasting as aurantiol. We add the aurantiol for warmth. The peonile for volume and some white musks for depth. It’s pretty common to use multiple musks in a fragrance because many people are anosmic to some musks, so you want to make sure they’re able to smell at least one of them.\n\nThen as finishing touches, we add a hint of Ultrazur, which adds a bit of modern sophistication and florhydral, which in tiny amounts adds a bit of a dewy, natural, green smell to the composition.\n\nThis composition isn’t about taking familiar smells and mixing them together like some sort of fruit salad with hunks of this and hunks of that. It’s about taking an idea and enhancing aspects of it, rebalancing it until it fits the vision. It’s more like painting than making a collage. It’s not necessarily as detailed or accurate, but it’s not supposed to be. Degas wasn’t trying to create photorealistic ballerinas. Van Gogh wasn’t trying to accurately render the night sky. They were trying to evoke an impression. Perfumers are the same way.\n\nIf that fragrance doesn’t smell like realistic rose/jasmine/cedar/etc, chances are, it wasn’t intended to. The perfumer wasn’t trying to make a realistic jasmine and failing, the perfumer was trying to make an entirely new smell that just has aspects that are jasminelike.\n\nBreaking it apart into notes is actually counterproductive in a lot of ways.\n\n...but that’s a subject for another post.",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

Mu best friend passed away in front of my eyes through a fire ( she was fully on fire ). My ex boyfriend of 5 years got engaged to someone else who he recently met. My family got bankerupt.\n\n2) I'm a very hardworking girl who runs her own company and have always been super productive.\n\n3) I was having recurring sinus infections the entire year and have a deviated septum.\n\nPast symtoms: Severe Health anxiety, recurring sinus infections \n\nBy December I was very exhausted and fatigued.\nI went for a holiday and drank a lot in December ( The usual party month )  I came back and found on that my dad may be arrested. \n\nI started experiencing severe stomach pain and fatigue in the weeks after and I thought it would have happened because of partying too hard and alcohol in December. I started having bad constipation and found blood in my poop ( twice) \n\nNot the best thing for someone with health anxiety. My mom told me it was due to hemmoriids and not to worry. I was super anxious the entire month.\n\n- My stomach was gassy and painful and my dad spoke to a GI specialist who prescribed medicine at the same time.\n\n- I started having neck pain which was growing very slowly over the past year. A lot of my work is on the phone so my posture isn't the best and I was anyway going through so much stress.\n\n- My sinus infection was really bad in January and I had antibiotics.\n\n- By first week February I was having severe light headidness which hasn't gone till day.\n\n- I produce a lot of white thick phlegm. It's also foul smelling and all day in my throat.\n\n- my stomach still feels gassy\n\n- I have some rectom burning at times\n\n- my neck and shoulders are very stiff \n\nThe worst part is the constant light headidness and fatigue. It's like an imbalance which is always there.\n\n-I've had blood work and it's all clear. My internist thinks it's neck tension related has reffered me to a chiropractor. I've been going to the chriopractor and he said my muscles are very tense and it will take time to heal.\n\n- MY ent says I also have a problem with my eustachian tubes which causes constant pressure in my ears.\n\n- My stomach still feels weird but I haven't gone to a GI specialist due to Covid.\n\n- I've been to a neoruologist who says I'm fine and just anxious and very stressed. He's given me anti anxiety medicine which I haven't taken.\n\nIm only 26, this constant fear of feeling that o have some serious illness is scary. \nCan GERD cause all of the above?",

This should be pinned so people visiting the subreddit for the first time would know where to start with all their questions. \n\nI would add some form of probiotics on the list. Most people with GERD have a damaged stomach lining and the PPI’s could mess with your digestive system so the probiotics just help your body out a little more. It’s been helping me at least. \n\nChew your food thoroughly and take your time eating, it will help your body digests food better and can help prevent heartburn. \n\nEating bananas before breakfast or any meal helps “lubricate” the throat and esophagus and it’s alkaline aka one of the few fruits that aren’t acidic. \n\nFiber supplements or just eating more healthy greens in general. Since i was diagnosed with GERD and taking PPI’s I’ve been constipated and the extra fiber really helps. \n\nA lot of people tend to agree with trying to avoid drinking liquids during a meal, if possible try waiting 10 minutes after you’ve finished a meal to drink liquids in large gulps.",

    "body": "Most of the products I use are K-beauty. I got really into them about a year ago and my skin has never been better! Granted, I still use some western products but that’s so far limited to my retinoid (adapalene gel 0,1%) and my face oil (hempseed oil). My morning and evening routine are typically similar with a few exceptions.\nI also cycle adapalene and the exfoliant. I designated Sunday as a rest day for some reason lol. When I remember to, I use the cicaplast baume at night on Sunday. The last pic is my current skin. Pic was taken a day before this post☺️🫰🏽\n\nMorning routine \nCleanse>treat>protect\nCelimax cleanser\nMugwort essence as toner\nMelano cc to treat pigmentation (the only thing I struggle with now😩)\nCelimax pore dark spot serum is a very recent purchase (I have medium expectations)\nBOJ eye serum is love in an eye cream! (J’adore)\nThe isntree exfoliating moisturiser with 5% PHA is great (I’ve been skipping straight to sunscreen lately tho)\nBOJ relief sun rice probiotics sunscreen is of course my final step et voila!\n\nComments:\nThe cleanser is great and truly does balance skin pH. I just don’t get why it has so many potentially irritating ingredients. After I use it, my skin feels baby soft, but it contains lavender oil, bergamot oil, limonene and a lot of fragrant ingredients! I didn’t notice this before I made the purchase tbh. Luckily, i’m not sensitive to fragrance for now at least so no complaints, but I think i’ll try a different cleanser (also low pH) once this runs out. It’s so economical tho, it’s crazy😂\n\nMelano CC: It works but slowly and steadily! It took a while to notice. I actually thought it wasn’t doing anything initially. Now i’ve added txa from the dark spot serum, I hope things will speed up a bit. It works though and is not at all irritating so I still recommend.\n\nMy night routine is the same plus a few other calming serums like the PKL calming moisture serum and the snail mucin from Cosrx(lovee this one btw). I also double cleanse with an oil cleanser from hadalabo followed by the celimax one. Depending on the day of the week, I either exfoliate or use my retinoid, but never both on the same night! The final step is the face oil which I acknowledge isn't technically necessary, but I love it so much😭 so yea. \n\nHopefully this post helps someone. As you can probably see, I am a man with skin of colour😂. not the usual AB consumer you see everyday, but yea. I fully believe asian beauty especially K-beauty products are miles ahead of what the west offers. I'd happily answer any questions you might have☺️🩵",

    "body": "This is a continuation of the education pieces I've been posting recently. If you missed them here are the first two:\n\n* [An Example of how Commercial Fragrances are Composed](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/bb3crf/a_example_of_how_commercial_fragrances_are/)\n* [Notes on Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/bbw310/notes_on_notes_education_long/)\n\nEveryone seems to have a fragrance they love that just doesn’t last. I see online posts all over the place expressing dismay and even anger about how short lived certain fragrances are (“If I pay $200 for a fragrance, it should last all day!”)\n\nThere are an awful lot of ideas about the reasons for why fragrances last as long (or as short) as they do: EdPs last longer than EdTs. God forbid you get an EdC! That smell will be gone before you’re out the door!  I see people saying that higher quality, more expensive fragrances with lots of naturals will last longer. I also see people saying that you have to go with synthetics in order to get good longevity.\n\nIt’s both more simple and more complicated than most people think.\n\nLet’s take few step  back. You smell a fragrance because molecules of it have evaporated into the air and are floating around. When you inhale, the fragrance molecules get sucked into your nose and bump against your scent receptors. The scent receptors send information to your brain about what you’re smelling and, voila! You can smell the bread baking in the kitchen.\n\nThese scent receptors aren’t infinitely sensitive. There has to be a certain concentration of a material in order for your olfactory receptors to register it and for your brain to interpret it as a smell.  That concentration is called the “threshold of detection” and it’s measured in parts per million/billion/trillion. The threshold of detection is different for different materials, often several orders of magnitude different. Geosmin, one of the molecules responsible for petrichor (the after-the-rain smell) is detectable in parts per trillion. A single drop of it in a kilo of fragrance concentrate leaves a prominent smell.\n\nBeyond the threshold of detection is the threshold of identification. This is the concentration at which you can not only determine that there’s something is present, you can identify what it is.\n\nSo one could describe the longevity of a fragrance in technical terms as being the amount of time that some part of it remains in the air in a concentration that exceeds its threshold of detection.\n\nThe second important factor in longevity is the evaporation rate of a particular material, which is determined by the vapor pressure. I mentioned Geosmin earlier as being a material that humans are incredibly sensitive to, but it doesn’t last a long time in fragrances because it evaporates and disperses very quickly. \n\nThe longest lasting materials are the ones that evaporate slowly and that people are good at smelling.\n\nTypically larger molecules evaporate more slowly than smaller molecules. Musks, for example, are very large molecules. On paper test strips, they can last for weeks.\n\nLimonene, on the other hand, is smaller. It evaporates much more quickly, only lasting a few hours on paper.\n\nThere are other factors that affect evaporation rates as well. For example some molecules stick together more than others, making them slower to evaporate. Often the presence of larger molecules slows down the evaporation rate of other, lighter molecules as well. This is what people are referring to when they say that a material is a fixative. Perfumers will quite often use small amounts of materials that are good fixatives, just for this effect (iso E Super and white musks, for example).\n\nHeat is another factor. As a material heats up, it evaporates more quickly. This is why a fragrance that’s seems perfect in cooler weather can seem powerful enough to be cloying as temperatures rise.\n\nSurface area exposed to air is another. A narrow necked bottle with a liter of water in it will evaporate more slowly than a liter of water spread out on the ground in a thin layer. This is one of the reasons that most fragrances have atomizers. A spritz from an atomizer spreads the fragrance out in a nice thin layer over a large area, maximizing the surface area.\n\nFinally, the amount present affects longevity. A drop of water will generally evaporate more quickly than a liter.\n\nI could write much more on this topic (and might at some point in the future), but this should be enough to allow for a discussion about longevity.\n\nOh, actually, there’s one other related topic that doesn’t explicitly affect longevity, but is important to understanding the behavior of a fragrance as it evaporates.\n\nIf you double the concentration of limonene molecules hitting your olfactory receptors, does that make the limonene smell twice as strong? It turns out that it doesn’t. Every material has a different “slope,” or the rate at which perceived intensity increases as concentration increases. The average is somewhere around 1.2. \n\nIn other words, when you double the concentration of a material, it only smells 1.2x as strong, not 2x as strong. This meant that in order to double the perceived intensity of most materials, you’re looking at increasing the concentration by closer to 10x than 2x.\n\nSome materials have an even lower slope than that. When you combine a low slope and a slow evaporation rate, you end up with a  material that seems to have a relatively consistent strength over a long period of time...it doesn’t start out strong and then get weaker quickly. Instead it will often seem to become more prominent over time as the more powerful (but shorter lived) materials burn off. Musks are a good example of this.\n\nSo now, after reading all of this, you should have the understanding needed to discuss fragrance longevity in more practical terms.\n\nThe concentration of a fragrance (the amount of fragrance base in carrier) matters much less than the composition of the fragrance. I’m not go into great detail into the differences between Eau de Cologne, Eau de Toilette, Eau de Parfum and Parfum in this post, but I will point out that the difference between them is not always just the concentration. Quite often, the formula changes as well. When the EdP version lasts a lot longer than the EdT, that’s more likely the result of difference in formulation than it is a difference in concentration.\n\nI often say that concentration is nowhere near as important as people think it is when it comes to longevity. I always get strange looks when I say so because i’m directly contradicting common Internet wisdom. Think about it though:\n\nThe entire reason that alcohol is used as a carrier is that it allows for a fine mist of fragrance oils to be dispersed across the skin...and then it evaporates.\n\nI talked about vapor pressure earlier. Ambrettolide, a very long lasting base note, has a vapor pressure of 0.00016. It lasts on skin for several hours. Linalool, a top note, has a vapor pressure of 0.016. It lasts on skin for about an hour. Ethanol has a vapor pressure of 55 (mmhg@25C, not Kpa). It lasts for a minute or two, then it’s gone.\n\nThere are math equations that you can do to calculate how long it’s going to be before all that ethanol that’s gone. Within a couple minutes it’s just gone.\n\nGo ahead and spray fragrance on your skin. You can watch the ethanol evaporate. \n\nOnce it’s gone, the fragrance you just sprayed on is now at 100% concentration, regardless of whether it started out at 5%, 10%, 15% or 100% when it was in the bottle. \n\nIf you have a bottle of a particular fragrance at 20% and another bottle of the exact same formula at 10% and you do one spray of the first and two of the second over the exact same area, after 5 minutes the fragrance applied will be pretty much the same. \n\nThe amount of ethanol that used to be in a fragrance, back when it came out of the bottle 8 hours ago does not in any way affect the behavior of the pure materials left on your skin 8 hours later. \n\nSo what does?\n\nThe composition of the fragrance. Fragrances with low vapor pressure, low threshold of detection materials will last the longest\nHow much fragrance base you apply (I.e the amount left after the alcohol evaporates). Two sprays of a 10% fragrance will apply more material than one spray of a 15% fragrance. Also, atomizer volume (the amount of material sprayed out in each spray) can affect this.\nOlfactory fatigue.\n\nWe haven’t talked about olfactory fatigue yet. When you constantly smell a smell, you get used to it. Your brain starts to edit it out. You stop smelling it. \n\nSome materials cause olfactory fatigue more quickly than others. And some materials are found all over the place, like, say laundry products. A lot of people are walking around in a constant haze of olfactory fatigue to certain materials. \n\nIt turns out that the laundry industry snatches up just about every material that smells fresh and can survive 45 minutes in hot soapy water followed by an hour in a hot dryer. A lot of people spend 24 hours/day, 7 days a week with cloth that’s soaked in fragrant materials less than a foot away from their nose and then they’re puzzled because a fragrance that’s supposed to last for 8 hours fades after 2, because they already had olfactory fatigue to half the materials that make up the drydown.\n\nAlso, to be frank, a lot of these materials are fairly subtle smelling and a lot of people who do smell them may not even recognize them as being part of that citrus/lavender/geranium melange that they applied several hours ago.\n\nI’ve noticed that the fragrances that are perceived as lasting the longest often tend to get their longevity from materials that people don’t have as much olfactory fatigue to due to laundry products, e.g. vanilla or oud.\n\n**Appendix with some notes:**\n\n**On reformulations with shorter longevity:**\n\nI’ve seen GCMS readouts from a good number of famous, modern fragrance. Without a single exception, every modern fragrance for which i’ve seen a GCMS, from Aventus to Sauvage to Coco Madmoiselle to Eternity has buckets of iso e super, white musks of various sorts and ambroxan. They’re relatively cheap, powerful and pleasant. They’re practically used as a filler. They also last a very, very long time.\n\nI regularly see claims that a supposedly reformulated version of a particular fragrance “smells the same buy only lasts for a couple of hours.” Reformulation paranoia is another subject that i’ll likely touch on later, but even if the fragrance WAS reformulated, quite often the longest lasting ingredients are some of the cheapest. IFRA changes are also often cited as reasons for these supposed reformulations that kill longevity, but these cheap, long lasting materials are generally allowed at very high levels by IFRA. By “very high,” I mean that they could make up 100% of the fragrance base without running afoul of IFRA regulations. \n\nTo be honest, I don’t know where these claims come from, though I have a few suspicions.\n\n**On carriers other than alcohol:**\n\nIf you’re using a fragrance that uses an oil based carrier like fractionated coconut oil, or an oil-like carrier like jojoba, the carrier doesn’t evaporate right away. Instead it stays behind and acts as a fixative. You’ll likely get better longevity but a more muted odor.\n\n**On using Iso E Super to make fragrances last longer:**\n\nYour fragrance is probably already drenched in Iso E Super. It’s a really, really inexpensive material. The perfumer didn’t add more of it for a reason. When you use too much it can make everything else smell flat and muted. Will it make the fragrance last longer? Maybe, but not that much longer. There’s already probably enough in there to get a good fixative effect.\n\n**On whether natural materials last longer than synthetics:**\n\nSome naturals last a long time. Most of the time, we can synthesize most of the molecules that make up these materials in a lab. Synthetics can also include all sorts of other stuff too though. I can think of materials for which the natural version smells better (deeper/richer/more complex), but I can’t think of any where the natural outlasts the synthetic. I can, however, think of plenty of materials for which there is a longer lasting synthetic version.\n\nThe type of fragrance being made (e.g. a heavy oriental vs. a citrus floral) typically has a lot more to do with longevity than whether it’s made mostly from synthetics or naturals, but if you’re using both you have a wider palette to work from and more choices for long lasting materials at each step along the way.",

I'm asking because it's much easier for me to get to know the transitions of the fragrance on paper.\n2. Some claim that some fragrances gain longevity once you \"let the juice breathe\", as they say, meaning once you spend some of it and the air in the bottle does something to it.

Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

It's apparently been reformulated after the whole Purito fiasco and now it's SPF46 PA+++ which I won't complain about given the quantity and its main purpose for me-  indoors on face and on the body when going outdoors.\n\nI have used this as my sole product in my AM routine, have also tried layering it in with my usual products and also as a base for light makeup. This product is such a delight! It has a beautiful light-weight texture and blends in seconds. It's true to its name-\" fresh\" because this is literally what my skin feels like when I use it.  Those with dry skin and combination skin will love this. It might appear a tad bit dewy on those with oily skin. Despite how comfortable it is to wear as a face sunscreen, I wouldn't say that I prefer it over my HGs Nivea water gel and Skin Aqua (hold cap).\n\nI think it's worthwhile to give it a try esp as a body sunscreen. Overall, this was one of my better impulse purchases.",

It's apparently been reformulated after the whole Purito fiasco and now it's SPF46 PA+++ which I won't complain about given the quantity and its main purpose for me-  indoors on face and on the body when going outdoors.\n\nI have used this as my sole product in my AM routine, have also tried layering it in with my usual products and also as a base for light makeup. This product is such a delight! It has a beautiful light-weight texture and blends in seconds. It's true to its name-\" fresh\" because this is literally what my skin feels like when I use it.  Those with dry skin and combination skin will love this. It might appear a tad bit dewy on those with oily skin. Despite how comfortable it is to wear as a face sunscreen, I wouldn't say that I prefer it over my HGs Nivea water gel and Skin Aqua (hold cap).\n\nI think it's worthwhile to give it a try esp as a body sunscreen. Overall, this was one of my better impulse purchases.\n\n\n[finish of the sunscreen after 30 mins of application ](https://i.imgur.com/NgbZ9SJ.jpg)",

    "body": "ETA: I am NOT advocating trying these methods without consulting a medical professional. PLEASE SPEAK WITH A PROFESSIONAL FIRST. This is important because a) what you think is hormonal acne may not be hormonal acne, in which case an androgen inhibitor can mess you up, and b) there may be an underlying cause for your hormonal imbalance that needs to be addressed. Thanks to /u/satisphoria for suggesting this edit. Please please do not try things that can mess with your hormones without talking to a doctor first. \n\nI've been seeing lots of posts lately asking for hormonal acne help (and I myself am a hormonal acne sufferer!), so I decided to do some research tonight. \n\n**Causes of hormonal acne**\n\nFor those who haven't done the research yet, read here! Others feel free to skip on to the next section.\n\nAccording to [the American Academy of Dermatology](https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/hormonal-factors-key-to-understanding-acne-in-women), hormones influence excess sebum production (yech). This means that skin cells that shred can become \"abnormally sticky\" and clog up your hair follicles. That explains a lot to me (like why the \"beard\" area tends to be a prime place for hormonal acne to pop up). There can also be an excess of the *P. Acnes* bacteria being produced, and skin inflammation can increase. \n\nTo dive deeper into this, the source says that androgens play a role in this by overstimulating the oil glands. So what exactly are androgens, and why on earth do they do these nasty things to our skin?\n\n**Androgens**\n\nThere are two main androgens we should be concerned with here. I found a sample from a [lovely article on PubMed](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0625.2004.00255.x/epdf?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_referrer=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER) that tells me they are called dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S from now on because goddang if that isn't a keyboardful) and androstenedione. The first thing that stands out to me, even just looking at the names, is that one of them is a sulfate. I remember that in the last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4pr2yz/hormonal_outbreak_how_do_you_change_your_routine/) I saw on hormonal acne, /u/zhene said that a sulfate-free toothpaste was helpful when managing hormonal outbreaks. Of course, YMMV applies here, but my brain immediately lightbulbed. Reading further down the PubMed article, I see why: \"DHEA-S is the androgen with by far the highest serum concentration in both sexes and is considered to be the most important regulator of sebum secretion\". Of course, my sample chops off after that point, but hey, that was useful. Connecting these two sources together, it seems as though DHEA-S could be the culprit of the overproduction of sebum and thus the acne. A factoid that I found: [this article](http://www.whitelotusclinic.ca/blog/dr-fiona-nd/high_dhea_testosterone_pcos/) says that a higher level of DHEA-S is one of the markers for PCOS. As I'm sure many of you know, one of the symptoms of PCOS (among others such as hirsutism and the string of pearls cysts on the ovaries) is hormonal acne. \n\nSo what I'm getting out of this: to help control your hormonal acne, you really need to have something that will control/inhibit the production of DHEA-S in particular, or something that's REALLY REALLY GOOD at controlling excess sebum production.\n\n**Spearmint**\n\nThe first thing I thought I'd look into was spearmint. Lots of people swear by spearmint tea or spearmint capsules when they give advice on hormonal acne. However, I am the absolute worst. Translation: I hate drinking tea and taking pills. So I thought, what about using spearmint topically? Here's what I found out:\n\nI got some information from [Essential Oil Informer](http://essentialoilsinformer.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-spearmint-oil/). It uses some credible sources to back up its claims, like the Journal of Microbiology Research, so I'm inclined to say that this particular article is reliable. I did sleuth that journal to back up the claims they are making, and they're all in an [article I found there](http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.microbiology.20110101.01.html). \n\nIt looks like the components of spearmint essential oil are \"Alpha Pinene, Beta Pinene, Carvone, Cineole, Caryophyllene, Linalool, Limonene, Menthol and Myrcene\". I'm over here like, mmm, menthol. Sounds cooling and soothing. Sounds promising-ish. Next up, the bacteria it is useful in combating: \"Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Pasturella multocida\". The fungal pathogens it's useful in combating: \"Aspergillus niger, Mucor mucedo, Fusarium solani, Botryodiplodia theobromae, and Rhizopus solani\". \n\nSo this is lovely. The articles I found say that the \"active\" components of spearmint oil are the carvone and limonene. These would then be the things that have anti-androgenic qualities, if spearmint can be proven to really be anti-androgenic. There have been studies, of course, which point in that direction (namely [one in Turkey](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17310494)), but they don't really seem to come to the conclusion that spearmint is definitely anti-androgenic - only that it might be.\n\nSo that's all well and good, but all these studies are conducted with people actually ingesting spearmint, usually through tea or capsules. But for those who don't want to ingest it, can you use it topically? My research was pretty inconclusive. The most I was able to find was a thread on a message board for PCOS where someone tried [rubbing spearmint tea leaves on their chest](http://www.soulcysters.net/showthread.php/291429-spearmint-tea-experimental!) (you'll have to scroll down a bit or ctrl+f for \"topical\" to find the start of the comments about it) and then rubbing the spearmint essential oil on their chest afterwards (OH MY GOD NONONONO) to see if it helped. They did say that the hairs on their chest lightened and some that were plucked did not grow back, and thankfully discontinued rubbing the essential oil straight on their skin and went back to the tea leaves. Yikes. Speaking of which, obviously you shouldn't go rub this oil right on your skin. Much like tea tree oil, it's much too strong to use straight, you should use a carrier oil if you want to put it on your skin.\n\nIn conclusion: can spearmint essential oil be used topically to help combat your hormonal acne? The answer seems to be a resounding maybe. Since DHEA-S is produced in the adrenal glands and synthesized in the skin, I'm not sure if a topical application of spearmint oil would be \"too late\" to really block the androgen and therefore stop it from messing with sebum production when it's overproduced.\n\n**Evening Primrose Oil**\n\nOkay, y'all still with me? I know that was a pretty long rant on spearmint to end up with \"idk lol\" but I at least feel like I've got a better understanding of where it needs to be working now.\n\nSo, on to evening primrose oil. It can have [some side effects](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/eveningprimrose#cautions) when you ingest it, though this article says that many people tolerate it well in the short term. But we're talking topical here!\n\nThe first thing that jumped out to me as an \"oh hell no\" about using this stuff topically is that it goes rancid REALLY quickly, even when refrigerated. Almost every article I opened up about the stuff basically says \"not worth it, it goes rancid fast.\" However, according to Truth in Aging, it does seem to [dilute sebum production](https://www.truthinaging.com/review/what-is-it-evening-primrose-oil), which is totally what we're going for. Apparently it goes rancid quickly due to its high concentration of saturated fats. So, while it seems like it is possible to treat acne through topical use of evening primrose oil, it's much less practical than taking supplements, and you need to be careful to make sure that there's enough of a concentration of the oil to be effective.\n\nMy rant on evening primrose oil is a bit shorter than the rant on spearmint oil. I'd like to confine myself to \"is this stuff effective topically\" here just to keep the post to a reasonable length. (Actually what is reasonable though, this got way longer than I thought it was going to.) I wanted to include lots more research on how I got to my \"conclusion\" on topical spearmint oil so that I could show that I researched the crap out of it and still found very little that was conclusive. Plus I had to do a lot more piecing together of sources on spearmint than on evening primrose. \n\n**TL;DR:** Topical spearmint oil is a maybe. It's a real androgen blocker, so by the time the androgens actually get to your skin, it may be too late for the spearmint to actually block it. Topical evening primrose oil is a preference. It dilutes sebum instead of blocking androgens, so it's plausible to use it topically, but it goes rancid pretty fast. It may be more plausible to take it as a supplement, but for those who can't/don't want to take pills, you can use the oil on your skin if you're okay with the oil itself dying pretty quickly.\n\nHope this was useful to some people!",

        "body": "I'm really sorry, but this post is a mess.\n\n* Essential Oil Informer is a clickbait site that copies-and-pastes its articles from the sort of sources that think you can cure cancer with magical crystals. It is not a trustworthy medical source.\n\n* Truth in Aging is a commercial site, and its information is all geared towards selling you \"anti-aging\" products. It is also not a trustworthy medical source.\n\n* The OP wrote a section on \"what exactly are androgens\" without actually explaining what they were. Androgens, which include testosterone, are what we call \"male hormones,\" in the same way that we call estrogens \"female hormones.\" It's more complicated than that, since (for one thing) everyone needs to have a balance of both, but in general if you have more androgens than estrogens in your system, you're probably a dude, and if more estrogens, vice-versa.\n\n* PCOS, the most common cause of chronic hormonal acne in adults, is basically when you have ovaries but they're not working right, and you have higher androgen levels than you should. (Not necessarily lower estrogen levels; they might be low, or they might be normal, or high.) People with PCOS often have acne that's most heavy along the jawline, where a beard would grow. Depending on the severity of the hormonal imbalance and how long it persists, you may also grow an actual beard, as well as unusually heavy hair elsewhere on your body. Irregular and unusually painful periods are also common, as are weight gain, diabetes, depression, fatigue, infertility, random stabby pelvic pain, and assorted unpleasant vagina problems like vaginismus or a microperforate/imperforate hymen. (The easiest way to explain the symptoms of PCOS is: imagine if your body can't decide if you're pregnant, or a 16-year-old boy.)\n\n* (Despite what some people think, infertility is not a constant here - it's a common symptom, yeah, but most people with PCOS are able to become pregnant without medical intervention. Having conceived easily doesn't mean that you can't have PCOS, and having PCOS doesn't mean that you don't need birth control.)\n\n* The surfactant-type cleansing sulfates found in toothpaste have literally nothing to do with DHEA-S. The fact that \"sulfate\" is in the name of both is irrelevant: they're totally unrelated substances. \"Zinc oxide\" and \"nitrous oxide\" both end with \"oxide,\" but most physicians advise against using laughing gas as a sunscreen, or Banana Boat as an anesthetic.\n\n* People with PCOS tend to have higher-than-average levels of DHEA-S because DHEA-S is an androgen, and, like I said before, we have elevated androgen levels. Elevated androgen levels cannot be lowered by avoiding sulfate surfactants. If they could, my symptoms would have improved back when I was being a mega-hippie and using baking soda and vinegar for everything.\n\n* Some people do get skin problems from products with sulfates, but that's not a hormone thing. Surfactant-type sulfates are, y'know, surfactants, and surfactants are irritating in general; plus, some people are sensitive to specific sulfates. This is not an under-studied phenomenon.\n\n* Also, sulfate-free toothpastes often have less fluoride than other varieties, and fluoride itself can be irritating to people with sensitive skin or gums. So, the sulfates may not even be what was bothering the particular Reddit user upon whom the OP chose to base the \"sulfates mess up your hormones\" hypothesis.\n\n* Hormonal imbalances are very, very complicated. Trying to find one single hormone to blame for your problems makes as much sense as trying to find one single guy to blame for the crime rate in Florida. Which is to say that it makes no sense. Florida Man is not a real person. I'm sorry; I hope you didn't pay too much for that autograph?\n\n* Whether or not spearmint oil has any antibacterial effects is irrelevant to its usefulness as an androgen blocker, because hormones are not bacteria.\n\n* \"The articles I found say that the \"active\" components of spearmint oil are the carvone and limonene. These would then be the things that have anti-androgenic qualities, if spearmint can be proven to really be anti-androgenic.\" This is 1) not what \"active\" means and 2) completely false. We have no idea yet what substance-or-group-of-substances in spearmint seems to be acting as an androgen blocker.\n\n* It's unlikely to be limonene, though, given that someone would probbbbbbably have noticed by now if literally all citrus fruits were potent androgen blockers.\n\n* \"News At Six: Oranges Cause Impotence And Infertility In Men, Dang How Did Humanity Fail To Notice This For Thousands Of Years\"\n\n* There have in been no long-term studies on the safety of consuming large quantities of spearmint daily. For all we know some combination of ingredients in spearmint will gradually cause liver damage, if permitted to build up. Menthol can definitely be toxic in high enough concentrations; hypothetically, suppose that something else in there kept it from metabolizing, allowing it to build up to a toxic dose?\n\n* If this seems unlikely, keep in mind that black pepper and grapefruit contain ingredients capable of doing this to a number of relatively innocuous medications. I've personally made myself pretty sick with black pepper extract! Fun times.\n\n* Even aside from the lack of toxicity data, we *already know* that taking large doses of spearmint regularly can be dangerous: something in it is a strong diuretic, which means that it can make you dehydrated, make your blood pressure drop sharply, and potentially cause you to pass out. (It seems plausible to me that this something is the same thing that seems to be acting as an androgen blocker; the most popular androgen-blocking medication for PCOS, spironolactone, is also a strong diuretic, and it tastes like spearmint.)\n\n* When you're taking a normal diuretic like spiro, you can compensate by drinking more water and eating more salt and/or sugar. You won't necessarily be able to compensate *easily,* because for a lot of people (including me) it takes substantial effort, but it's at least possible. But because spearmint supplements are not standardized to keep the amount of this diuretic ingredient the same in each pill/teabag/dropperful, you never know how much of it you're getting, meaning that you never know how much water/salt/sugar you need to compensate with to stay safe. You might be fine for the course of one bottle of capsules, then get a new bottle from the same manufacturer and pass out driving to work.\n\n* If a plant has the same effects as a prescription medication, and you're wary the prescription medication, you should always be even more wary of the plant. You know what's in the pill because it's on the label. Plants, however, do not have ingredients lists - their chemical composition varies with the varietal, the weather, the soil, the water and air quality, and dozens of other factors.\n\n* If you think that you have a hormone imbalance, please talk to a doctor if you can possibly do so.",

For women there are several hormones that control fertility and by focusing on one of them i.e. by drinking spearmint tea, it can actually end up knocking other hormones out of balance making the problem worse. (Not a very scientific explanation but you get the point). Hormonal acne is a b!tch and is still not properly understood due to a lack of research/evidence in this area. As a result a lot of doctors and derms still tend to use the retinoid/birth control approach which I don't think actually addresses the root cause of the hormonal imbalance. I suspect lack of research is due to lack of funding if the big drug companies can't make any money out of it!",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "(Cross-posted from r/FODMAPS)\n\nI've been symptom-free for a year, so it's time to tentatively post a success story.\n\nWhen I contracted SIBO, I was forced to radically improve my lifestyle. The process took four years, but now I can happily eat the occasional high-FODMAP meal with no negative consequences. I still have erratic gut motility and need to live a healthy life, but I'm free of the misery, malnutrition, constipation and inflammation.\n\nThere wasn't a single magic bullet for me, although a few supplements really helped. These were the steps I took to fix my SIBO:\n\n1. I found an elimination diet (keto) that allowed me to be temporarily symptom-free. The low-FODMAP diet actually didn't help me: I suspect that it worsened my dysbiosis due to the lack of healthy fibers. Getting symptom-free was the only way to start isolating root causes.\n2. I worked on my overall nutrition using Cronometer. I tracked my macros and micros for a month, then started beefing up my nutrition until I was in the green for protein, healthy fat, and nutrients. This required...\n3. ...A big lifestyle shift. Drastically cutting back on alcohol, getting tons more sleep, exercising daily, and cutting my sugar intake to near-zero. This was hard for a while, and now it's easy. I feel like an athlete most days, and a few years ago I just wanted to die.\n4. Reintroducing non-keto foods and monitoring the results. At this point, I finally started figuring out my underlying cause: I had low stomach acid, which allowed bacteria to collect in my stomach and enter my small intestine, causing bloating, inflammation, and mixed diarrhea and constipation.\n5. On the suggestion of TC Hale (a great YouTube resouce for IBS), I did a three-week course of D-Limonene first thing in the morning. This cleared out my stomach.\n6. I then started improving my digestion using supplements. I added Betaine HCL capsules to each meal in order to increase my stomach acid, plus a broad-spectrum digestive enzyme. I still do this, as well as ox bile last thing at night and TUDCA to improve my bile flow.\n7. Finally, and very importantly, I began to reintroduce small but diverse sources of fiber into my diet. Not enough to clog up my recovering intestines, but enough to provide food for diverse beneficial bacteria.\n\nI'm feeling great now. My mental health is night-and-day. If I have a week of garbage eating then I'll notice the old problems creeping back, but they go away as soon as I switch back to a healthy diet. For reference, I have an egg bowl in the morning, a nutritious smoothie for lunch, and a hearty dinner with lots of vegetables. I also eat one or two indulgent meals per week, and I've never felt better.",

The intrusive thoughts are horrible and not to mention the brain fog that keeps me confused. I used to drink wine everyday and I think that was the root cause. I quit almost 3 months ago and have gotten better but the constant bloating looking 9 months pregnant has not gone away, maybe I look 7 months now but still there. My mental health symptoms have improved but I still feel that I’m not ok, I constantly crave sweets that I didn’t before (before I quit drinking) and that is holding me back. Keto works for me but it’s been a struggle to keep up without sugar. I’ll definitely give your steps a try and hope to get out of this mental agony I’ve been. It’s insane how gut health affects mental health so bad. Congrats on getting better, look forward to the same. Thank you!",

Pylori much sooner and allowed targeted treatment - and most of all, as it is as this stage, Pylori will still be in there draining resources and requiring this routine to manage it - and all it can take is one more health episode - a virus, grief, etc, for the thing to become dominant again.  \n\nAgain I am not 100% online diagnositng H. Pylori.  \nIt does strongly fit this picture - but more important is the total apparent lack of data driven testing to confirm any of this.

I have combo oily skin that's acne prone, has some unevenness, and have dryness on the cheeks and below the eyes.](https://preview.redd.it/wjk1a59hwu9a1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e42445669ae6474aec27e18314faddba3c9ddf)\n\nWill RP: \n\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 5/5** I get compliments routinely if someone sees me within a few hours after application. I gave a bottle to my grandma who said, \"It works after one time. What kind of a thing is that?\" You just glow. This being said, I have thought about Silymarin or Phloretin instead since I have prone to acne but haven't yet. I use every morning.\n* **SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore: 4/5** This is one of the best moisturizers ever, with the only 3 things working against it being: A) it's pretty low on the humectant side of the moisturizing house and pretty high on the emollient side (which is fine but can feel a bit waxy), B) it has some essential oils and linalool or limonene I believe, which make it slightly irritating (which I can handle but others may not), and C) it's expensive ($136). It's restorative and truly repairs the skin barrier in a visible way. Excellent for skin that's dry or irritated (provided you can handle the essential oils).\n* **SkinCeuticals Emollience: 5/5** I prefer this to Triple Lipid (although it has a slightly different function and character: TLR is like an expensive suit and Emollience is like a well made linen outfit. TLR is excellent but extra; Emollience is versatile but timeless). It feels more quenching to the skin than TLR (more humectant properties). I love the algae extract, too. Plus, it's \\~1/2 the price of TLR.\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleanser: 4.5/5** I love the menthol and the feeling it creates (cooling). I think the LHA also works well to clear my pores and sebaceous filaments but hard to tell with a cleanser. If you're sensitive, menthol could be an issue. It's not super expensive (\\~$45). I use this whenever I'm not going to be putting retinoid on my face immediately after.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced + Serum 5/5:** Thought long and hard about this one as it's almost double the price of anything else in the cabinet ($295 -- altho $230 if you subscribe and cancel if needed) and it's really marketed for anti-aging market (I'm 26yo male), but jesus christ this stuff is magic. I noticed a tightening of the skin within less than a day after starting to use it. Noticeably reduced fine lines (yes, I have some). I use this after dermarolling .25mm in the shower (as is recommended online by med spas etc). I use this on recovery night.\n* **LRP Anthelios Melt in Milk: 4/5** I like the physical/chemical mix. It has a nice feeling on the face (cooling) and isn't too thick. It works and feels good. I can get away with no moisturizer under it on warm days.\n* (Not pictured) **LRP Toleriane Cleanser: 5/5** Extremely gentle and hydrating. I use before retinoid or if the skin is irritated. \n* **Curology (.01% tretinoin + 2% azaelic + 4% niacinamide): 4/5**: Easy and I like the compounding for my skin type. I will ask to increase tret % soon.\n* **Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel 5/5:** Incredible face feel. Cooling and slick and not at all greasy. If you're on a budget, have combo/oily skin, or want something super sheer for daytime use, this is the HG.\n* **SkinMedica HA5 Rejuvinating Hydrator: 4.5/5** I wouldn't say that the effect is immediate here, but I do notice my skin feeling and looking plumper after using this. It's totally non greasy or tacky (not even the case with the HG above) and has urea, serine, and ferment in addition to the 5 molecular weights of HA. I wish it didn't have algin, which can be comedogenic and irritating. But I haven't found it to be either of those. At $187, the price is the major reason I knocked it down a rung on rating. It's not dramatic enough for that price, IMO, but if you can afford, it's great. There are other supporting incis which are impressive like plankton extract, grape flower cell extract, whey protein, and pullulan (the material that makes Listerine breath strips into their thin film gel). I would definitely say this is a tightening product.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair: 4/5** I really do love this cream so far. A lot of people say it didn't agree with their skin but as someone who's acne prone with Fitzpatrick type III, I think I can handle the eucalyptus in this. Plus it's affordable relatively ($38 for 6oz) but does leave a bit of a white cast.  Shea + Squalane + Allatonin + Licorice Extract + Green Tea Extract = yummy hydration and calming. Feels a bit like Burts Bees Lip Balm as in it's cooling and healing but also feels like it's increasing circulation.\n\nMight RP:\n\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream: 3/5** I like the formulation and face feel here and the price (\\~$40) but some of the ingredients + the results are a bit 🔎 . For starters, I don't know why they use Ascorbyl Palmitate, which has similarly poor stability to ascorbic acid. I also wish they listed the free acid concentration here. I wish no cetyl alcohol either. It's not bad by any means, but I'm curious about other options (isClinical Active Serum -- pls comment if you have experience!) \n* **SkinCeuticals HA Intensifier: 3/5** The proxylane is great and definitely has a good face feel and plumping effect. But the denatured alcohol + the price point + the relatively one dimension of this product (it's p much just HA as opposed to the ultra multitasking HA5) means it's a bit overpriced for what it is ($106) and risky re irritation. Definitely not a no-go but not a favorite for me.\n* **SK-II Pitera Masques: 2/5** @ $16/masque it's just a lot for a single use. If you want to give SK-II Pitera a try, I would get the essence and get 10x the uses. It works for some, others say it breaks them out. I have enough ferment (that's the real key to Pitera) in other products. Obviously not all ferment is the same. Another one to explore besides HA5 would be Estee Lauder ANR.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel: 3/5** I really like this serum and tbh my skin drinks it up but it's just more relevant if you have pretty reactive skin that gets irritated. It's very cooling and delicious but not a necessity in my routine at the moment. Plus, if your skin is that irritated, you might need to tone down the actives rather than patching with this. Plus, there are irritants (ironically): linalool, benzyl benzoate, parfum, etc.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 2/5** Same as above but even less needed (maybe if you just had a peel it's worth it) but they have alcohol denat and citronellol in this one too. Why? It is very cooling though.\n* **SkinCeuticals A.G.E. Eye Complex: 2/5** A bit burning and irritating to my undereye if I use too frequently. Does have nice smoothing and optical effects (reduced purple undereye and dark circles). Maybe I just have sensitive skin on the eye 🤷 \n* **The Ordinary 5% Caffeine + EGCG Depuffing Eye Serum: 3/5** Same as above (can be irritating if you use too much or too often i.e., every day) but works about as well as AGE Eye Complex for a fraction of the price (\\~$10 vs. $100).\n* **The Ordinary 30% AHA 2% BHA: 3/5** I use this for an occasional peel on my body. It works fine, I think, but microneedling or something professional would likely work better. It's fine and cheap.\n\nWon't RP:\n\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser: 2.5/5** I really wish SkinMedica would move away from Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate. It's just harsh on the skin and a bit too stripping as a surfactant. There are plenty of other options, and it's not awful (there are a lot of Neutrogena + L'Oreal products that use it) but not ideal. I also wish there were no essential oils (EOs) in this but there's lavender and citrus. The jojoba beads are kinda nice bc they provide a bit of physical exfoliation but then dissolve and are hydrating. It's not awful by any means but for the price (\\~$50) I'm going to keep looking.\n* **SkinMedica Purifying Foaming Wash: 2/5** Too stripping (b/c of Sodium C14-16 Olefine Sulfonate as above) but also has methylisothiazolinone which is probs going to be banned in Denmark, is sensitizing, only allowed currently in rinse off products, and just why? There are other options.\n* **Vichy Eau Thermal: 2/5** Fine. Nothing special. Just water. Might get a spray bottle instead. At $25 for the full size, it just feels silly \n* **Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate 1/5:** Chock full of EOs. Can be very irritating with almost no benefit you couldn't get from a different product.",

        "body": "Excellent review! I love that you gave CE Ferulic to your Grandma! That is very sweet, and an awesome gift! I think I need to switch too, because it keeps making me break out. \nI had no idea about the Pullulan in Listerine strips! Nobody talks about this ingredient enough. Every time it is in skincare, it makes my forehead so tight it is uncomfortable to me. It definitely seems to have some firming and tightening effects. I noticed it a lot in the Cocokind Ceramide Serum and another serum that I’ve used. I had to stop using both. Here’s what I just found on the web for Pullulan, again no mention of the firming results but it definitely produces! \n\n\n\n\n\nPullulan\nRating: GOOD\nCategories: Antioxidant, Texture Enhancer\nPullulan at a Glance\nVersatile skin care ingredient known for its hydration and antioxidant properties\nWorks well as a “carrier” to deliver active ingredients where they need to go\nHas potential to help strengthen skin’s microbiome\nCan provide temporary mechanical support for skin’s underlying structures\nContinually being studied for its many therapeutic, film-forming benefits for skin\nPullulan Description\nPullulan is a natural fibrous polymer produced by a type of black yeast known as Aureobasidium pullulans. It contains complex sugars known as polysaccharides, which makes it a good water-binding agent (i.e. hydration) and antioxidant in skin care products.\nIt is proven to work well as a “carrier” for other skin care actives, effectively delivering the ingredients where they need to go.\nAdditionally, research shows pullulan has the potential to help with strengthening skin’s microbiome. Studies also show it can provide temporary mechanical support for skin’s underlying structures as well as a subtle yet visible lifting effect owing to its non-irritating film-forming properties\nMore recently, pullulan has been utilized in dissolving microneedle patch products where it is believed to enhance transdermal delivery of ingredients. Scientists are also exploring the therapeutic benefits of pullulan-based hydrogel films for various skin conditions.\nAs a texture-enhancing ingredient, characteristics of pullulan include its water solubility and relatively low viscosity compared to other polysaccharides. It possesses good thermal stability and has earned Generally Recognized as Safe (GRaS) status from U.S. FDA.",

My skin doesn’t get along with fragrance, citrus, or floral essential oils, so I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and a dedicated ingredients list reader. I’m always learning, but I hope these reviews help.      \nI’ll be keeping the reviews short and straight to the point, but if you ever want more detail on a product, just let me know!      \n\n\n**Almost Porefect - 8/10**              \nPaula’s Choice : SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant              *Pros:* Clears out congestion, light fluid texture, noticeably effective.              \n*Cons:* Very strong — easy to overdo it. Smells like straight-up alcohol. Not for sensitive skin.              \n*Bottom line:* Use with caution — twice a month is plenty!                            \n**Soothe Operator - 7/10**              \nBiafine Emulsion              \n*Pros:* Actually relieves pain and Soothes sunburns. Very affordable.              \n*Cons:* Contains a Sodium Alginate and fragrance. Not for everyday use.              \n*Bottom line*: Use with purpose - (Like if you over-exfoliated and then spent too much time in the sun… been there.              \n               \n**French Stripper - 3/10**              Typology: Purifying Cleansing Gel with 2% Zinc PCA + Bamboo Extract.              *Pros:* Smells nice, “clean” formula, love the brand’s ethos.              \n*Cons:* Little stripping and drying, contains eucalyptus oil and limonene.              \n*Bottom line:* Gentle on paper, little harsh on skin. Not for the easily dried out.              \n               \n**Mousse-take - 5/10**              \nVacation: Classic Whip SPF 30 Sunscreen Mousse (whipped cream)              \n*Pros:* Absorbs easily, fun packaging, leaves skin glowy.              \n*Cons:* Messy to use, not face-friendly, only SPF 30, stings the eyes.              \n*Bottom line:* Cute for content but stick to their regular cream sunscreen.              \n               \n**Lactose Tolerant - 9/10**              \nRhode: Glazing Milk ceramide facial essence              \n*Pros:* Hydrating, leaves a beautiful glow, cute packaging.              \n*Cons:* Pricey, slight chemical smell, may have caused a few bumps over time.              \n*For who:* For those who can appreciate a top tier ingredients list and miss the old Laneige toner formula.               \n               \n**Supreme Sting - 8/10**              \nUltra Violette: Supreme Screen SPF 50 Facial Sunscreen Moisturizer and Primer (American version).              \n*Pros:* Love the pump, silky finish, no white cast.              \n*Cons:* Eye sting alert, not good for sweat or water.              *Bottom line:* If you can import the Aussie version, definitely do!              \n               \n**Grainy Funk-3/10**              \nRhode: Peptide Lip Tint (color toast)              *Pros:* Beautiful shade, clever packaging that makes application a breeze, long-lasting hydration.              \n*Cons:* Texture turns grainy over time, and after a couple of months, it develops an unbearable smell.              \n*Bottom line:* So close to being worth the hype but wouldn’t buy again because of how quickly it went bad.              \n               \n**Soulless Suds - 1/10**              \nWalgreens: Hydrating Facial Cleanser              *Pros:* Cheaper than CeraVe.              *Cons:* Drying, over-cleansing, forgettable.               *Bottom line:* Just add a few bucks to your cart and spare your face!              \n              \n**Gloss Angeles - 8/10**                    \nTower 28 : ShineOn Lip Jelly              \n*Pros:* Cute color range, super comfortable (not sticky or tacky), good price.              \n*Cons:* Needs frequent reapplication, scent/taste could use work.              \n*Bottom line:* Doesn’t moisturize much, but for the price?

I'm going to guess that the different smell is also from the way they moved around the amount of rosemary extract.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you!

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it.

    "body": "Having a really hard time finding a sunscreen that meets my demands\n\nFirst of all my skin type: Sensitive, reactive, somewhat acne prone and combination. Generally normal (sometimes a bit dry) on my cheeks and forehead but quite oily on my nose even in the winter. Chin is either normal or slightly oily.\n\nNow onto finding a sunscreen…\n\nMust be:\n\nCruelty free\n\nReef safe\n\nEWG approved\n\nNon-comedogenic (or only a few low comedogenic ingredients. Comedogenic can be subjected so not every so called comedogenic ingredient is going to make everyone break out)\n\nNon-acnegenic (acnegenic and comedogenic are similar but not the same. And of course the same principal above applies).\n\nSafe for fungal acne as I have a tendency to get fungal acne breakouts on my cheeks (a few ingredients that are triggers MIGHT be ok but if there’s a lot of them it probably won’t work. I would really have to try a product out to see how I’ll react)\n\nSilicone free. I know a lot of people will say that silicone doesn’t clog pores but I’ve had a reaction to every single product I’ve had with silicone in it even if none of the other ingredients bother me.\n\nAlcohol free (fatty alcohols are ok)\n\nSLS free\n\nFragrance free. Remember that ‘fragrance’ is an umbrella term used so companies can add in whatever chemicals they want without having to label them. FYI even essential oils in a lot of more ‘natural’ sunscreens can irritate me. Especially citrus ones.\n\nNot full of unnecessary fillers\n\nLightweight, fully absorbable and non-tacky and non-greasy. Something with more of a gel or lotion consistency would be a lot better than your typical sun screen texture.\n\nMust wear well under makeup as I wear liquid foundation (water and aloe based).\n\nIf it contains zinc oxide it must be at least 20% or 15% with 7.5% titanium dioxide\n\nAntioxidants would be nice\n\nPhotostable of course\n\nBulletproof\n\nCures cancer\n\nCosts less than 10 cents wouls be great\n\nEdible (i've experienced hunger before)\n\nShelf life at least a decade (i might tolerate 9 years, i have to try it first)\n\nI was suggested Elta MD UV Clear and the ingredients look ok except it is very low in zinc oxide. I looked up Ren Clean Screen although it has lots of oils in it and being that my skincare and makeup is water based I’m not sure if it would place nice. It also has Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene and Linalool which are considered to be irritating fragrances.\n\nI have Derma E oil free sunscreen but it’s too sticky and does NOT work with liquid foundation. Someone suggested making sure I pat my foundation to blend, not swipe or rub it in. That’s how I apply it with a damp sponge. It’s a bit hard to explain it but it might look ok for a minute or two and then all of a sudden it looks horrible. Like my skin underneath is starting to heat up and dissolve the foundation. It looks splotchy and patchy. If I only use mineral powder it works ok (though I prefer the look and coverage of liquid) but another issue is that this sunscreen causes a lot of sweating (at least for me. It makes my face feel hot) so my face is ultimately going to turn into a greasy mess.\n\nA lot of people suggest Asian or European sunscreens yet I haven't been able to find any so far with ingredients that are suitable. I won't use any sunscreen until all these demands are met! So get those recs in, pores!",

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

    "body": "Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

    "body": "I’m breaking my own rule of not reviewing a strain before trialling it over a few days, because this is out of this world and I want to shout it from the rooftops to all my homies at MCOZ 🌿🙏🏽\n\nI have been super excited for Single Estate’s new brand Munchies Stash to be released, and the Lemon Zkittles has literally smashed all my expectations and for the price is way better than I could have dreamed. Knowing Single Estate’s impeccable and uncompromising standards, I knew this would revolutionise the more budget category by providing outstanding standards. \n\nLemon Zkittlez is 28% THC with 3.81% terps and the dominant terps are caryophyllene, limonene and alpha humulene.\n\nStrain is Lemon Tree x Zowah 🌿\n\nSmall batch ✅ Hang Dried ✅ Slow Cure ✅ \n\nLemon tree is a balanced hybrid cross of lemon skunk and sour diesel which exudes a gorgeous citrus scent with a slight hint of diesel 🍋 ⛽️ \n\nZowah is a hybrid of zkittlez and karma sour diesel producing a heady experience with sweet, sour and tropical flavours 🍭🍬\n\nWith a lot of cannabis cultivation pivoting to Thailand, it’s really interesting assessing the quality for price for these brands now importing from Thailand. \n\nIt comes sealed in a mylar bag that has a really beautiful iridescent tinge. It’s a stroke of genius that the mylar bag is in a box. I hesitate to buy cannabis in pouches because it can get damaged and squashed in transit, this is brilliant as it preserves the cannabis and trichomes in particular. The box comes with a QR code that led to very informative and helpful information about this medicine. \n\nI knew I was in for something special when I could smell a strong delicious scent before even opening the bag. The smell is absolutely heavenly, bursting with fresh zesty citrus and candy tones 🍋🍭\n\nVisually it’s an absolute supermodel. It has very bright green and purple tones, something very rare to see. Bag appeal gets a 10/10. Frosty, fresh and terpy. Grinds up really nicely and has a nice stickiness while not clogging up the grinder. Buds are all medium to large with zero shake 💚\n\n The effects come on strongly with an amazing mental uplift and it’s really super cruisy. Limonene is the most effective and brilliant antidepressant for me. I would describe this as a great uplifting and euphoric clear headed yet at the same time very heady strain.  Recommended also to those who find terpinolene dom sativa strains anxiety producing .  Effects get a 10/10 🏆 \n\nNow let’s talk legs - this has legs for days, another unique and refreshing quality of this banger. The effects last a good 2-3 hours which is incredible and unique. I haven’t experienced such lasting effects from a sativa dom strain. \n\nTake a bow Single Estate, for bringing more unique strains at such great quality and such great prices 🙏🏼🏆🎉👌🌿⭐️\n\n",

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

It's impossible to last without sulphates. Most CG shampoos also have milder sulphates because they're cleansing agents. Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required.

    "body": "We see a lot of posts about cannabis here on r/migraines, I thought I'd make a little super guide for people interested in trying it. As someone who has used cannabis to treat her chronic migraines since she was 15! (I’m 25 now)\n\n(tldr at the end)\n\n———\n\nEdit: commenters have mentioned interactions between medication and cannabis and I think that’s important to note (specifically CGRPs and Lyrica). However it is hard to find conclusive studies on these interactions due to cannabis being illegal federally. It is important to talk to your doctor about using cannabis. \n\nCannabis may not be an option for everyone, and it won’t work for everyone. This is just a guide for IF you’d like to try it and where to begin. If you don’t feel relief, or it makes you feel worse, it just might not be the right option for you and that’s ok! \n\n———\n\n**What type of cannabis should I be looking for?**\n\nType depends on how you'd like to consume cannabis. Vaping and smoking are going to be your fastest way to get relief. This can be done through flower or through concentrates (think of dabs if you know what that is). \n\nMore long term effects are best ingested, such as edibles or tinctures. They take a bit to take effect though, so if I go for an edible perhaps, I will also vape first to get immediate relief. Smoking itself is known to cause headaches, so that's always a risk. I personally prefer vaping CBD full spectrum concentrates, because it’s less harsh than smoke.\n\n**Full spectrum? What is that? Am I supposed to be looking for something specific?**\n\nThere's two routes you can go when choosing products. Primarily THC products or CBD products. THC is the part of cannabis that has a psychoactive effect, so you'll get high. CBD does not have a psychoactive effect. However the two are best used together, as they have a synergistic effect (meaning they work better together than separate).\n\nIf you're not looking to get high, you'll be looking for CBD products. When you're shopping for products, you'll see things like \"broad spectrum\" and \"full spectrum\" and isolates. \n\n*Broad spectrum* means that almost everything that is in the cannabis plant is in your product, except THC. This includes other cannabinoids and terpenes. These products are generally made by adding different components of cannabis together, rather than coming directly from a cannabis plant.\n\nHowever, we know that THC and CBD work best together, so you most likely want to look for *Full Spectrum* products. Full Spectrum products are derived from cannabis and contain THC, but very little. I have personally never experienced a high from full spectrum products, however you may not be able to pass a drug test (I have also heard the same for Broad Spectrum).\n\nThere are also *CBD isolates*, which is pure CBD with no other cannabinoids or terpenes. I personally don't find these helpful, as it's the synergistic relationship between THC and CBD and other cannabinoids and terpenes that I have found the most helpful (and has studies to back that up).\n\n**Cannabinoids? Terpenes? Help.**\n\nWhen we break down a cannabis plant chemically there's other things in there besides CBD and THC. Such as cannabinoids and terpenes. These are important to pay attention to because the specific cannabinoids and terpenes in products can help you choose a product that will most likely work better for you based on their medicinal benefits. \n\nCannabinoids are biological compounds that bind to cannabinoid receptors in your endocannabinoid system. Your endocannabinoid system is a biological system in your body that helps regulate and balance key biological functions, such as neuronal synaptic transmission, how your brain communicates. It also has been shown to have a key role in chronic neuropathic pain, i.e. migraines.\n\nI have seen cannabinoids listed most often in stores where cannabis is regulated. It's shown as a percentage, listed alongside the two main cannabinoids, THC and CBD.\n\nTerpenes are what is responsible for your flavor and aroma in cannabis. They're basically essential oils. However there are studies showing how they interact with the endocannabinoid system and cannabinoid receptors and therefore why they have the certain effects that we see. It's not just aromatherapy, or pseudoscience, as I've seen claimed before. \n\n**But which ones do I choose !!!**\n\nCannabinoids for migraines are going to be anti-inflammatory, because there is evidence of neurogenic inflammation leading up to a migraine. These include primarily:\n\n* CBG: most common in hemp strains (have a low THC percentage), also have an anti-depressant effect but can be an appetite stimulant, so be prepared to have the munchies\n* THCA: also anti-nausea\n* CBC: can make you reaaally sleepy though and it has sedative qualities\n\nalmost all cannabinoids do show anti-inflammatory effects, but the 3 listed above are the strongest in that department. High CBG and CBD I have heard is the most beneficial for migraine people.\n\nTerpenes are what I look for most. These are harder to find on packaging in store fronts. I order my CBD online (it is legal if it has a very tiny percentage of THC) and it is much easier to find specific terpene (and cannabinoid) information for products that way in my experience. Terpenes to look for in treating migraines are:\n\n* beta-caryophyllene: this is big for neuropathic pain (migraines)\n* myrcene: the next big one for migraines, also shows anti-anxiety relief and is commonly known as a \"couch-lock\" because its also a muscle relaxant and sleep aid\n* pinene: also is an antioxidant and potentially helps osteoarthritis! \n* limonene: also an antioxidant, anti-depressant, anti-anxiety\n* linalool: also anti-anxiety/stress, anti-depressant, but will make you sleepy!\n* borneol: helps with sleep too but is common cause of dry mouth and red eyes!\n\nI have also read that eucalyptol, delta-3-carene, and nerolidol are also beneficial terpenes for migraines but above are the main ones\n\n**What if I WANT to get high?**\n\nListen, sometimes the pain is so awful the choice is either be in pain or be high. Being high is far more fun and even if it doesn't completely take away my pain, I am in a much better mood. The day was already wasted, might as well enjoy it and relax.\n\nWhen looking at flower, most indica strains are going to be dominant in beta caryophyllene and myrcene, with the second most dominant terpenes to be limonene or a-pinene. (*however* indica v. sativa is not a great method of choosing because chemically there is no longer a difference between the two. Whether a plant is indica or sativa is chosen by the effect of the user now)\n\nOther studies have shown that hybrid strains are more preferred for migraine and headache. With OG Shark being the most loved from a survey. But I have also heard Trainwreck being a great migraine strain. I personally love AC/DC and Super Silver Haze\n\nStores are much better at listing cannabinoids nowadays than terpenes. But sometimes you can ask a budtender for the extra information of a strain that came from the provider. Going strictly off a strain name can be hard, because it can really depend between providers. You may just have to get a gram and try it out. Keeping a note on your phone about how each strain made you feel is really helpful!\n\n**Can you recommend some stuff?**\n\n[Fields of Hemp](https://fieldsofhempllc.com/) is my favorite place to get CBD flower (high CBD low THC). They include their lab testing sheets in each strain that tells you exactly the percentages of cannabinoids and terpenes. They also have a sampler pack of strains that is cheap and easy to try out different things. \n\nWhen you go into stores there will also be things like 1:1 or 20:1 which explains how much THC to CBD there is in the product. Personally I get the most relief from 1:1 products (an even amount of THC and CBD). I have yet to ever experience a high from these products. Some 1:1 products I really like are Binske and Wylde edibles, Skagit Organics vape cartridges (you need a battery for carts, unlike disposables), and GreenRevolution water solvable tinctures (they taste terrible on their own but you can mix them into drinks). I am in Washington so some of these are specific to my state, except for Wylde which I would highly recommend \n\nMy favorite CBD Full Spectrum concentrate is from Plain Jane, called [Gelato](https://plainjane.com/cbd-concentrates/) (I have heard not great things about their flower but I have never tried it, only the concentrate). It has caryophyllene, d-limonene, linalool, and beta-pinene terpenes. \n\nI vape it using my [PAX vaporizer](https://www.pax.com/vapes/categories/vaporizers). These are pricey ngl. However I have had mine for almost 10 years now. Mine specifically does flower and concentrates, using an oven instead of combustion, which is safer on your lungs and less harsh (though there is not studies done on this, i desperately wish there was, so this is my personal experience). Plus the Gelato concentrate doesn't even smell, I carry it around in my purse and nobody can tell, which is GREAT!\n\n**tldr;**\n\nthe most helpful way to use cannabis for migraines is using products that have *BOTH* THC and CBD, as they work best together. If you don't want to be high, look for Full Spectrum products. Additionally, products that have cannabinoids such as CBG, THCA, and CBC in them will be more helpful. Terpenes that are also helpful in treating migraines are primarily B-caryophyllene, myrcene, pinene, and limonene. Products that have these things in them will be more likely to help you relieve your pain and is a good place to start if you're just trying this for the first time. It does however take time, patience, and money to find something that works for you.\n\n*Sources (just a few I reference the most, highly suggest reading yourself):*\n\nBaron, “Medicinal Properties of Cannabinoids, Terpenes, and Flavonoids in Cannabis, and Benefits in Migraine, Headache, and Pain.” (this one is the most helpful imo)\n\nPoudel et al., “Medical Cannabis, Headaches, and Migraines.”\n\nCox-Georgian et al., “Therapeutic and Medicinal Uses of Terpenes.”\n\nPagano et al., “Cannabinoids.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I have emergency joints on hand for when I get one, I usually smoke and lay down maybe also take a very light Advil and drink a lot of water. Once my vision comes back I feel a lot better it used to take 2 days to feel good again and I feel semi normal in about 2 hours after the weed and I don’t throw up which is the worst part. I also find that smoking THC Vapes don’t help my migraine attacks sometimes make them worse for some reason.",

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

When you smell the peel of a citrus fruit you can think of limonene.\nLimonene is a chiral molecule but the most common (R)-enantiomer is D-limonene which is produced by many citrus fruits. It is commercially obtained by centrifugal separation or steam distillation. Due to its strong scent it functions as a botanical insecticide but cats also find the scent unpleasant. So, if your cats won't leave your plants alone give limonene a try!\n\nIt is also a popular profile terpene in cannabis (ex: Super Lemon Haze, Chernobyl, Berry White).\n\nD-limonene is commonly used as a less toxic substitute to xylene in histology when clearing dehydrated specimens. Clearing agents are solvents compatible (miscible) with alcohols and melted paraffin wax.\n\nIf applied to the skin, it can cause contact dermatitis - it is flammable as a liquid and toxic to aquatic life.\n\n\nIf you're looking to add some zest to your life, try limonene.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Finally I can say I have been lucky enough to try a strain from the famous cookies family which has been created by “Powerzzzup” and selected by the man himself “Berner” ! \n\ncereal milk is a unique cross between “Y-life x Snowman” with the dominant terpenes of limonene, myrcene, caryophyllene and pinene (1.5% - 3%)\n\nI was really excited to open the seal on this tub and I can definitely say I was not disappointed ! First thing I noticed was the absolutely caked out budz that catch the eye instantly, very unique colours to these budz pairing with a sweet candy/cheesecake smell mixed with straight gas !! Absolutely incredible smell which is potent enough to fill the area around you with the beautiful aromas 👌👌 \n\nPersonally these budz are cured to perfection for me, definitely not bone dry and comes with a nice snap to the budz 😆😆 grinds so easy in the brilliant cuts with a nice fluffy texture that I like ! \n\nThis is a balanced hybrid strain but I feel it’s potent enough to lean towards an indica dominant, the effects are really unique ! Definitely euphoric and uplifting as catalyst has displayed, personally this strain absolutely disintegrated my anxiety and at the same time I feel it’s perfect for managing stress and depression! The more I had of this strain the more the effects increased and put me in a mentally and physical relaxed mood that led on to me having a really nice sleep 👌👌 \n\nOverall I highly rate this strain for myself and I urge anyone experiencing anxiety to give this strain a go as it’s the definition of an “anxiety killer” it will surprise you ! I love the recommendations single estate advise for us patients with this strain they believe 20 joints by Berner is a nice song to chill out too and when the munchies kick in to treat yourself to some Knafeh. I have my own recommendations and I always bump too “top down by Berner” and definitely recommend some baklava with this strain as it mixes well with the sweetness of the taste and smell 👌👌\n\n",

(This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

Helps relieve stress and elevates mood.\nCaryophyllene helps protect the brain & nervous system so it is good for relieving anxiety & depression. Also is good for chronic inflammation.\nMyrcene is what’s commonly found in indica strains which not only have sedative effects but is anti inflammatory and antibiotic\nGetting to the root of what I am looking for personally, then finding the terps that best fit what i’m looking for helped me find herbs to mix with my cannabis and also just a better understanding of the cannabis plant and it’s multiple medicinal benefits.",

I’ll always let you know what works for what \n\n^ _ ^\n\nTerpenes are something all plants are about, cannabis just happens to be an unusually insurmountable cocktail of them, within a single plant. The ones you name are the most common, albeit any given strain can have hundreds. \n\nBeta-Myrcene and Beta-Caryophyllene for the win!\n\nI’m surprised so many people know nothing of this, especially in 2020, and, in an herbalism-focused subreddit, at that. \n\nAfter all:\n\nOne must be *a true connoisseur of their interests*, to capitalize off of the good coming from such interests, and as such, make a hobby into an art...otherwise it’s a waste of potential happiness + fulfillment + overall therapy!\n\nThat being shared, when we smoke herbs, cannabis aside, we aren’t only smoking terpenes — also, smoking terpenes can be dangerous at times — the whole phenolic profile must be considered (flavonoid, flavonols, alkaloids, plenty of therapeutic components to note)!",

With increasing interest towards the manifold activities of eCBs, this book discusses the chemical, biochemical, and molecular biological assays, and activity of distinct elements of the ECS. These include membrane, nuclear receptors, biosynthetic and hydrolytic enzymes, and membrane transporters and oxidative enzymes. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls.*\n\n*Timely and cutting edge, Endocannabinoid Signaling: Methods and Protocols is a valuable resource and will help chemists, drug designers, biochemists, molecular biologists, cell biologists, pharmacologists, and (electro) physiologists navigate the mare magnum of endocannabinoid research.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback version her](https://amzn.to/2SX1Ypl)e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2017** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cannabis Pharmacology: The Usual Suspects and a Few Promising Leads**\n\n**\\~** Ethan Ruso &Jahan Marcu\n\n*The golden age of cannabis pharmacology began in the 1960s as Raphael Mechoulam and his colleagues in Israel isolated and synthesized cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabinol, and other phytocannabinoids. Initially, THC garnered most research interest with sporadic attention to cannabidiol, which has only rekindled in the last 15 years through a demonstration of its remarkably versatile pharmacology and synergy with THC. Gradually a cognizance of the potential of other phytocannabinoids has developed. Contemporaneous assessment of cannabis pharmacology must be even far more inclusive. Medical and recreational consumers alike have long believed in unique attributes of certain cannabis chemovars despite their similarity in cannabinoid profiles. This has focused additional research on the pharmacological contributions of mono- and sesquiterpenoids to the effects of cannabis flower preparations. Investigation reveals these aromatic compounds to contribute modulatory and therapeutic roles in the cannabis entourage far beyond expectations considering their modest concentrations in the plant. Synergistic relationships of the terpenoids to cannabinoids will be highlighted and include many complementary roles to boost therapeutic efficacy in treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, cancer, and numerous other areas. Additional parts of the cannabis plant provide a wide and distinct variety of other compounds of pharmacological interest, including the triterpenoid friedelin from the roots, canniprene from the fan leaves, cannabisin from seed coats, and cannflavin A from seed sprouts. This chapter will explore the unique attributes of these agents and demonstrate how cannabis may yet fulfil its potential as Mechoulam's professed “pharmacological treasure trove.”*\n\n[Free PDF version. ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317354478_Cannabis_Pharmacology_The_Usual_Suspects_and_a_Few_Promising_Leads)\n\n**Video: The Pharmacology of Cannabis Cannabinoids and Terpenes by Dr Ethan Russo**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3rJoiPN\\_6k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3rJoiPN_6k)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for Research**\n\n**\\~**  National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine \n\n*Significant changes have taken place in the policy landscape surrounding cannabis legalization, production, and use. During the past 20 years, 25 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis and/or cannabidiol (a component of cannabis) for medical conditions or retail sales at the state level and 4 states have legalized both the medical and recreational use of cannabis. These landmark changes in policy have impacted cannabis use patterns and perceived levels of risk. However, despite this changing landscape, evidence regarding the short- and long-term health effects of cannabis use remains elusive. While a myriad of studies have examined cannabis use in all its various forms, often these research conclusions are not appropriately synthesized, translated for, or communicated to policy makers, health care providers, state health officials, or other stakeholders who have been charged with influencing and enacting policies, procedures, and laws related to cannabis use. Unlike other controlled substances such as alcohol or tobacco, no accepted standards for safe use or appropriate dose are available to help guide individuals as they make choices regarding the issues of if, when, where, and how to use cannabis safely and, in regard to therapeutic uses, effectively. Shifting public sentiment, conflicting and impeded scientific research, and legislative battles have fueled the debate about what, if any, harms or benefits can be attributed to the use of cannabis or its derivatives, and this lack of aggregated knowledge has broad public health implications. The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids provides a comprehensive review of scientific evidence related to the health effects and potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis. This report provides a research agenda \"outlining gaps in current knowledge and opportunities for providing additional insight into these issues \"that summarizes and prioritizes pressing research needs.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback version](https://amzn.to/2VfvXVU)\n\n[Free PDF version ](https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=24625)\n\n[Video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtqoYwvPoY)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cannabinoid Pharmacology**\n\n*Cannabinoid Pharmacology, Volume 80 is a new volume in the Advances in Pharmacology that presents reviews of recent breakthroughs.

These past years provided a remarkable and constant number of breakthroughs, showing that the signaling mediated by endocannabinoids and lipid mediators impacts almost every function of the body. Indeed, this represents a special field of research, which allows tackling the complexity of biological functions, and provides potential therapeutic frameworks for a plethora of diseases. The number of exciting discoveries brought up to the scientific community almost on a daily basis highlights the importance of an updated volume on this topic. Particularly, given that potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis and cannabinoids are currently under heavy analysis in many Countries worldwide. Hence, the main objective of this book is to explore not only some of the many functions of endocannabinoids (and lipid mediators) in physiological control of networks at a cellular and molecular level, but also to extend this knowledge for potential use of cannabinoids and/or drugs regulating endocannabinoid levels in vivo as therapeutic target(s) in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this book new findings and ideas about the endocannabinoid system and its roles as neuronal circuit modulator related to human brain pathologies characterized by alterations in neuroplasticity will be highlighted. Endocannabinoid roles in key systems controlling appetite, pain, learning and memory, as well as sleep and stress responses will be presented. In addition, pathological processes associated with changes in endocannabinoid signaling will be discussed in the context of anxiety, autism, depression and addiction. This book will provide an excellent background to researchers looking for extending their areas of interest, and to newcomers in the field.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version her](https://amzn.to/2GGLWJp)e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cannabinoids and Their Receptors (Methods in Enzymology Book 593)**\n\n\\~  Patricia H.

(Family: Cannabaceae) is one of the oldest sources of fiber, food and medicine. This plant has been of interest to researchers, general public and media not only due to its medicinal properties but also the controversy surrounding its illicit use. Cannabis has a long history of medicinal use in the Middle East and Asia, being first introduced as a medicine in Western Europe in the early 19th century. Due to its numerous natural constituents, Cannabis is considered a chemically complex species. It contains a unique class of terpeno-phenolic compounds (cannabinoids or phytocannabinoids), which have been extensively studied since the discovery of the chemical structure of tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), commonly known as THC, the main constituent responsible for the plant’s psychoactive effects. An additionally important cannabinoid of current interest is Cannabidiol (CBD). There has been a significant interest in CBD and CBD oil (extract of CBD rich Cannabis) over the last few years because of its reported activity as an antiepileptic agent, particularly its potential use in the treatment of intractable epilepsy in children.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version here](https://amzn.to/2U0R6Da)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Endocannabinoid System in Local and Systemic Inflammation**\n\n**\\~** Melanie E. M. Kelly et al\n\n*This book focuses on the role of the endocannabinoid system in local and systemic inflammation, with individual chapters written by experts in the field of cannabinoid research and medicine. The topics explore the actions of the endocannabinoid system on the immune system, including neuroinflammation in autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's, as well as local and systemic inflammatory conditions affecting organs including the eye (uveitis and corneal inflammation), the bladder (interstitial cystitis), pancreas (diabetes), cardiovascular system (stroke), joints (arthritis), and sepsis. The objective of this book is to provide knowledge transfer on the use of cannabinoids in inflammatory disease by critically examining preclinical and clinical research on the immunomodulatory actions of the endocannabinoid system, with specific emphasis on the actions of cannabinoids in diseases where inflammation is a prominent component. By drawing these results together, we seek to provide further understanding of the complexities of endocannabinoid system modulation of immune function and identify potential uses and limitations for cannabinoid-based therapeutics.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2V8BKga)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2016 \n\n**Handbook of Cannabis**\n\n\\~ Roger Pertwee \n\n*Truly global in scope and with contributions from leading researchers around the world, The Handbook of Cannabis is the definitive resource on this fascinating drug. Combining scientific perspectives and clinical applications, it covers a vast array of topics, from why over the centuries cannabis has been used as a medicine, through the regulations facing those wishing to self-administer cannabis or provide cannabis-based medicines, to the chemical structure of its many constituents and the rapidly growing group of synthetic cannabinoids that are currently being used for 'legal highs'.*\n\n*With each chapter written by a group of one or more internationally recognised subject experts, it provides academics and researchers with authoritative scientific material on the main pharmacological actions and their effects, as well as their pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and forensic detection. In addition it also examines the complex morphology, cultivation, harvesting, and processing of cannabis and the ways in which the plant's chemical composition can be controlled.*\n\n*As well as offering a raft of scientific information there is extensive coverage of cannabinoid-based medicines. Helping readers to identify and evaluate their benefits, chapters explore pharmacological actions and the effects that seem to underlie approved therapeutic uses, how they are currently used to treat certain disorders, and the ever-growing number of wide-ranging potential clinical applications. There is also coverage of both the legal and illegal sources of cannabis, including 'coffee shops' and 'cannabis dispensaries'.*\n\n*The complex issue of 'recreational cannabis' is also tackled. The sought-after and adverse psychological and non-psychological effects are described and discussions are included on how some adverse effects can be lessened by at least one constituent of cannabis, and that it might be possible to reduce the harm that cannabis does to some by changing current regulatory policies.*\n\n*The Handbook of Cannabis is a one-stop reference; essential reading for all clinicians, pharmacologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists interested in this drug, as well as those working in the field of public health.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version here](https://amzn.to/2E2V6wd)\n\n[Free PDF version](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Oliver_Kayser/project/Studies-on-Cannabis-sativa-and-Cannabinoids/attachment/58985a4e934940fcce445c68/AS:458723438141442@1486379598327/download/Handbook_Cannabis.pdf?context=ProjectUpdatesLog)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marijuana and Mental Health**\n\n\\~  Michael T. Compton\n\n*Even while many American states have passed legislation pertaining to medical marijuana and others have decriminalized or even legalised recreational use, a debate continues within society as to whether marijuana is simply a harmless substance that should be fully legalised, a possibly beneficial treatment for patients with certain illnesses, or a drug with the potential to worsen addiction and cause mental health problems. The controversy persists in the medical community as well, where accumulating evidence implicates cannabis use, especially in adolescence, as a risk factor for poor educational achievement and substance use disorders, as well as schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, all of which complicates the heated discourse on legalisation.*\n\n*Although other books have explored the medical cannabis and the neuroscience behind cannabis, no single source of comprehensive information on cannabis and mental health has existed to date. Balanced, focused, and highly readable, Marijuana and Mental Health fills this void. It provides an academic foundation for further study while also informing clinical mental health practice as well as policy decisions by articulating the connection between cannabis and mental health.*\n\n*Relatable clinical vignettes that contextualize these issues and illustrate the clinical applicability of the content, as well as key chapter points that emphasise major takeaways, make Marijuana and Mental Health the authoritative reference for clinical and research psychiatrists, psychiatric trainees and fellows, clinical psychologists, and psychiatric nurses.*\n\n[Buy paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2Vee35X)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015\n\n**Cannabinoids in Neurologic and Mental Disease**\n\n\\~  Liana Fattore\n\n*The application of cannabis sativa for the treatment of neurologic and mental disease is expanding.

In the brain, endocannabinoids regulate ion channel activity and neurotransmitter release and thereby contribute to various aspects of brain function, including memory, reward and emotions. Their ability to modulate synaptic efficacy has a wide range of functional consequences and provides unique therapeutic possibilities. Unprecedented advances have been made in the understanding of the role of endocannabinoids in the regulation of the emotional brain over the past few years. However, a comprehensive book encompassing all these aspects is still lacking. The book will provide an overview of the role played by the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of emotional processes with particular emphasis on the modulation of memory and reward for emotionally arousing events and for the regulation of motivational aspects in cannabis use.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version her](https://amzn.to/2EoEcK3)e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2013 \n\n**The Therapeutic Potential of Marihuana**\n\n\\~  Sidney Cohen\n\n*Scientific information about cannabis and its components has grown exponentially during the past decade. Certain of the findings have led to exploratory studies into the therapeutic utility of the drug. At the present time, a number of areas of usefulness have been investigated, with some showing greater promise than others. At what point should these data be collected and presented? Should it be early, after some initial impressions have been obtained? Or should it come later, following confirmatory studies by others? Both stages of development are represented in this volume. In a number of instances, the papers consist of hitherto unpublished material. It seemed worthwhile to bring together the investigators working in a wide variety of disciplines who had in common their research activities in the therapeutic aspects of the cannabinoids and related synthetic compounds. This was done at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, California during November, 1975. The papers presented and the ensuing discussion constitute the contents of this volume. It is the Editors' hope that the book will stimulate further involvement in the therapeutic studies. It should not be expected, nor is it anticipated that some cannabinoid will be available commercially in the near future. The nature of the approval process is such that years elapse between initial testing, however promising, and final approval for marketing. This is particularly true for a completely new chemical entity, and even more so for one with a checkered reputation.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2GG4PMP)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2011 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Taming THC: potential cannabis synergy and phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects**\n\n\\~ Ethan Russo\n\n*Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been the primary focus of cannabis research since 1964, when Raphael Mechoulam isolated and synthesized it. More recently, the synergistic contributions of cannabidiol to cannabis pharmacology and analgesia have been scientifically demonstrated. Other phytocannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabigerol and cannabichromene, exert additional effects of therapeutic interest. Innovative conventional plant breeding has yielded cannabis chemotypes expressing high titres of each component for future study. This review will explore another echelon of phytotherapeutic agents, the cannabis terpenoids: limonene, myrcene, α-pinene, linalool, β-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, nerolidol and phytol. Terpenoids share a precursor with phytocannabinoids, and are all flavour and fragrance components common to human diets that have been designated Generally Recognized as Safe by the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies. Terpenoids are quite potent, and affect animal and even human behaviour when inhaled from ambient air at serum levels in the single digits ng·mL−1. They display unique therapeutic effects that may contribute meaningfully to the entourage effects of cannabis-based medicinal extracts. Particular focus will be placed on phytocannabinoid-terpenoid interactions that could produce synergy with respect to treatment of pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Scientific evidence is presented for non-cannabinoid plant components as putative antidotes to intoxicating effects of THC that could increase its therapeutic index. Methods for investigating entourage effects in future experiments will be proposed. Phytocannabinoid-terpenoid synergy, if proven, increases the likelihood that an extensive pipeline of new therapeutic products is possible from this venerable plant.*\n\n[Read online version](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165946/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2009 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Cannabinoid Receptors**\n\n\\~ Patricia H.

ElSohly \n\n*Although primarily used today as one of the most prevalent illicit leisure drugs, the use of Cannabis sativa L., commonly referred to as marijuana, for medicinal purposes has been reported for more than 5000 years. Marijuana use has been shown to create numerous health problems, and, consequently, the expanding use beyond medical purposes into recreational use (abuse) resulted in control of the drug through international treaties. Much research has been carried out over the past few decades following the identification of the chemical structure of THC in 1964. The purpose of Marijuana and the Cannabinoids is to present in a single volume the comprehensive knowledge and experience of renowned researchers and scientists. Each chapter is written independently by an expert in his/her field of endeavor, ranging from the botany, the constituents, the chemistry and pharmacokinetics, the effects and consequences of illicit use on the human body, to the therapeutic potential of the cannabinoids.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback/kindle version here](https://amzn.to/2SVqeYH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2005 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cannabinoids as Therapeutics**\n\n\\~  Raphael Mechoulam\n\n*Only a few years ago the endocannabinoid system was unknown. Today we are aware that endocannabinoids are involved in many of the functions of the mammalian body - in neuroprotection, appetite and suckling, pain, reproduction, anxiety, memory, bone formation etc. This volume presents an up-to-date picture of some of the major fields of endocannabinoid research. It summarizes the actions of the endocannabinoids on various physiological systems and opens new therapeutic windows to a large number of diseases.*\n\n*The first chapter, on the use of Cannabis in India, can be viewed as an expression of thanks to the herbal practitioners, who for centuries passed on the medical traditions associated with the drug. The chapter on chemistry is a short summary of active plant, synthetic and endogenous cannabinoids being investigated today, many of which are mentioned later in the book. Cannabidiol is an unusual cannabinoid - it does not bind to the known receptors and yet exerts a variety of effects. Hence a chapter is devoted to it. Further chapters deal with the endocannabinoid system and the endocannabinoids in a variety of conditions and physiological systems. The concluding chapter describes the research done on Sativex®, a standardized plant extract, shortly to be introduced in Canada as a drug for multiple sclerosis.*\n\n*The intended audience is drug researchers (medicinal chemists, pharmacologists, clinicians), neuroscientists, physiologists, and clinicians interested in the effect of the endocannabinoid system in various physiological systems.*\n\n[Buy hardcover version here](https://amzn.to/2EplK3L)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marijuana and Cannabinoid Research: Methods and Protocols (Methods in Molecular Medicine)**\n\n\\~ Emmanuel S.

Can marijuana ease their symptoms? Would it be breaking the law to turn to marijuana as a medication? There are few sources of objective, scientifically sound advice for people in this situation. Most books about marijuana and medicine attempt to promote the views of advocates or opponents. To fill the gap between these extremes, authors Alison Mack and Janet Joy have extracted critical findings from a recent Institute of Medicine study on this important issue, interpreting them for a general audience. Marijuana As Medicine? provides patients--as well as the people who care for them--with a foundation for making decisions about their own health care. This empowering volume examines several key points, including: \\* Whether marijuana can relieve a variety of symptoms, including pain, muscle spasticity, nausea, and appetite loss. \\* The dangers of smoking marijuana, as well as the effects of its active chemical components on the immune system and on psychological health. \\* The potential use of marijuana-based medications on symptoms of AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and several other specific disorders, in comparison with existing treatments. Marijuana As Medicine? introduces readers to the active compounds in marijuana. These include the principal ingredient in Marinol, a legal medication. The authors also discuss the prospects for developing other drugs derived from marijuana's active ingredients. In addition to providing an up-to-date review of the science behind the medical marijuana debate, Mack and Joy also answer common questions about the legal status of marijuana, explaining the conflict between state and federal law regarding its medical use. Intended primarily as an aid to patients and caregivers, this book objectively presents critical information so that it can be used to make responsible health care decisions. Marijuana As Medicine? will also be a valuable resource for policymakers, health care providers, patient counselors, medical faculty and students--in short, anyone who wants to learn more about this important issue.*\n\n[Buy in paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2VftiM5)\n\n[Free PDF version](https://www.nap.edu/login.php?record_id=9586&page=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nap.edu%2Fdownload%2F9586)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1999 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base**\n\n\\~ Institute of Medicine\n\n*The medical use of marijuana is surrounded by a cloud of social, political, and religious controversy, which obscures the facts that should be considered in the debate. This book summarizes what we know about marijuana from evidence-based medicine--the harm it may do and the relief it may bring to patients. The book helps the reader understand not only what science has to say about medical marijuana but also the logic behind the scientific conclusions. Marijuana and Medicine addresses the science base and the therapeutic effects of marijuana use for medical conditions such as glaucoma and multiple sclerosis. It covers marijuana's mechanism of action, acute and chronic effects on health and behavior, potential adverse effects, efficacy of different delivery systems, analysis of the data about marijuana as a gateway drug, and the prospects for developing cannabinoid drugs. The book evaluates how well marijuana meets accepted standards for medicine and considers the conclusions of other blue-ribbon panels. Full of useful facts, this volume will be important to anyone interested in informed debate about the medical use of marijuana: advocates and opponents as well as policymakers, regulators, and health care providers.*\n\n[Buy hard cover version here](https://amzn.to/2Sn7Hj0)\n\n[Free PDF version ](https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=6376)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1997 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Therapeutic Uses of Cannabis**\n\n\\~  British Medical Association\n\n*At the last Annual Representative Meeting of the British Medical Association a motion was passed that \\`certain additional cannabinoids should be legalized for wider medicinal use.'' This report supports this landmark statement by reviewing the scientific evidence for the therapeutic use of cannabinoids and sets the agenda for change. It will be welcomed by those who believe that cannabinoids can be used in medical treatment. The report discusses in a clear and readable form the use and adverse effects of the drug for nausea, multiple sclerosis, pain, epilepsy, glaucoma, and asthma.*\n\n[Buy hardback/paperback version here](https://amzn.to/2SV8EEn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1984\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Cannabinoids: Chemical, Pharmacologic, and Therapeutic Aspects**\n\n\\~ Stig Agurell\n\n*The Cannabinoids: Chemical, Pharmacologic, and Therapeutic Aspects provides a comprehensive discussion of the various aspects of cannabis and its constituents.*\n\n*The book is organized into six sections. Section I covers the clinical aspects of cannabis including the health aspects, impact on memory function, and the characteristics and treatment of marijuana abusers. Section II on chemical aspects includes studies on the chemistry and structure-activity relationships of cannabinoids; smoking characteristics of marijuana cigarettes; and developments in cannabinoid analyses of body fluids. Section III on metabolic and pharmacokinetic aspects includes studies on the metabolism, disposition, and pharmacokinetics of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in men and women; single dose kinetics of cannabidiol in man; and distribution and disposition of THC in different tissues of the rat.*\n\n*Section IV on reproductive aspects include studies on the effects of chronic administration of THC on the early embryonic development of mice; effects of cannabinoids on spermatogenesis in mice; and possible mechanism for the cellular effects of marijuana on male reproductive function. Section V on neuropharmacologic aspects includes studies on the discriminative stimulus properties of THC and the effects of cannabinoids on neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Section VI on therapeutic aspects includes studies such as the possible anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol; tetrahydrocannabinol effects on extrapyramidal motor behaviors in Parkinson's disease; and the use of cannabinoids in glaucoma.*\n\n[Buy in hardback/kindle version here](https://amzn.to/2GGuO6y)",

They're ideal for those seeking relief without heavy sedation or anxiety.\n\nEach strain’s effect is also shaped by cannabinoids (like CBG or CBC), terpenes (aromatic compounds like myrcene or limonene), and flavonoids (which add color and subtle therapeutic properties). Together, they create what's called the entourage effect—a synergy where these compounds enhance each other’s benefits, making the experience more holistic and personalized.)\n\nScience findings compiled by the skunkman\nhttps://www.icmag.com/threads/recent-interesting-findings.305499/\n\nThese are all solid choices if you want function over fog. I’ll keep updating this list as I discover more—drop your go-to gentle strains below so others can benefit too.\n\nLet’s make it easier for everyone to medicate with confidence ✌️ (42K views) \n\nmuch love j ",

A 2009 study reported that the moderate long-term use of marijuana was associated with a reduced risk of head and neck cancers.\nFull text of the study, “The effect of cannabis plant extracts on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and the quest for cannabis-based personalized therapy,” appears in Cancers. Additional information on cannabinoids and cancer is available from NORML’s publication, Clinical Applications for Cannabis and Cannabinoids.\"",

Companies state that it creates a \"luxury experience\" but I think this idea is terribly outdated and excludes those who are fragrance sensitive. Adding pleasing smells to get people to use what might otherwise be a lackluster product is really manipulative.\n\nThe origin hardly matters when many of the essential oils used can increase photosensitivity or are allergens in their own right (lavender, for example). People who love fragrance can add lotions or perfumes to their own routine that are specifically about that sensory experience. If it is skincsre or fragrance, all that matters to me is that it accomplishes its task well.\n\nThe worst is when they try to justify the use of a fragrant plant oil saying it has properties good for skin, when those good properties can be gotten from other efficacious, less irritating ingredients that won't photosensitize the skin or cause allergix flare-ups.",

    "body": "**Prologue:**\n\nHey everyone. It's been a while since I (M, late 20s) last posted here. I used to be fairly active, as I was first learning how to adapt to the hellish condition that is LPR, and this sub was my main resource for the various trials and tribulations I underwent as I frantically searched for a cure. It is no exaggeration when I say that this has by far been the worst experience of my life.\n\nNothing I found in this sub turned out to be legitimately effective in advancing my LPR journey. Understandably, this subreddit is home to the most tormented bunch of people on the planet.\n\nWell, a long time ago I told myself I'd come back once I beat LPR, to spread the good word. Before you get too excited, it's worth mentioning that it's not 100% gone for me, although I am exercising, drinking alcohol, gaining healthy weight, and living my life again. I'm here now, to tell my story.\n\n━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI'm not a doctor. Most people in this sub are not doctors. Many doctors you've spoken to are not even acid reflux doctors! In the same way, I can't give medical advice. Same goes for the people in this sub. Then what about your doctor? Idk, I can't tell you if your doctor is right or wrong. I'm just here to tell my story.\n\nThe mechanism of action for your LPR may not be the same as everyone else's. Many things can cause it. If you see someone selling a book, an app, a magical diet plan or exercise regiment, idk!!! Just be skeptical of the asshats that will steer you wrong. It will often be a money grab. Sometimes people like to give advice just because they believe they know what's right.\n\nWell here’s the thing: if they don't know the root cause of your LPR, there's a pretty good chance that the solution they're offering is baseless and misguided.\n\n━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━\n\n**Exposition:**\n\nMy LPR came about after I went through a gnarly breakup. I started working out a lot and wanted to gain weight because I had always been pretty skinny.\n\n* I was under a ton of stress\n* I ate way too much\n* I drank a lot of alcohol and coffee\n* I smoked a ton of weed\n* I went horizontal on the couch after dinner\n* I did a lot of things that gave way to my LPR\n\nThese are the symptoms that I was dealing with:\n\n* I couldn't breathe in all the way\n* I had an extremely aggressive post nasal drip, like a faucet in the back of my throat\n* I yawned a lot more than most people do\n* I had an insane amount of anxiety that didn't feel like normal anxiety\n* I had globus sensation\n* I had a bounding pulse that shook my whole body\n* I had tons excess mucus\n* I lost my voice\n* I burped a lot\n* I probably had other symptoms that I'm not remembering right now\n\n━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━\n\n**Rising Action:**\n\nMy primary care physician (who I no longer see) was the first doctor I saw about my illness. I didn’t know anything about reflux, and apparently neither did he. He treated me for a long time in ways that only made my condition worse. LPR is a slippery slope, and this bastard unknowingly pushed me down it.\n\nFor about 2 years I went from doctor to doctor, trying anything and everything they suggested to get my symptoms under control. It wasn’t apparent whether it was aggravated by certain types of foods - again, I tried everything. I couldn’t eat anything without setting off my symptoms. I couldn’t even drink water in peace. I fell to 115 pounds. I thought about suicide. I cried everyday for a long time. I took a break from real life.\n\nThroughout my journey, I tried all of these things. Maybe they’ll help you, but I’m just talking about me here.\n\n* I saw maybe 15 different specialists\n   * ENTs, GIs, Allergists, etc.\n* I spent thousands of dollars on appointments and tests\n   * Barium X-ray, lung x-ray, pulmonary function test, esophageal manometry test, upper endoscopy, EKG, heart bubble test, blood panel, etc.\n* Dietary insanity\n   * Paleo, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, keto, Mediterranean, intermittent fasting, etc.\n* Idk what to call these: snake oil, ymmv\n   * Reflux Reboot, Fast Tract Diet, probably more…\n* Medication and supplements\n   * Antibiotics\n      * Did nothing\n      * My doctor thought I had bronchitis. He never heard of LPR before me\n   * Prednisone\n      * Did nothing\n   * Lansoprazole (PPI)\n      * I don't really remember. Certainly didn't fix me.\n   * Omeprazole (PPI)\n      * Fuck this\n   * Nexium (PPI)\n      * This really fucked me up!\n   * Pepcid (H2 blocker)\n      * Actually this may have helped me a bit\n      * You can buy generic Famotidine for cheaper)\n   * Allergy medications\n      * Had nothing to do with my LPR\n   * Lexapro (SSRI)\n      * Actually did a little to help my LPR\n   * Zoloft (SSRI)\n      * Not much to say about it\n   * Wellbutrin\n      * Did nothing for my LPR\n   * Ginger\n      * Probably did nothing\n   * Throat coat tea\n      * Did nothing\n   * Gaviscon Advance (the UK version)\n      * This really fucked me up!\n   * DGL (licorice extract)\n      * Did nothing\n   * D limonene\n      * Did nothing\n   * Digestive enzymes\n      * Did nothing\n   * Carafate\n      * Great for gastritis\n   * Probably a lot more that I’m not remembering\n\nAt the end of the day, there was no doctor who directly said “here is what you have. You have LPR.” They would speak hypothetically so as to avoid being wrong.\n\n“I’m not saying you have acid reflux, but if you \\*did\\*, here’s what I would have you do…”\n\nMy tests said that I only had minor signs of acid reflux or irritation.\n\nOver and over, I would get the same suggestions about changing my diet, my lifestyle, and how I should sleep on my left side on an incline. At one point I could respond “yes I know, I’ve actually been doing all that for a year and a half and it hasn’t changed a thing.” I want to emphasize that this was most certainly the worst experience of my entire life. It really felt like I was hanging on by a thread at this point.\n\n━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━\n\n**Climax**\n\nAt one point in my journey I searched for an acid reflux doctor in the area. I had already seen so many specialists but I saw one who seemed different. He wasn’t a standard GI, but a doctor who specialized in acid reflux. He had me do this test where, for 24 hours, I had a wire inside me going from my nose to my stomach to measure acidity. The test came back with literally 0 signs of reflux.\n\nI trusted his expertise. He called this a “nerve sensitivity issue.” Per his suggestion, I started taking TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants) like Amitriptyline. They are antidepressants, but they are often used for nerve pain.\n\n**It was like night and day. My symptoms receded more and more, and I couldn’t believe it. Honestly, typing this out makes it sound kind of unreal, like some sort of infomercial for a miracle cure. I can’t stress enough how relieved I was, after two years of absolute hell.**\n\nAmitriptyline worked, but due to side effects I switched over to Nortriptyline. My “nerve” symptoms are kept at bay as long as I continue my Nortriptyline regiment. The plan is to take it for a year, then see if I can taper off off it without my nerve symptoms coming back. I hope I’ll be able to stop taking it eventually but I don’t know if I’ll be okay after a year, or if I’ll have to take it forever.\n\n━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━\n\n**Resolution**\n\nI was on Nortriptyline for a full year before I arrived at the conclusion that I wasn't even close to being ready to come off of it. Nortriptyline did an excellent job of masking my symptoms, but after trying some trigger foods I realized I wasn't healed. I saw yet *another* GI and *another* ENT. The ENT actually gave me some incredible insights. Honestly though, I probably wouldn't have gotten them if I didn't ask the right questions.\n\nI basically sat down and said 'ok look, I've been doing this for so long. I've tried everything - been on Nortriptyline for a year. Am I even getting anywhere? Do I need to continue and just wait it out, or do I need to just retrain my body somehow?' (yes this was kind of a stretch bc I was going insane)\n\nTo paraphrase his response: this is a nebulous medical issue with a psychosomatic component. Many people call it LPR but this case in particular is esophageal hypersensitivity. With it, there are two schools of thought and one of them is usually right. (1) You can heal with time and (2) you have to teach your body to respond differently.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. I crossed the finish line with these two strategies:\n\n* Hypnotherapy\n   * The GI recommended that I see a hypnotherapist. I initially thought this was a ludicrously stupid suggestion but I was at the end of my rope. I tracked down a hypnotherapist and did three sessions with her. Primarily, I learned that hypnotherapy isn't what I thought it was. Long story short: hypnotherapy fucking rules. It helped SO much. I would highly suggest it to any sufferers reading this.\n   * Disclaimer: hypnotherapy is much more likely to work if you give it a fair shot. Honestly I do not entirely understand how it works, but I am 100% positive that it helped my case.\n   * Find yourself a hypnotherapist who can gear your sessions toward your illness. Many hypnotherapists specialize in illnesses like this one and have had experience in treating IBS and other weird afflictions.\n   * Learn how to meditate. It'll make your sessions much more effective.\n* Idk what to call this\n   * I basically started introducing trigger foods into my diet despite them triggering me. For example, I'd normally drink coffee and get a weird tingle in my throat before it ruined my whole entire week. Try to conceptualize the weird tingle as an opportunity to heal. Tell your body to shut the fuck up and smile through the pain. If you want it to be okay then make it okay.\n   * I did coffee, alcohol, chocolate, food with red sauce, etc. All the triggers.\n\nThe hypnotherapy and forced-eating of trigger foods was October/November. It's January now and I'm tapering off of Nortriptyline (now at 20mg). I can drink alcohol and eat whatever I want. I can even have THC gummies. I can't believe I'm here but I'm so grateful to have my health back. I'm free and healthy!!!!\n\n**Healing is not linear.**\n\nEsophageal hypersensitivity is a weird illness that requires a weird solution.\n\nDon't give up. Seriously, I absolutely guarantee it will be worth it when you return to yourself.\n\nDon't take misery for an answer. Fix it or adapt. Time will pass regardless.\n\nGood luck to you. Go get your life back!!\n\n*TLDR; (go see a doctor who specializes in acid reflux, esophageal hypersensitivity, etc.)*\n\n━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━  ━\n\nEDIT: Lots of you have messaged with personal questions. I'll paraphrase them here so everyone benefits.\n\nBut let me first just say, I want to respond to all of your messages but I'm just not going to. I'm glad this post is helping so many of you. I really am.\n\nI have received *so many* DMs. Many of you are asking redundant questions that have already been addressed in this post or in the comments. I feel that I've made this post elaborate enough that it should answer all the right questions.\n\n**Q&A:**\n\n* How did you manage to get through that?\n   * Chronic illnesses are truly debilitating. By far the worst experience in my life.  The worst parts of my experience went on for 2+ years. I barely managed to get through it. It was mentally just so brutal.  It really helped to take a break from everything, and maybe I was fortunate in being able to do that. Every choice you make should reflect your healing process.  If there’s anything you can do to keep your head above water, even if only for a little bit, it’s worth it. If you keep pushing and pushing, you’ll get to the bottom of this sooner or later.  And the best part is that you’ll feel even better than you did before all this. You may need to watch what/when you eat, but emotionally and mentally, you’ll feel incredible. Superhuman. Issues in your daily life will pale in comparison to the hardship you’ve faced with your illness. This could be your training arc. On the other side, you'll actually feel stronger than ever thought you could be. Everything good that happens to you will feel like it's deserved, and everything bad will hardly compare to what you've already overcome.\n* Do you ever have a sore throat?\n   * My throat rarely had any physical pain. It happened but not so often. I’m not totally sure what implications that has for my condition vs yours\n* Did you cough throughout the day and after eating?\n   * Not really. Maybe a little coughing, idr but it definitely wasn't the bane of my existence.\n* Not really a question but this person was \"eating chocolate cream\" then \"having a little sensation of not breathing properly\" and \"anxiety escalating it into oblivion\"\n   * Yep, chocolate has caffeine in it which can aggravate LPR symptoms. I usually stay away from it dairy and caffeine. Dairy makes me feel like I've got a lot of mucus, and even with my new body I just don't trust caffeine.\n* Can you smoke weed now?\n   * Weed is one of my worst triggers, if not my #1 worst trigger. Wish I could smoke but it's far from worth it.\n* What side effects did you get from Amitriptyline?\n   * Dry mouth and fatigue\n* More about TCAs:\n   * If Amitriptyline doesn’t do it for you, maybe ask your doctor about alternatives like Desipramine or Nortriptyline. Desipramine gave me horrible headaches but I was able to settle on Nortriptyline. It has very mild side effects (for me at least). But still, I’m pretty sure Amitriptyline is the strongest.\n   * I noticed the effect of my Amitriptyline at 10mg but it was much more effective when I reached \\~80mg. Same with Nortriptyline. 80mg was my max.\n   * It took me about a month before I started noticing the effects of the TCAs.\n* What about PPIs?\n   * They never worked for me and actually made me extremely symptomatic. Super counterproductive in my case. Maybe that’s some sort of indication for how my condition could differ from yours. I’m really just speculating here though *shrugs*\n* Did you have a messed up tongue too?\n   * Nope\n* Do you know which nerve is responsible?\n   * Nope, but I'm pretty sure my doc said it's not the vagus nerve.\n* \"But you never had reflux or LPR. The test proved that, so this story is moot. Unless of course you were on the PPI while you got the wire test. Besides that, and unless I’m missing someone huge, this post was very disappointing\"\n   * Idgaf if you find this post disappointing 😂\n   * I saw lots of doctors and they all had different ways of describing my condition. Some doctors found evidence of acid reflux damage and some didn’t. In the end, after trying many many options, nerve medication, hypnotherapy, and meditation worked for me.",

I feel too many people in health related subreddits like this one, only come here looking for a cure and once they find it and heal themselves they forget reddit exists and go on with their life (fair enough, but how can others come and search for answers as you once did if you don't share your success story).\n\nI have have also been through hell and back and got prescribed nortriptyline a few weeks ago but didn't take it because I was worried about taking such a strong medication and was probably too proud to take something with anti-depressant in the name.\n\nNon the less, i've reached a point where I have been in pain so long I have nothing left to lose, so I started taking it last night after another appointment with my GI. Don't know if I can feel any effect today apart from a bunch of fatigue and headache. But i'm sure these will go away in a few days and i'll come back to update this post if people are interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - update 1 year on: The nortriptyline has massively helped with my pain, mainly heart palps and the burning abdominal pain. I'd say it's taken at least half the pain away which is massive. And for anyone that's got extreme pain like 8-9/10 all day everyday, you know it makes you suicidal, so going from an 8-9 down to a 3-4 is massive. That being said I still have a lot of the same issues just less severe, so I think whatever it is that is causing this pain is still yet to be discovered and the nortiptyline is just a bandaid that is helping cover the root. But you can bet that I'm going to keep taking it as long as I need to if it means I am in less pain every day. I am going for a follow-up with my GI again next week to hopefully get some more answers, even though I am not hopeful as they're usually very dismissive. But I am hoping given the amount of time this has been going on they take it more seriously this time around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR, I've basically had a very similar experience to op:\n\n>I was on Nortriptyline for a full year before I arrived at the conclusion that I wasn't even close to being ready to come off of it.

I've suspected my anxiety might've been a result of my GERD issues and would rather just stop taking lexapro but I'm also worried about the effects of just stopping it.",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

Was MRP 490 for 500 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years. I'm on my second tub\n\nConsistency: White cream.\n\nUsage: I take one big spoonful, add it to half a mug of water, swirl it around till it mixes with the water, dip my hair in and leave it. I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Plum has a 100 million sales throughout. You can get it for around 450ish.\n\nUsage Timeline: No clue. I'm on my third tub.\n\nConsistency: Thick white cream\n\nUsage: This works both ways. Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna.

I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

The next 28 terpenes are ordered alphabetically, and generally occur in smaller amounts.\n\n**1. Myrcene**  (Beta-Myrcene)  \nThe most common terpene in cannabis and hemp that can make up more than 2% of the weight of some [chemovars](https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/blog-cannabis-cultivars-vs-chemovars-vs-chemotypes-a-breakdown-n1374); also found in mangoes, thyme, citrus, and lemongrass, it has a musky, earthy, sweet herbal aroma. It is largely responsible for the green hop aroma in beer and is a major component in dry hopped beer. A [2021 published review study on Myrcene is here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8326332/).  \nBoiling Point: [333ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/31253#section=Boiling-Point) (167ºC)  \n*Reported Benefits:* THC agonist (helper), anti-diabetic, anticatabolic (preserves muscle mass), analgesic (pain reduction), gastrointestinal aid, neurological aid, anti-anxiety, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antispasmodic, anti-tumor, sedative (relaxant or sleep aid) \n\n**2.** **Caryophyllene** (Beta- or Trans-Caryophyllene)   \nJust about as common as Myrcene in cannabis and hemp flower and can exceed 2% by weight. It has a spicy, peppery aroma and is also found in black pepper, cloves, hops, and oregano.  \nBoiling Point: [493ºF](http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1060851.html) (256ºC) (several reputable sources have reported this to be 266ºF, but that is NOT at atmospheric pressure of 760mm Hg; [266ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/beta-caryophyllene#section=Boiling-Point) is the boiling point at 14mm Hg)  \n*Reported Benefits:* analgesic (pain reduction), antidepressant, anti-anxiety, bone stimulant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antispasmodic, antitumor, anti-diabetic, gastrointestinal aid, neurological aid \n\n**3. Limonene**  \nThe final member of the \"Big Three\" terpenes in cannabis and hemp flower. Contributes a citrus aroma and is commonly found in citrus fruits, lemon rinds, juniper, and peppermint.  \nBoiling Point: [349ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/440917#section=Boiling-Point) (176ºC)  \n*Reported Benefits:* anti-anxiety, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antispasmodic, anti-tumor, gastrointestinal aid, may potentiate cannabinoids (enhance bioavailability or effects)\n\n**4. Pinene** (Alpha- and Beta-Pinene)   \nPinene is considered the most common naturally-occurring terpene on earth. Both alpha-pinene and beta-pinene have similar properties and aroma. It's got that pine forest aroma and is found in pine needles, dill, basil, parsley, conifers, and sage.  \nBoiling Point: alpha: [313ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6654#section=Boiling-Point) (156ºC), beta: [331ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/14896#section=Boiling-Point) (166ºC)   \n*Reported Benefits:* alertness/focus enhancing, memory retention, anti-anxiety, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antitumor, antiviral, bronchodilator, gastrointestinal and neurological aid\n\n**5. Humulene** (Alpha-Humulene, Alpha-Caryophyllene)  \nContributes a woody, spicy-clove, \"watery\" aroma and is also found in allspice, hops, cloves and coriander. While it is common in cannabis and hemp flower, it is usually found in small amounts (<0.2%). Here's a [summary of recent research at ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/humulene).  \nBoiling Point: 334ºF ([168ºC](http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1027221.html))  \n*Reported Benefits:* appetite suppressant, analgesic (pain reduction), anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-spasmodic, anti-tumor\n\n**6. Linalool**  \nA cannabis terpenoid also found in lavender, it has a floral, citrusy sweet aroma.

Frosty medium to dense long bud structure. Covered in crystal trichomes and orange calyxes. fairly big nugs and some mediums. About the same stickiness as Romulan, very well cured and good moisture content again. Quite sticky as you break up the bud and has some give when you squeeze.\n\n_AROMA: 10/10 : Initial opening you get a very strong nose of peppermint menthol🌿, with sweet undertones of baked goods 🍰🧁 and some slight gas ⛽. Perhaps some pine needles 🌲 but very fresh. This is a very strong scent but very complex and satisfying one.️\n\n_TASTE: 10/10 - Completely smooth, with slight subtle minty-ness. Initially was very concerned that it might be overpowering with menthol but to my surprise it was a really nice smooth sweet flavour.\nInhaling was almost a cooling sensation from the menthol and it rounds off with a really sweet creamy almost vanilla texture.\n\n_EXPERIENCE: 9.5/10 - Again with all great cannabis, it has a smooth burn with white ash and heavy oil streaks on the paper. Unlike Romulan, this wasn't a creeping effect but more a delayed onset. You kind of don't feel anything for a few minutes then it ramps up very quickly.\nTingling body feeling with some euphoric mental state.  It is a full head experience initially but moves very quickly to the body. Very relaxed and chilled state. I would describe it as more 'dreamy' and floaty.\nI slept like a log with this, wow. i actually passed out on the couch which never happens but might've been tired and this at the same time.\n\n_OVERALL: 9.8/10 - Where do i start? This is from the Kootenay region in Canada, known for some of the best cannabis in the world. Thoroughly enjoyed this strain. Top tier quality. It slots straight into probably my top 3 at the moment. It has a really subtle flavour of menthol without being super over powering, with the added creaminess it gives it a lot of body and texture.\nI had appendicitis this week and ended up in hospital and it was exactly what i needed.\n\n_Would I buy again?: 1000% YES _Would i keep in rotation?: YES\nRRP $165",

Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

I wanted to share this with everyone and hope that someone out there finds it helpful. Love ya’ll ^~^\n\n(I found [folliculitisscout.com](https://folliculitisscout.com) to be a great database of seb derm safe products, not that only the ones with the green tick in the image are totally Sen derm safe)\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n\nTreatment/Routine:\nDo NOT use any oils or fatty alcohols except squalane oil, mct oil without lauric acid and mineral oil. Only these oils and a few essential oils like tea tree oil and Rosemary oil are seb derm safe. Refer to the science behind this in Research down below.\n\nScalp:\n- Aveda rosemary mint shampoo (clarifying shampoo that also contains white vinegar)\n- Selsun suspension shampoo (selenium sulfide 2.5%)\n- No conditioner\n- Comb through squalane oil from Biossance after washing for moisture\n\nUse the clarifying shampoo and selsun only once a week. Wash with clarifying shampoo first and then use selsun. This makes selsun work better as it penetrates the scalp better without all the buildup and dirt getting in the way.\n\nUse Giovanni tea tree shampoo every 2 days and wash twice as it’s really gentle. It contains mild sulfates that don’t strip moisture out your hair. Use very little product the second time.\n\nUse 1-2 drops of squalane oil\n\nFace:\n- Simple kind to skin refreshing face wash (gentle cleanser)\n- Sebamed clear face gel (moisturiser free from oils and fatty alcohols)\n- Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ (Only the one with the green cap is safe)\n\nDon’t use these right away if your just stating out:\n- Cosrx BHA Blackhead (salicylic acid toner comparable to the Paula’s choice bha 2% but Paula’s choice is not seb derm safe so go with this)\n- The ordinary niacinamide 10% \n\nWash my face twice a day with the cleanser and then moisturise. I apply sunscreen once in the morning everyday after moisturising.\n\nTwice a week, use  Cosrx bha and wait for it to dry before applying the moisturiser.\n\nDo not use niacinamide till after one day if you use Cosrx bha as it causes irritation.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nResearch:\nWhat I’ve found is that all oils like avocado oil, argan oil, coconut oil etc. and fatty alcohols like Cetyl alcohol, Streayl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol feed the Malassezia fungus which is the primary contributor to seb derm and dandruff. All these oils are recommended by skincare influencers for a healthy scalp and hair but don’t work those of us with seb derm.\n\nMost essential oils are also safe but I don’t recommend using anything except tea tree oil and Rosemary oil.\n\n[post pic change](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/set-of-hair-care-products-gm1012364510-272711404)\n\n[simple skincare science](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-malassezia-pityrosporum-routines/)\n\nYou can refer to the above link for a more detailed explanation but I’ll try my best to simplify it.\n\nSo malassezia feeds on compounds in between C-12 to C-24 carbon chain and the oils which are made from compounds outside this carbon chain are seb derm safe, they don’t feed the fungus and are the safe oils like squalane oil, mineral oil, mct oil without lauric acid. Lauric acid should be avoided as it’s formula is C-12:0 which feeds the fungus and makes seb derm worse.\n\nExample: \n[Coconut oil composition (composition and comparison paragraph)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_oil)\n\n[Composition (the info below)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044790/)\n\nCoconut oil is composed of the fatty acids, caprylic acid C-8:0 (8%), capric acid C-10:0 (7%), lauric acid C-12:0, (49%), myristic acid C-14:0(8%), palmitic acid C-16:0 (8%), stearic acid C-18:0 (2%), oleic acid C-18:1 (6%) and 2% of C-18:2 linoleic acid.\n\nHere all the compounds except caprylic C-8 and capric acid C-10 fall in C12 to C24 category so only these two are safe but only make up 15% of coconut oil together. Other compounds which make up the rest of the 85% fall in the C12 to C24 category so in conclusion coconut oil is unsafe.\n\nExample 2:\n[Tea tree oil (composition and characteristics)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_tree_oil)\n\nterpinen-4-ol\t35.0–48.0%\nγ-terpinene\t14–28%\nα-terpinene\t6.0–12.0%\n1,8-cineole\ttraces–10.0%\nterpinolene\t1.5–5.0%\nα-terpineol\t2.0–5.0%\nα-pinene\t1.0–4.0%\np-Cymene\t0.5–8.0%\nSabinene\ttraces–3.5%\nlimonene\t0.5–1.5%\naromadendrene\t0.2–3.0%\nledene\t0.1–3.0%\nglobulol\ttraces–1.0%\nviridiflorol\ttraces–1.0%\n\nNot a single compound is from C12 to C24 category hence it’s safe to use. Dilute this oil in squalane or mct oil before using.\n\nCheck all products for fatty alcohols and unsafe oils before buying them\n\n- - - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - - -\n\nFeel free to drop any questions/suggestions on how to improve this post down below. This is my first reddit post so any input is appreciated :)\n\nEdit: TLDR replaced some products which I found to be unsafe with completely seb derm safe alternatives.\n\n- Replaced Paula’s choice bha 2% with Cosrx bha as Paula’s choice is not seb derm safe :(\n- Replaced old sunscreen with new seb derm free one \n- Replaced the Giovanni tea tree oil shampoo with Pyunkang Yul low ph scalp shampoo as Giovanni contained Polysorbate 20 which was not seb derm safe :(\n- Replaced the Pantene lively clean shampoo with Aveda rosemary mint shampoo as Aveda is more gentle \n- Replace The Ordinary Squalane oil with Biossance as it is completely sugarcane based, broke out a little from the ordinary and found a report that The Ordinary sometimes sources Squalane from olives due to seasonal supply chain changes so stick with only sugarcane derived squalane as the squalane olive is unsafe",

        "body": "Story time:\n\nI’ve been suffering from seb derm on my scalp majorly and a tiny bit on my eyebrows and on the face ever since 8th grade. I’ve visited countless derms and high end clinics that prescribed everything from ketoconazole (nizoral) and coal tar shampoos to clobetasol propionate creams. At one point when I was 17 (2019) this derm misdiagnosed my condition as psoriasis and this was one of the darkest phases of my life as I thought that I had this incurable autoimmune disease that only had limited research on it. It’s really hard for a teenager to accept something like this especially when he’s a skinny kid with acne and had a lot of self esteem issues, topping it off with a shitload of dandruff flakes. \n\nAlternating between ketoconazole and coal tar shampoos worked for a while as long as I used them regularly until *drumbeats* 2020. During the covid lockdown my the internet and my mom suggested coconut oil (psoriasis people used it to find relief as far as I remember idk) which made EVERYTHING a lot worse, the shampoos and creams stopped working, my flakes were huge, yellow and oily af (I know ew). I was devastated and started searching for solutions desperately, this is when I found Reddit and many other people suffering from the SAME exact condition which my dumbass though was psoriasis (man I wanted to throw hands with that derm who misdiagnosed me). I started to read and understand more about seborrheic dermatitis and stopped using coconut oil. Tried all the solutions found on various subs like ACV rinse, tea tree oil, not washing your scalp much, washing your scalp way too much, sulfate free shampoos, co-washing and a million different products. \n\nNothing worked and I kept trying until early 2022 and I started my first year o uni, this is when I reverted back to ketoconazole buttttt life’s a bitch and it didn’t work that well anymore, probably due to the deep conditioner I was using at the time. I stopped using it and the flakes exploded like really bad. This was when my friend, who I met in uni and had the same condition as me, suggested this selsun shampoo which totally changed the game. He was using it since like 3 years (once a week) and apparently it never failed him, I found a YouTube video that also said the same thing. Boy he was right that shit is straight up liquid gold and smelled so good (sarcasm duh anything that works this good has to smell bad but I ain’t complaining). I was so so so fucking HAPPY man, literally flexed my clean scalp to all my friends. But wait it’s not all happy ending, lived flake free ever after yet. \n\nThing is selsun worked flawlessly but being a dumbass I wanted to fix my dry hair so I bought various conditioners and leave-in conditioners in late 2022 and the flakes came back a tiny bit and I freaked out but selsun took them way so I kept experimenting. I found out that I had curly hair which was low porosity after researching a bit on reddit, which meant that my hair had a hard time absorbing oils and products which left me with an oily scalp and dry hair. It was recommended on a few places in the curly hair community that people with low porosity hair should wash their hair like 2-3 times a week and use a clarifying shampoo once a week or they faced build up. I was curious cuz this build up may have caused my seb derm as I didn’t wash my hair properly and never used a clarifying shampoo. Shampoos with sulfates were also seen as better for low porosity hair as they removed build up better than sulfate free shampoos and I kept using sulfate free shampoos all this time cuz after 2010s with the rise of cgm sulfates were demonised and were seen as damaging to our hair and I believed the same. I found out that sulfates are actually good and at the same time made another breakthrough where I found out that all oils and fatty alcohols contributed to seb derm as they fed the fungus malassezia so stopped using them and voila I was right, flakes completely disappeared. I also stopped using Cetaphil moisturising lotion on my face as it contained avocado oil and boom clear was clear and the redness disappeared. \n\nThat my dear patient readers was how I wrapped up 2022, ending both the year and the long battle against seb derm. I feel a lot better these days, just good vibes and clear af skin and scalp. Something that I’ve learnt over these last few years is that every single problem has a solution, it’s up to us to find it! *flexes scalp lol*",

I have aswell (a similar system to yours, Squalane is very good and I thank the elder gods for the Ordinary in general). \n\nThat being said,  I know I will probably have to change it soon as topicals (for me) just seem to be a bandaid solution; it's likely systemic. Finding the root cause has been a bitch. \n\nKetoconazole cream (pharma grade) worked initially but pooped out after about a year, same with most other pharma and over the counter fixes. \n\nI really, really wish I didn't react to Niacinamide (exascerbates acne), I'm part of that *small* population who does - I don't know whether that reaction is more likely if you have sebderm or not but the shit is in everything, (and arguably for most - for good reason, it's pretty miraculous for many.)\n\nSo question: A lot of people with Sebderm have sparse hair growth and miniturization (sharp, short, very pointed hair that only grows partially and tends to fall out) of their hair at the temples/part/crown. Rosemary oil is known to not only inhibit sebderm but also stimulate hair growth in general as it reduces DHT. Did you have sparcity in your crown to begin with and have you noticed any difference in hair growth on the regions (either face or scalp) with which you applied the oil?",

Unfortunately, it carries with it a long history of being a persecuted plant.\" Dr. Donald Abrams Chief of Hematology Oncology at San Francisco General Hospital ||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nApproximately 106,000 Americans die yearly from prescribed medications, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nEven more frightening, preventable medical errors account for a staggering 400,000 deaths in the U.S. each year - and is considered the 3rd leading cause of death.\n\n>\"It's equivalent to 2,000 commercial jets taking off each year knowing that they don't have enough fuel to complete their journeys,\" notes Peter Edelstein M.D.  \n   \n\"Would you allow your spouse to board one of those planes? Your friend? A stranger?\"\n\nGood question.\n\nIncreasingly, people in the West are seeking out treatments that work harmoniously with the body, instead of against it - in other words, they're walking away from the medical establishment and all its mishaps, mistakes and pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nA case in point is cannabis, especially in its raw form.  \n \n\n**A Rich History**  \nMarijuana is one of those plants that, to many, conjures visions of *Drug Enforcement Administration* (DEA) raids and hippies in a drugged-out daze.\n\nBut it wasn't always this way.\n\n>\"The ancient Chinese knew of marijuana's pain-relieving and mind-altering effects, yet it was not widely employed for its psychoactive properties; instead it was [cultivated as hemp](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_industryhealthiermedica.htm#Hemp_-_C%C3%A1%C3%B1amo) for the manufacture of rope and fabric.  \n   \nLikewise, the ancient Greeks and Romans used hemp to make rope and sails. In some other places, however, marijuana's intoxicating properties became important. In India, for example, the plant was incorporated into religious rituals.  \n   \nDuring the Middle Ages, its use was common in Arab lands; in 15**th**\\-century Iraq it was used to treat epilepsy; in Egypt it was primarily consumed as an inebriant.  \n   \nAfter Napoleon's occupation of Egypt, Europeans began using the drug as an intoxicant. During the slave trade, it was transported from Africa to Mexico, the Caribbean and South America. Marijuana gained a following in the U.S. only relatively recently.  \n   \nDuring the second half of the 19**th** century and the beginning of the 20**th**, cannabis was freely available without a prescription for a wide range of ailments, including migraine and ulcers,\" Roger A. Nicoll and Bradley N. Alger remind us in Scientific American.\n\nEven American Founding Father **Thomas Jefferson** declared:\n\n>\"Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country.\"\n\nSo what happened?  \n\n\nIn 1937, the United States Congress decided - against the recommendation of the American Medical Association - to pass the [Marijuana Tax Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937). The legislation essentially banned the use of marijuana by making it excessively expensive and difficult to secure.\n\nIt has been downhill ever since. That is, until the last few years where legalization of marijuana has exploded in the U.S., for both recreational and medicinal uses.\n\nFor our purposes here, we're going to look at the health benefits of the plant - which are quite impressive.  \n \n\n**An Essential Vegetable**\n\n>\"It \\[cannabis\\] has captured these molecules that help our bodies regulatory system be more effective.  \n   \nThe bottom line is it's a dietary essential that helps all 210 cell types function more effectively. I don't even refer to it as medicine anymore, strictly as a dietary essential.\"  \n**Dr. William L. Courtney**\n\nIt may be a stretch for some to recognize raw cannabis as the next in-demand superfood, but Dr. **William L.** **Courtney**, a physician with extensive medical training who specializes in the dietary uses of cannabis, presents a provocative case.  \n\n\nWhen you heat or age cannabis, Dr. Courtney believes that *you lose* *99%* *of the benefit cannabis provides.*\n\nIn contrast, if you consume it raw, you'll reap the full value of the plant. Plus, raw cannabis is non-psychoactive, so you won't experience a high - an important point for those who would like to utilize the healing aspects of cannabis without feeling drugged or off-center.\n\nThis means you can also consume a much higher amount of health-promoting compounds with raw cannabis juice compared to if it was smoked or extracted as an oil, according to Dr. Courtney.\n\n>[Terpenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene), essential oils found in cannabis which give the plant its unique aroma, are particularly compelling.  \n   \nA study ([Taming THC - Potential Cannabis Synergy and Phytocannabinoidterpenoid Entourage Effects](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/taming-thc.pdf)) published in the *British Journal of Pharmacology* states that terpenoids are,\"pharmacologically versatile: they are lipophilic, interact with cell membranes, neuronal and muscle ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, G-protein coupled (odorant) receptors, second messenger systems and enzymes.\"  \nThe researchers explored the powerful effect terpenes exert in animal tests.  \n[Limonene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limonene) was found to increase serotonin in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the hippocampus region of the brain - both of which help fend-off depression and feelings of stress.  \n   \nMoreover, limonene induces apoptosis (cell death) of breast cancer cells and demonstrated exceptional radical scavenging properties. It's also remarkably bio-available, rapidly metabolized and is highly non-toxic and non-sensitizing.  \n   \n[Myrcene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrcene) is anti-inflammatory and an effective sleep aid, while pinene acts as a bronchodilator and broad spectrum antibiotic - including the destruction of lethal MRSA bacteria.  \n   \n[Pinene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinene) also curbs inflammation. Linalool is a sedative and anticonvulsant.  \n   \n[Caryophyllene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caryophyllene) is antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and useful in treating duodenal ulcers.  \n   \n[Nerolidol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerolidol) inhibits fungal growth and protozoal parasites.  \n   \n[Phytol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytol) increases GABA expression, resulting in a calming effect.\n\nThese are just a handful of the 200 varieties of terpenes found in cannabis.\n\n**How to Enjoy More Raw Cannabis in Your Life**  \nFor a daily dose, Dr. Courtney advises juicing fifteen cannabis leaves and two buds, which is then added to a small amount of fruit or vegetable juice that is consumed throughout the day.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about juicing cannabis, [this article](http://www.medicaljane.com/2013/01/19/cannabis-the-foundation-of-health/) offers tips and suggestions. Keep in mind that juicing improperly may create heat, which will cause THC to form.\n\n**Jeffrey C. Raber**, Ph.D. also recommends having the strain of marijuana you're using tested at a reliable and accurate lab so you know exactly what you are getting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Leaf\n\n[VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa0nLdVJiIg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Sources**\n\n>[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/patient-power/201409/do-you-know-the-3rd-leading-cause-death-you-should](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/patient-power/201409/do-you-know-the-3rd-leading-cause-death-you-should)  \n[http://www.humboldtjustice.com/images/BrainsOwnMJ-SA04-NoPix.pdf](http://www.humboldtjustice.com/images/BrainsOwnMJ-SA04-NoPix.pdf)  \n[http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/juicing-raw-cannabis-eating-raw-cannabis/](http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/juicing-raw-cannabis-eating-raw-cannabis/)  \n[http://www.cannabisinternational.org/info/Non-Psychoactive-Cannabinoids.pdf](http://www.cannabisinternational.org/info/Non-Psychoactive-Cannabinoids.pdf)  \n[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165946/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165946/)  \n[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robbie-gennet/on-role-models-and-their\\_b\\_164387.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robbie-gennet/on-role-models-and-their_b_164387.html)  \n[http://www.projectcbd.org/medicine/terpenses/](http://www.projectcbd.org/medicine/terpenses/)  \n[http://thewercshop.com](http://thewercshop.com/)",

This is not medical advice intended to treat or diagnose anyone, just my own case study.\n\nI didn't take all of these at once, I usually took no more than 2-4 herbs at a time. For extra liver safety when taking multiple herbs at once, look up CYP interactions between the herbs and any existing medications you take and avoid taking combinations that might interact (or consult with your doctor). Most of the supplements I used are from Thorne Research, Pure Encapsulations, Metagenics, Organic India, Life Extensions, and Designs for Health. Research your brands carefully; the supplement industry is largely unregulated.\n\n# Helpful\n\n**Bolded** are the most helpful; interventions in which I noticed a difference almost immediately.\n\nHerbals:\n\n* **Berberine** (works best on empty stomach)\n* **Allicin** (works best on empty stomach for me, but causes reflux and gastritis after awhile so I can only take it for a couple of weeks at a time)\n* **Neem** (1000mg, with meal)\n* Oil of Oregano (Very strong...I caution against jumping to this one immediately. I always took with meals since I couldn't tolerate this on an empty stomach.)\n* Olive leaf extract (empty stomach)\n* Grape seed extract (empty stomach)\n* Nigella sativa extract (empty stomach)\n* Milk thistle (silymarin)\n\nMotility agents:\n\n* **Ginger** (specifically MotilPro, but it eventually caused heartburn and LPR for me so I had to stop)\n* **Triphala** (empty stomach)\n* **Magnesium citrate** (up to 400mg per day, although I usually take 100-200mg, or 300mg at most)\n* **Artichoke extract** (empty stomach)\n* MCT oil (i'd take a teaspoonful whenever i was feeling particularly backed up, as an emergency treatment)\n* spoonful of olive oil on empty stomach in the morning\n* dark chocolate (Double edged sword as this also increased histamine reactions for me. Also need to be careful what dark chocolate you buy because many sources of chocolate have high levels of heavy metals in them.)\n\nFiber supplements:\n\n* **Bimuno**\n* Sunfiber\n\nDigestive aids:\n\n* **Betaine HCl with pepsin** (I was taking up to 6 500mg pills per meal at one point, and tapered slowly off of that as I started producing more stomach acid. Stress also lowers the amount of stomach acid you produce. The die-off from taking 1 pill of this for the first time frightened me and I almost didn't try it again, I got very dizzy and almost felt like I was going to faint. I'm very glad I tried again.)\n\nLifestyle changes:\n\n* **EMDR** or IBS focused meditation\n* Walking, running, or other forms of low/medium impact cardio exercise\n* Squats/deadlifts (can trigger bowel movements)\n* **Sleeping before 1am**\n* **Sleeping > 6 hours a night**\n* Not eating 3-4 hours before bed\n* **No snacks between meals** (good for motility)\n* Whatever activities or changes you can do in your life to reduce stress\n* Singing or karaoke (stimulates vagus nerve, self-soothing)\n\nDietary changes:\n\n* Avoiding dairy ([How do you think methanogens got into your gut?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5344914/))\n* Increase variety of plant foods - eat the rainbow, and eat organic if possible, or at least avoid the [Dirty Dozen](https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php)\n* Specific foods that encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria in your gut microbiome: walnuts, kiwi, pomegranate, broccoli sprouts, legumes (lentils and green peas being two of the most easily tolerated ones, especially if you didn't previously eat a lot of legumes), sweet potatoes, spices (black peppercorn). There are many more beneficial whole foods, these are just some of my favorites that I try to eat every couple of days.\n* Eating something like the mediterranean diet (low to medium fat, low to medium protein, medium low-glycemic carb intake, high in fiber, plants, spices, fruits, and polyphenols) turns out to be healthiest for [your gut microbiome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385025/) - everything in moderation, no major restrictions in diet\n\nProbiotics:\n\nI am especially picky with probiotics because I noticed increased histamine/MCAS-like reactions to some probiotics that I've taken in the past. I try not to take any probiotics these days that aren't single-strain. The strands below should all be non-histamine producing or releasing strains.\n\n* **B. longum bb563**\n* **B. coagulans MTCC 5856 (Lactospore)**\n* B. infantis\n* S. Boulardii CNCM I-745 (Florastor)\n\nBiofilm buster:\n\n* Nattokinase (be careful taking this if you're on blood thinners)\n\n# Didn't notice a big difference, but potentially helpful\n\n**Bolded** are interventions that I felt were more on the \"potentially helpful\" end of \"no difference\" for digestive issues, or things that I would consider trying again. Some of these I took for their adaptogen or mood-boosting effects, hoping that it would lessen stress and help with stomach pain or reflux, but ultimately I didn't notice a huge change from taking them. I'm no longer taking most of these, and of the ones I've continued taking, I'm taking them for reasons other than digestive health.\n\nHerbals:\n\n* **Atrantil** (2x pills per meal)\n* Andrographis\n* Artemisinin (another one to be careful of taking long-term, i suggest no more than 2 weeks at the most)\n* Fenugreek\n* Asafoetida (mostly used in cooking, great for making legumes easier to tolerate)\n* Cinnamon\n* **Parsley oil**\n* **Quercetin** (helped with increased histamine reactions caused by probiotics but didn't do much for stomach problems)\n* Gymnostemma\n* Pomegranate extract (Some research actually shows that this can decrease acidity in your stomach, so be careful about taking it if you already suspect low acid. I always take this for a couple of days when I notice any gastritis symptoms and it helps a lot with that.)\n* Green tea extract\n* **Sulforaphane** (careful taking this for longer than 2-3 weeks at a time, stop immediately if you start feeling any pain in your liver)\n* Apigenin\n* Tumeric/Curcumin (caused increased reflux for me too)\n* Cranberry extract\n* Ashwagandha\n* Mushrooms (reishi, lion's mane, chaga, turkey tail - some of these actually increased constipation for me)\n* Astaxanthin\n* Bittermelon extract\n* **Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice**\n* **Slippery elm**\n* **Marshmallow extract**\n* Aloe Vera extract\n\nFiber:\n\n* Arabinogalactan\n* Acacia fiber\n* Glucomannan\n* Apple pectin\n* Flax seed fiber\n* Psyllium husk ([Taking too much of this (or any fiber) can actually increase constipation too](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/).)\n* **Beta-glucan**\n* **HMOs**\n* Modified citrus pectin\n\nOther supplements:\n\n* Inositol (Didn't have any particular improvement in digestive issues, but I've continued taking after noticing increased mood and wellbeing)\n* **Colostrum** (empty stomach in the morning)\n* Magnesium L-threonate\n* Magnesium glycinate (hoping it would help with sleep, but didn't really notice much benefit)\n* L-glutamine\n* **Vitamin C** (reducing severity of histamine reactions)\n* Iodine + Selenium\n* Zinc L-Carnitine\n* **Vitamin B12** (I still take about 1000mg once a week, just because I don't eat that much meat)\n* Vitamin D3 + K2 (I still take this because I don't get that much sunlight)\n* Omega 3 Fish Oil\n* Phosphatidylcholine\n* Ubiquinol\n* D-Limonene (tried for acid reflux)\n* Sodium Alginate (tried for acid reflux)\n\nDigestive aids:\n\n* Swedish bitters\n* **Digestive enzymes**\n* Beano\n\nBiofilm busters:\n\n* Serrapeptase\n* Klaire Labs Interfase Plus\n\nProbiotics:\n\n* Biogaia L. reuteri DSM 17938 (I made yogurt with this too and also didn't notice a huge difference...it may have actually increased my gas a little, as many lactobacilli seem to do)\n* Pendulum Akkermansia (there's chicory inulin in this as a prebiotic which might cause some symptoms for people)\n* B. subtilis\n* Other various bifidobacterium strains\n\n# Possibly harmful\n\n* Any [lactic acid bacteria probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6006167/) or fermented foods - kefir, kimchi, yogurt, sauerkraut\n* Processed foods\n* Seed oils\n* Sugar alcohols ([sorbitol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35792179/) found in prunes and apricots are often used to trigger bowel movements, but it doesn't seem to be good for you long term)\n* Artificial sweeteners and even some natural sweeteners ([stevia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9028423/)!)\n* Inulin, FOS (feeds everything, including fermenting bacteria)\n* Long-term FODMAP diet (reduces diversity of your gut microbiome over time)\n* Low salt diet (Sodium chloride is one of your main sources of chloride. Guess what your stomach needs to produce HCl? That's right: chloride!)\n* Melatonin (severely slows down gut motility and causes constipation for me whenever I take it, even at <1mg)\n* THC/CBD (also slows down gut motility)\n* Alcohol (literally poison for your gut microbiome...i indulge rarely, and only socially)\n* Metagenic MegaSporeBiotic (caused me to have histamine reactions that lasted even after I stopped taking them)\n* [Overdosing on laxatives/increasing gut motility to the point of diarrhea](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418305853)\n\n# Didn't try but would consider doing in the future\n\n* TUDCA\n* Xifaxan/Rifaximin (I was never offered this or any other antibiotics by any of my doctors. I could probably have gotten even more second opinions or pushed harder, but I wanted to see if herbals worked first.)\n* Phage-based probiotics\n* Looking into pelvic floor therapy or checking to see if pelvic muscle dysfunction is a possible root cause\n* Lactoferrin\n* Moringa\n* Tulsi\n* More herbals (There are many more herbals out there that I haven't heard of or researched yet.)\n* Prolonged fasting up to 2-3 days (Unsure about this, as research shows that fasting can increase Akkermansia...but interestingly, it also increases methanogen presence in the gut. [The gut bacteria of anorexia patients is enriched in methanogens as well.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7835121/))\n* Elemental diet (I also think of this as a last resort because it'll really kill the diversity in your gut microbiome)\n* FMT (if suitable donor/doctor could be found, but from what I've read so far it can be a mixed bag of unpredictable side effects and therapeutic benefit)\n\n=================\n\nThis is a throwaway account and this post is a thank-you to this community and everyone who has shared their stories and approaches. If you take anything away from this, let it be that there is always hope as long as you're still alive, and \"do your own research\" - by which I mean, try to read actual scientific articles from pubmed or other journals to confirm what you're reading online or consult with medical professionals (google scholar is a great resource!). Above all, rely on your own judgement: don't abdicate your critical thinking to anything you read on the internet, including this post.\n\nHere's my story. I was going through an intensely stressful period of my life 2 years ago, culminating in a junk food binge (I had nothing but ice cream, chips, and other processed foods for a week or two). Naively, I thought having some kimchi (probiotics are good right?) and various probiotics would make up for the recent binge. Soon after that I started having a bunch of symptoms:\n\n* Extreme bloating after meals, sometimes I was so bloated I was nauseated\n* Lots of burping, sometimes it would wake me up at night\n* Very little flatulence, all the gas felt like it was trapped in my stomach or colon\n* Constipation and a dull, nagging pain in lower left abdomen, near sigmoid colon (when constipated)\n* Sleeping on my left side when gassy was uncomfortable and painful, it felt like I was lying on some sort of bubble, gas trapped near my splenic flexure\n* Trouble taking a full breath when sleeping on my back\n* Waking up in the morning with sour/acidic taste in my mouth and pain in the back of my throat from acid reflux due to increased gas\n* Could not eat anything with FODMAPs in it without a lot of pain and suffering\n* Increased allergies and histamine reactions\n* Brain fog, fatigue and dizziness, especially after eating\n\nI went to multiple doctors and gastroenterologists who just diagnosed me with IBS and told me to try the FODMAP diet. They refused to do diagnostic exams (endoscopy and colonoscopy) due to my younger age (mid 20s) and lack of occult blood in stool. I tested negative for H. Pylori, but I never ended up taking any SIBO-specific breath tests and mostly went by symptoms and how I felt. My guess was that I was mostly dealing with hydrogen and methane SIBO, as I never had sulfuric smelling gas or diarrhea (besides when I accidentally overused motility agents at various times).\n\nI started with one of the standard herbal treatments recommended in this subreddit:\n\n* Candibactin BR, 2x in the morning, 2x at night\n* Candibactin AR, 1x with every meal\n\nI did this for about 2-3 weeks and felt an almost immediate relief after the first week and a half, although the first couple of days were unbearable with increased die-off gas. In hindsight I'm not sure if I did the right thing going with oregano oil right off the bat. It's very strong and I think I may have permanently damaged my microbiome in some way, because after around 3 months of remission, I started to notice the constipation and pain in my sigmoid colon. What followed that was multiple rounds of different types of herbals as I reached a slightly more \"stable\" place and then relapsed repeatedly. I've listed all the things that I tried above. Most of my rounds were 4-6 weeks long, and then I'd take a break. Taking 2-4 herbs at a time seemed to be mostly safe as I had blood tests during my yearly physicals that showed no abnormalities and good liver numbers.\n\nWhat were my root causes? I suspect high stress (slows gut motility, reduces production of stomach acid), improper use of lactic acid bacteria probiotics and fermented food (fermented food might be fine for people who don't have compromised gut motility, but the food just ended up sitting in my stomach and fermenting even more), and binging on dairy (big source of methanogens in the gut). All of my relapses can be traced back to attempts to fix things with lactic acid bacteria probiotics, fermented food, slipping and having dairy (one of my relapses was caused by a cheese binge!), or having another stressful period in my life where I'd start eating poorly, sleeping poorly, skipping meals, and not exercising.\n\nAfter the most recent round, which was 5 months ago, I've been eating onions, garlic, and other FODMAPs with no problems. I have no major restrictions in my diet besides dairy: I eat nuts, fruit, meat, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, oatmeal, etc, many of which I used to find difficult to digest. I'm still taking Triphala, 100mg magnesium citrate, B. longum bb563, Bimuno, and Sunfiber supportively, but no antibiotic herbals. I've been tapering off the magnesium citrate (down from 300mg/day) and have started to taper off Triphala as well. Current schedule: fiber supplements + probiotics in the morning, magnesium citrate with my evening meal, Triphala on an empty stomach before bed.\n\nAm I cured? I'm not sure...this might be something that I'll have to deal with again in the future. But I'm definitely feeling more optimistic than I've ever been about it, and each time I finish a round of herbals, I've noticed that I'm getting closer and closer to normal. So maybe one day! Good luck to everyone reading this!",

Best known for its true pie-like flavour soothing and cozy effects. Payton's Pie is the perfect indica to add to any night time lineup. Like its name implies, Payton's Pie has a deliciously dessert-like flavor, with hints of creamy banana pie accented by sour citrus. \n\nKind medicals Payton pie definitely has a dessert like aroma and flavour like a banana pie 💯💯 I have never experienced this type of aroma in all my years of being around cannabis. I can’t get my nose away from the tub it’s mind bobbling ! Budz are fresh as and really frosty ! I am really impressed with kind medicals premium range so far as it is in a different league to their other strains in the pouches… \n\nAs I mentioned in the description above the effects are really nice and cozy, doesn’t hit very hard but it works throughout the body making me feel really relaxed and chilled ! I feel it’s more of a creeper and has been working well for me to have a good nights sleep👌👌 I also feel this strain is perfect for anxiety and chronic pain. Paytons pie grinds up really fluffy with a very pleasing exhale as it’s really smooth and tasty ! I also have their tenacious so I am really keen to review that for everyone 😆 Kind medicals premium range is $149 for a 10g tub ",

    "body": "Hey guys!! I just wanna start off by saying I usually do reviews for Korean skincare, but as a Vietnamese person feel like I have so much pride in this brand which proudly comes from my country.\n\nYou mostly know that I am a Sulwhasoo and Whoo guy based on the focus of my reviews previously, and I had never told my followers why it is that I love them so much, in essence. In a world where Asian brands had to resort to using French names, chase high-tech ingredients, and employ Caucasian models, yet still losing market share to Western giants, these brands held true to their roots (literally) and celebrated their culture as well as herbalism. And now, they are the major players in the beauty industry, sitting beside the giants that once could've stomped them like a bug. To me, there is no greater inspirational underdog story in beauty than that. \n\nVietnam has never been popular for its cosmetics industry. Everything from bad packaging to greasy, poor-performing, and even occasionally dangerous formulas. The decent Viet brands wanted to distance themselves from that reputation therefore sometimes, they pretend that their product came from a more developed country (Canada, France, Korea...). \n\nCocoon was the first proudly Vietnamese brand of this echelon (they're sold in drugstores and supermarkets nationwide, online, and now in Malaysia, Singapore, and the US!). They're the second revolution in Vietnamese cosmetics history after Co Ba soap (hopefully writing a blog post about that soon). Extremely affordable, chic packaging, great scents, top-notch ingredients that you'd probably have some trouble finding in even higher-end offerings, and incredible results. They have products made from specialty crops grown in specific regions of Vietnam. This was actually an idea for a skincare line I had for such a long time but they really materialized it and brought it to life, which is beautiful for me. So, let's dive into the mega guide!\n\n##Winter Melon (Bí đao): This is their line for acne-prone, oily, congested, and inflamed skin. They use winter melon extract which is anti-inflammatory and hydrating along with other tried-and-true actives such as Niacinamide, Salicylic Acid, and a form of Azelaic Acid called Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate.\n\n\n###-Micellar water: \nSmells like the toner, with impressive cleansing power. You can remove very waterproof makeup with this. Leaves a refreshing feeling.\n\n\n###-Cleansing gel: \nThis was my cleanser for maybe the better half of 2021. I wouldn't say I mega love it but it's definitely a dependable cleanser and smells like a refreshing tea tree. It doesn't lather much and it doesn't leave my skin dry. The pH is 5.5 and I quite like it, but it gets mundane fast.\n\n\n###-Toner: \nA refreshing alcohol-free toner with winter melon extract, tea tree oil, and Niacinamide. It smells so good, It says it doesn't have \"Fragrance\" but it has rosemary and lavender oil which can explain the scent. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. I felt it was meh for my skin though.\n\n\n###-Mask:\nA soft-drying clay mask with tea tree oil and winter melon extract. Definitely not for sensitive skin. It gives your skin an immediate cool zinging effect which feels like menthol on the skin and I feel like people with more sensitive skin wouldn't like it. It dries quite soft and doesn't leave your skin feeling stripped or dry, but still very clean.\n\n###-Serum: \nThis is their most impressive product in this range by far, it's a serum with winter melon extract, 7% Niacinamide, TECA complex (centella asiatica and constituents), Acetyl Glucosamine, Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate, Ferulic Acid, Bisabolol, Salicylic Acid and Zinc PCA. The serum aims to provide global action for acne-prone skin by bringing down inflammation, hydrating, clearing pores, and brightening leftover acne marks. Now this all sounds great in theory however using it long term I've noticed it doesn't do everything claims to do flawlessly but some of it yes. My acne marks were visibly brightened, my skin looked less red and my texture was a lot more even, even though my raging zits didn't benefit from it. You do get a lot (70ml/2.33oz) for a little under 30 USD so that's great. The texture is very liquidy and foams up if you massage it into your skin which I find a bit off-putting. It wasn't enough to make me stop using it until the upgrade was released.\n\n###-N15 Serum: \nThe extra-strength version of the original serum, boasting a superstar lineup of 15% Niacinamide, 4% N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Mandelic Acid, and many more. This formula originally came in a dropper bottle which made it impossible to dispense and generated many complaints, but I'm glad the brand took notes and repackaged it in a pump. Their attention to feedback is something I admire and that you will continue to see demonstrated in some of the products I name below. The formula is a bright orange, siliconey gel that dries a bit powdery, which you will definitely notice when it clumps up into residue around the nozzle. However, this is one of the best anti-acne treatments I've ever encountered. It targeted my acne in its premature, mature, and post-inflammatory stages and it's just one product. My skin looked visibly clearer after a month and I cannot thank this product enough. Holy grail. \n\n###-Acne drops: \nThis is an interesting spot treatment that omits Salicylic Acid, the first option that comes to mind when formulating a spot treatment. Rather than taking the traditional approach of pure decongestion, it employs 20% Azeclair (equivalent to 6% Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate by weight) in the formula to holistically reduce irritation, inflammation and discoloration. It works pretty fast and is exceptional at bringing redness down, whereas inflammation takes a bit more time. I highly recommend it with the N15. \n\n###-Gel cream:\nA gel cream formulated with 5a-avocuta and TECA to reduce inflammation and control oil production. It is surprisingly oily/tacky at first for a cream that claims to control oil but soaks up quite nicely leaving not much of a residue. On my predominantly dry skin it did not make it any drier. In fact my skin felt comfortable, but not for the whole day.\n\n###-Sunscreen: \nAt SPF 50+ and PA++++ with HEV protection, this unscented organic sunscreen marks one of Vietnam's first forays into the sunscreen market. It is surprisingly lightweight, however it does not dry down matte. I felt like I didn't sweat more with it in (which is a common occurence for sunscreen) and it did stay put very well. \n\n###-Body wash: \nThis is a soap-based body wash scented with lemongrass. It's got a golden liquid texture and foams up very well. It's meant for back acne, but I typically reserve it for the unmentionables OOP because it is deep cleaning, smells good, and prevents odors.\n\n###-Body mist: \nFormulated with a combo of AHAs and BHAs as well as winter melon extract, this body mist demonstrated an excellent anti-acne and anti-redness action on my friend's back. Whereas for me I also use it where I use the above-mentioned body wash since it helps to reduce bumps and even out skin tone for a home-wrecking, soul-crushing, undeniable boochie hole. I would note that this is not something you want on your mucus membranes so please cover them up when spraying areas like your groin.\n\n##Hưng Yên Tumeric (Nghệ): \nThis is their brightening line which uses turmeric from Hưng Yên (my grandma's hometown!) and many other proven actives such as Ethylated Vitamin C, Hexylresorcinol, Acetyl Glucosamine, AHAs and Niacinamide. What I like about this line is that it uses many derivatives of turmeric rather than just its extract.\n\n###-Cleanser: \nFor sure smells like turmeric, not in your face but it's definitely there. 4% of Lactic Acid makes the skin feel slightly smoother after cleansing. Reminds me a lot of my once HG Sulwhasoo Snowise cleanser actually.\n\n###-Toner: \nA toner with 5% AHA and Betaine that aims to brighten, hydrate and smooth skin texture. This formula smells amazing, is hydrating enough to be a treatment essence and after 2 weeks of use leaves skin with a soft glow. All round solid toner even though I'd call it a treatment essence. The addition of Allantoin also lends a nice soothing effect.\n\n###-Mask: \nClay mask enriched with turmeric powder and oatmeal which claims to brighten. It smells strongly of turmeric and has granules. It dries harder more like a traditional clay mask like Kiehl's Tumeric and Cranberry mask and less like their own winter melon mask. My skin always feels nicely clean after using it although instant brightness is not observed.\n\n###-Serum: \nAlso another impressive product from them. Contains 10% Ethylated Ascorbic Acid, a water-stable form of Vitamin C highly efficacious for brightening. Along with that, it's paired with 4% Niacinamide, 2% N-Acetyl Glucosamine, and turmeric oil. It's an orangey gel serum that consists of a continuous yellowish phase with orange droplets suspended throughout. The texture absorbs quickly and leaves the skin slightly moisturized. Results are noticeable at 4 weeks, the skin is more glowing and even-toned. Considering the steep price of ethylated Vitamin C, I am surprised to find out the serum is roughly $30 for a 1oz bottle!\n\n###-C22 Serum: \nAn upgraded version of the classic Serum, this serum contains a whopping 22% of 3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid compared to the original serum's 10%. They also included 4% Niacinamide and 2% N-Acetyl Glucosamine like the original. Still, they bolstered the heightened efficacy with 1% Hexylresorcinol for powerful melanin control and 0.5% Ferulic Acid to create an antioxidant synergy with the Ethylated C. Instead of using turmeric oil to mimic the original, they opted for turmeric extract, which made the formula's color a mild yellow. The texture is fresh and fluid as water, only it left a slightly emollient finish like an oil which was interesting to say the least. After 4 weeks, the serum had a noticeable effect on the dark spots on my periorbital area and redness was reduced. Because of the higher C concentration, my skin did tingle at times after applying the product following another product with actives. And for just 35 USD, this product is absolutely a must-try.\n\n###-Gel cream: \nA gel cream enriched with turmeric extract, curcuminoids, and Hexylresorcinol. This is the lightest moisturizer Cocoon has to offer, bursting into water upon application. It only makes me wonder if it works to moisturize at all. That being said, my skin feels well-rested and fresh after using this every night, and less dull by the end of the day when I use it in the morning. That being said, for as long as this will last me, I will use it as a day cream.\n\n###-Mist: \nA mineral-enriched mist containing powerful antioxidants such as turmeric extract, superoxide dismutase salts, and EGCG. The addition of 5 amino acids also helps to increase moisture retention. The mist smells lovely, the grain of the droplets is extremely fine and almost comparable to an aerosol and it is lovely to apply over makeup. It does help the foundation oxidize less, but I have not noticed much long-term skincare benefit.\n\n##Rose: Sourced from the roses on the highlands of Cao Bang, this line is focused on providing hydration and reparative benefits. The rocky terrain and calciferous nature of the soil create a perfect environment for the growth of Damask roses, rich in tannin which is known for its astringent properties.\n\n###-Bi-phase Micellar Water: \nA true warrior for eye makeup, this bi-phase micellar cleanser was the result of repeated complaints about its predecessor's cleansing abilities. Formulated with rose extract, god-tier antioxidant Astaxanthin, and repairing Vitamin B5. This micellar water removes just about anything and is very gentle on the skin. It also feels more moisturizing than the Winter Melon one But I am not a fan of wiping my makeup off anyway so I won't be reaching for this a whole lot.\n\n###-Cleansing Oil: \nA non-emulsifying, yet rinseable cleansing oil that gives a very interesting feeling. On one hand, it feels very much like an oil on the skin and removes makeup effortlessly. On the other, it is not a true oil chemically speaking, so it can not emulsify but rather just rinse clean off the skin. I really love this product and it is by far my favorite cleanser of the brand, but I would describe this as a one-step cleansing serum. My skin was so smooth after and just clear of everything.\n\n###-Cleansing Gel: \nIt is lightly foaming and subtly scented by the rose. Gives a nice clean that is not drying. But not the most interesting cleanser.'\n\n###-Toner:  \nMade with real rose petals and Hyaluronic Acid, this toner is strikingly plain compared to the precedent other Cocoon products I've tried have set, so I've found it to be nice and enjoyable but quite underwhelming.\n\n###-Mask:\nA rinse-off gel mask with rose petals, Pentavitin and Hyaluronic Acid. It became my new favorite hydration mask ever since I discovered that you can just rub it into the skin with little stickiness. I've used it as a sleeping mask since over moisturizer and I've never woken up with dull skin again. Also since it smells so good, I genuinely don't feel like rinsing this mask off does it justice, but YMMV.\n\n###-Serum:\nHands down, the most impressive hydration and repair serum I have ever used. Holy grail status. It is so fresh and light, but it bears so much substance. Packed with 5% Vitamin B5, 5% Betaine, 5% Urea, Ectoin, Hyaluronic Acid, and rose extract, this serum is an antioxidant powerhouse that calms irritation and hydrates profoundly. Its juicy texture goes a long way and I can see a major improvement in my skin's plumpness and tone after one bottle. Makes my foundation go on better, is amazing on lips, all round great hydrating product. Snag yourself a bottle now because this is my favorite product from Cocoon ever,\n\n###-Gel Cream: \nThe richest moisturizer that Cocoon has to offer, but with that being said it's not that rich. I can use it as a night cream when days are a bit hotter, but under my AC, I always pair it with my trusty Whoo Cheongidan oil. It's got Pentavitin, rose water, Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamin B5, which seems in line with everything else in the range. And I could say that it's a solid staple moisturizer most skin types (except very oily) can enjoy. Drier skins might appreciate this more mixed with a facial oil.\n\n##Dak Lak Coffee: An exfoliating and nourishing line for the body. face and lips made from upcycled coffee grounds. The coffee used was grown in Dak Lak, the capital of coffee in Vietnam.\n\n###-Body Scrub: \nThis creamy, deliciously-scented body scrub smooths, polishes and moisturizes. It is not the most groundbreaking product since it's not the first, but Cocoon's creamy formula along with the appropriately sized coffee granules gave my skin a much-needed invigorating scrub that leaves it softer every time. No wonder it's their #1 best seller.\n\n###-Facial Scrub: \nMade with finer coffee grounds than the body scrub, this unscented scrub smells more naturally coffee than the body scrub's delicious milky coffee scent. It goes on the skin smoothly and is a scrub that never fails to bring the skin an instant glow. I use it in the shower all the time and I love it with my chemical exfoliators because it's got just the right density of granules.\n\n###-Lip Scrub: \nA scrub-in-stick featuring Cocoon's finest coffee grounds suspended in a creamy base of macadamia oil and shea butter. This lip scrub effectively removes dead skin flakes, but at the end of the day not much more impressive than your regular lip scrub. But what more can you ask from a product under 3 USD?\n\n###-Body Butter: \nA deeply moisturizing butter with coffee oil, tamanu oil and shea butter. This was very rich which was surprising, since I was under the impression Cocoon tends to shy away from richer textures. Granted, this is their only richly textured product.\n\n##Pomelo: A haircare line that harnesses the Pomelo oil's active molecule Limonene for effective hair fall reduction, as well as Xylishine, Vitamin B5, and amino acids to thicken, condition, and add shine.\n\n###-Shampoo: \nA sulfate-free shampoo aimed towards all types of hair. This is my regular shampoo since it smells so amazingly citrusy, but I will have to say it's not the most conditioning shampoo, as I felt my bleached hair was quite dry and tangled after shampoo and before conditioner. I also noticed it is not the most color-safe shampoo, and I learned that the hard way when I had my hair dyed blue. But now that I only lighten my hair, I consider this a solid shampoo in terms of cleansing efficacy and strengthening effect.\n\n###-Conditioner: \nA conditioner that smells equally amazing and is so wonderfully smooth. It rinses clean and leaves the hair smooth and soft. Shine is dramatically amplified. Although I regret to say the smoothness was short-lived, only lasting half a day after washing, I understand it is more formulated for virgin Asian hair, not needy bleached hair like mine. They changed the packaging from a pump to a tube due to consumer demand.\n\n###-Hair mask: \nMy favorite hair mask of 2023. The texture is kind of marshmallowy, reminiscent of L'Oreal Professionel's Blondifier mask, albeit a little thicker. Smells amazing and I can feel it gives my hair longer-lasting nourishment than the conditioner, which is why I have substituted it for the conditioner entirely. My hair's shine is so unreal and the softness is incredible.\n\n###-Hair tonic: \nA tonic with Baicapil, Bisabolol, Vitamin B5 and Bisabolol. This product is again another improvement from its predecessor, which was greasy and had a jammed spray nozzle. The new oil-in-water formula comes together shaken, and applied through a targeted nozzle. The new formula is much lighter, has a light hold, and works to increase shine and reduce hair fall.\n\n##Mint and Eucalyptus: A refreshing body care line with mint and eucalyptus oils. The scent is deeply reinvigorating and refreshing but leans a bit masculine.\n\n###-Body Wash: \nThis body wash smells woodsy almost, with an unmistakable menthol tingle. It cleans properly, foams well, and does not dry out the skin. A bit steeper priced compared to drugstore body washes but worth the try.\n\n###-Body Lotion: \nSame scent but no tingle. Its a light gel cream formula that gently hydrates and smooths.\n\n###-Hand soap: \nNever used this one but bet it smells the same. And it is bunny shaped :3\n\n###-Hand Sanitizer: \nMy go to tbh. It smells so spa like using it every time, and I've gotten so many compliments from friends and strangers!\n\n##Miscellaneous products: These are products not from any particular range\n\n###-Palmyra Sugar Body Scrub: \nAn oil and sugar scrub that smells fresh and zesty yet warm. It instantly and dramatically refines skin texture and leaves behind a trace of moisture. My personal favorite of the two Cocoon body scrubs.\n\n###-Inca Inchi hair serum: \nA hair oil with Omege 3, 6 and 9, holy basil oil and vitamin E. This is your average silicone based hair oil and not sure if it works better than a cheaper silicone hair serum but my hair likes it.\n\n###-Ben Tre Coconut Lip Balm: \nMy hometown Bến Tre is known for it's coconuts. The oil extracted from coconuts are used to make this lip balm. It goes on clear and matte, and it gives good emollience to the lips. That being said, it is not that different than other coconut lip balms, maybe the fact that it has a matte finish.\n\n#So that's been it for Cocoon and I'll be back to review more if they launch more. I hope you guys give it a try because I certainly love it!",

It has a higher pricepoint but it's worth it for the quality and minimal packaging.  I introduced this to my sister-in-law who is currently based in Saigon.  She used to have thinning hair because she had a condition before that compromised her immune system.  When I visited her after a few months, I noticed that her hair got thicker.  She just used the shampoo, conditioner, and especially the tonic.  As for me, I have wavy hair (that I dye black every few months) and if I consistently use their conditioner, my hair don't get frizzy.  I'm currently rationing my supply since I won't see my brother till Christmas.  \n\nBest shop to buy it is at Matsukiyo because they give the best specials compared to other drugstores at Gigamall, etc.",

    "body": "The **51st Amendment of the International Fragrance Association (IFRA)** introduced stricter regulations on various fragrance components to ensure safety and sustainability. While these changes aim to protect consumers, they pose significant challenges for perfumers, especially when reformulating iconic classics and beloved contemporary creations.\n***\n**Compliance Deadlines**\n\n**New Formulas:**\n\n* Prohibited ingredients: *August 30, 2023*\n* Full compliance: *March 30, 2024*\n\n**Existing Formulas:**\n\n* Prohibited ingredients: *July 30, 2024*\n* Full compliance: *October 30, 2025*\n***\n\n**Key Ingredient Changes and Impacts on Perfumes**\n\n**1. Hydroperoxides from Linalool and Limonene**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Linalool\n* Limonene\n\n**What Changed:**  \nStricter limits have been imposed on the hydroperoxides formed when Linalool and Limonene oxidize. These allergens are prevalent in floral and citrus accords.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Shalimar* \\- The bergamot-heavy opening will feel less sparkling and effervescent, softening its characteristic freshness.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Dior Sauvage EDT* \\- The bright citrus freshness in the top notes may lose its zesty impact, muting the fragrance's immediate vibrancy.\n***\n\n**2. Synthetic Musks**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Musk Xylene\n* Musk Ketone\n* Musk Ambrette\n\n**Alternatives:** Ambrettolide, Cashmeran\n\n**What Changed:**  \nRestrictions on synthetic musks promote the use of safer alternatives.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Chanel No. 5* \\- The iconic musky dry-down may lose its sensual depth, becoming cleaner and woodier.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Narciso Rodriguez for Her* \\- The plush, velvety musk might feel less enveloping, replaced by a more modern and airy quality.\n***\n\n**3. Oakmoss and Tree Moss**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Oakmoss (Evernia Prunastri)\n* Tree Moss (Evernia Furfuracea)\n* Atranol, Chloroatranol\n\n**What Changed:**  \nTighter restrictions on moss-derived allergens have led to increased reliance on synthetic substitutes.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Mitsouko* \\- The deep, mossy chypre base will lose some of its earthy richness.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Tom Ford Beau de Jour* \\- The green, mossy accords will feel less vibrant, with synthetic alternatives offering a cleaner profile.\n***\n\n**4. Iso-E Super**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Iso-E Super\n\n**What Changed:**  \nNew thresholds limit the use of this cornerstone of woody and amber notes.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Terre d’Hermes* \\- The woody-mineral dry-down will feel less pronounced, softening the fragrance's overall impact.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Escentric Molecules Molecule 01* \\- Reduced levels will make the scent less warm and smooth, affecting its minimalist charm.\n***\n\n**5. Aldehydes**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* C10 Aldehyde (Decanal)\n* C12 Aldehyde (Dodecanal)\n* C16 Aldehyde (Hexadecanal)\n* C18 Aldehyde (Octadecanal)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nStricter allergen limits have been introduced for aldehydes, which lend crispness and sparkle to fragrances.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Chanel No. 5* \\- The iconic soapy and powdery opening will feel softer and less effervescent.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Lancome La Vie Est Belle* \\- The fresh, clean aldehydic top notes will be dialled back, making the fragrance warmer and heavier.\n***\n\n**6. Phthalates**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Diethyl Phthalate (DEP)\n* Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP)\n* Dioctyl Phthalate (DOP)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nPhthalates, used as fixatives, face stricter regulations due to potential endocrine-disrupting effects.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Dior Poison* \\- Reduced fixatives may result in diminished lasting power and projection.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb* \\- Sweetness and warmth may become less intense, making the fragrance feel lighter.\n***\n\n**7. Coumarin**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Coumarin (Tonka bean extract)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nCoumarin restrictions aim to reduce allergenic risks.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Jicky* \\- The powdery, sweet tonka note will be less pronounced, resulting in a more herbal composition.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Armani Si* \\- The powdery sweetness will soften, making the fragrance feel drier.\n***\n\n**8. Cinnamaldehyde**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Cinnamaldehyde (Cinnamon extract)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nCinnamon’s spicy warmth is now more restricted due to its allergenic potential.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Estee Lauder Youth Dew* \\- The fragrance’s spicy intensity will soften.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Jo Malone Cinnamon and Tonka* \\- Cinnamon will feel less spicy, leaning towards a smoother profile.\n***\n\n**9. Geraniol and Citronellol**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Geraniol\n* Citronellol\n\n**What Changed:**  \nTighter thresholds aim to reduce allergenic reactions in floral fragrances.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Yves Saint Laurent Paris* \\- The rose note will become less vibrant.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Chloe Eau de Parfum* \\- The fresh floral opening may feel subtler.\n***\n\n**10. Benzyl Alcohol and Benzyl Salicylate**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Benzyl Alcohol\n* Benzyl Salicylate\n\n**What Changed:**  \nBoth are restricted to reduce allergenic risks.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Shalimar* \\- The powdery floral aspect will feel lighter.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue* \\- The floral accords will diminish slightly.\n***\n\n**Commercial and Consumer Implications**\n\n**For Perfume Enthusiasts:**\n\n* Iconic fragrances may feel less familiar as reformulations result in lighter, less impactful experiences.\n* Vintage batches of popular fragrances may gain value due to perceptible differences.\n\n**For the Industry:**\n\n* Niche brands face greater challenges due to cost pressures and limited resources for R&D on synthetic alternatives.\n* Innovation in synthetic molecules will accelerate as brands strive to balance compliance with olfactory quality.\n\n**Winners:** Clean, minimalist fragrances that align with these regulatory changes.\n\n**Losers:** Classic, mossy chypres and musky orientals reliant on restricted ingredients.\n***\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe IFRA 51st Amendment continues to raise the bar for safety and sustainability in perfumery. However, its restrictions challenge brands to balance regulatory compliance with preserving olfactory artistry. As the fragrance landscape evolves, the industry is likely to witness a renaissance of synthetic innovation, while consumers adjust to a lighter, cleaner fragrance experience.\n***\n\n*I’ve tried to break this down to the best of my abilities and understanding. Apologies if I’ve overlooked or missed anything. The example of perfumes changing is just a hypothesis, if companies manage to find like-for-like alternatives, you wouldn’t notice the difference. However, that has never been the case in the past.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE** - The intent here is simply to inform you, please, I repeat, **DO NOT** take this as some alarmist message designed to pressure you into buying something you don’t need. Perfumes are not a necessity. If you don’t get that vintage 1940s batch of Guerlain Vetiver, life will go on, and nothing will change.\n",

From a perfume experience perspective, manufacturers may comply with limitations by reducing levels of certain ingredients or substituting them with alternatives to meet regulatory requirements. This might affect the perfume experience positively, negatively, or not at all. However, manufacturers will likely prioritize maintaining the user experience, even with necessary reformulations.\n\n3. What should consumers do—use newly reformulated perfumes or stick to older ones? In my view, safety should always take precedence over the perfume experience.",

    "body": "I am a hairdresser and have been doing Brazilian hair blow-drying in a salon for years. Evaporation of the product during blow-drying burns my eyes, my throat burns, sometimes I feel a burning sensation in my chest, I get headaches and sometimes migraines (I have had migraines for many years, but I noticed that I get them more often when I do more Brazilian treatments) , even some customers shed tears and have to keep their eyes closed while blow-drying. \n\n   \nI’ve never thought too much about the toxicity of the product, so I googled a bit and found a few articles that write about the dangers of the contents of Brazilian treatment products, so I decided to share with you some of the substances found in CHOCOCOCO  and their side effects: \n\n* **Stearic Acid** \\- Inhalation may cause chemical pneumonitis  \n* **Behentrimonium chloride**  is considered toxic in concentrations of 0.1% and above and is suspected to cause skin and eye irritation. \n* **Phenoxyethanol** is actually very harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin, especially for breastfeeding or infants, It can also have an effect on the brain and central nervous system. If you are exposed to the product several times a day, every day, it can accumulate and probably have a bad effect on you. The American Cancer Society warns that formaldehyde is a known carcinogen. This means it can cause cancer or help cancer grow. Formaldehyde can also trigger other side effects. May be toxic in concentrations of 1% or less. Tests show that keratin treatments contain unsafe levels of formaldehyde and other chemicals. The FDA has received dozens of product complaints. One hairdresser, for example, said her treatments caused her migraines, blurred vision, sore throat, nausea and loss of smell. \n* **Glycolic acid**  shows some inhalation toxicity and can cause damage to the respiratory system, thymus and liver if they are present at very high levels over a long period of time. \n* **Coumarin**  is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys. \n* **Benzyl benzoate** side effects: irritations of the skin, eyes, nose and throat that can cause severe symptoms such as burning, nausea, vomiting and damage to the liver and kidneys. \n\n Some manufacturers claim that their keratin treatment does not contain **formaldehyde**, although there are studies that state the opposite. \n\nI would just like to briefly explain the process of Brazilian blow-drying for those who do not know: \n\n1. Hair is washed with a special shampoo (from the manufacturer, of course) \n2. The product is applied to dry hair, after 20 min it is blow-dried  \n3. Blow-drying causes a strong and visible evaporation of the product, the steam of which goes straight into my face (after blow-drying, the whole salon stinks of it, and is in the fog)  \n4. Hair is ironed at 220'C (which causes evaporation, but not in such quantities)  \n5. After the treatment, the hair is washed with special shampoos (Again, from the manufacturer, of course) \n\nI just want to state that I am not a chemist nor am I knowledgeable in chemistry in any way so I hope if someone is educated in this field I would be grateful if you would leave an opinion, also I do not know the percentage of these substances because their website does not state it.  \n\nHere is a list of all the ingredients in their product: \n\n Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Keratin / Hydrolysed Keratin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark / Leaf / Twig Extract, Calendula Officinalis (Marigold) Flower Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Behentrimonium Chloride, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii, Shea Butothera Evening Primrose) Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Salt), Dehydroacetic Acid, Aloe (Vera) Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Squalane, Ascorbic Acid Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Fragrance, Retinyl Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Glycolic Acid, Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate  \n\nThanks for reading and I will be grateful for any information and opinions <3",

        "body": "Hmm looking at that ingredients list I have to say it looks very innocent imo! I would have expected to see some hard core stuff in such product. Looking at Kerastase and Redken ingredients lists are generally way more frightening. I can’t see any really nasty things in the list- the nastiest ones are Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha- isomethyl ionone and benzoyl salicylate. These are fragrances that are more allergenic than when the list just says fragrance or perfume ( the manufacturer has to write the most allergenic fragrances separately in the list). But again- all of these will be found in almost any salon hair products with fragrance- and in a lot of “ natural” products as well. Phenoxyethanol is in basically every product you buy for hair, body or face. It acts as a stabilizer or as a preservative in products and became highly popular when parabens got unpopular. It is generally considered safe in small concentrations ( under 1%) for adults. It’s not considered safe for children under age 3 and should not be used if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. It has nothing to do with Formaldehyde as far as I know. Again- phenoxyethanol is in almost any product, even in the most sensitive no perfume no color brands. If you have to avoid it I think you would be limited to raw oils and the baby products.\nOverall I think that the list looks very descent. With some quite good stuff in it as well.\nAlso FYI I’m not educated in this, so I’m by no means an expert- it’s just a weird hobby😅\n\nEdit: I would also recommend wearing a mask and glasses when using. It looks safe when applying normally to hair but it’s not meant to be inhaled/ go in the eyes of course.",

        "body": "While you’re not wrong that the traditional Brazilian blowout is very toxic and releases formaldehyde when heat is applied to the hair the initial time at the salon, I am not reading anything specifically in those ingredients you listed that would cause this process. Glycolic acid would be suspected if it were high on the list, because glyxolic acid and ingredients with similar names may consist of one of the first ingredients in a “new and improved” Brazilian blowout (which still releases formaldehyde, they tend to just be sneakier about their product claims). The ingredient list you posted doesn’t have those ingredients, from what I can tell (but hey, I’m not a chemist, so if anyone is an expert in that field, please chime in). \n\nBehentrimonium chloride is an extremely popular ingredient in many hair conditioners, both drugstore branded and professional. I haven’t heard any recent research regarding controversy with the ingredient, but it very well could only be toxic under certain circumstances of which I can’t attest to (such as applying heat and keratin with it). \n\nThe first ingredient is water, the next is a harmless emulsifier (which allows the cream to keep it from separating), the third ingredient is an animal protein that comes from animal hair/hooves/horns. It’s not a scary ingredient, it’s just a cheap protein compared to keratin. Then keratin, followed by a lot of essential oils (which I wouldn’t be surprised if they were the culprit here). Fragrances, especially ones as volatile as essential oils, *especially* when you mix a buttload of them, generally do not play well with being heated against the hair at 450F. The rest of the ingredients are comprised of ingredients that make up less than ~1%, like tiny fragrance ingredients (linalool, limonine), and preservatives to keep it from spoilage (benzyl salicylate). \n\nI would definitely discontinue that brand, especially because unless there are extra ingredients/steps in the treatment aside from that ingredient list, I’m not sure I understand how they are meant to last for 3-6 months on anyone. None of the ingredients to form any sort of lasting keratin bond to the hair appear to be in that ingredient list, and the ones that could potentially play any role are in such minutes qualities to almost be meaningless. The glycolic acid being near the end of the ingredient list suggests it’s much more likely that it was a minor pH adjustment to the formula, not any life-changing chemical reaction. It seems as if your salon is getting ripped off by whoever is promoting their line of keratin treatments to you. The Cezanne line is one of the better ingredient lists out there, but I’ve only been doing a deep dive (as a current stylist) on this treatment since right before I did one on myself. I did the long lasting Cezanne treatment and there is absolutely no smell at any point in the process. You just have to make sure when you rinse the product, you don’t rinse too much of it out before you pat-dry and blow dry or there won’t be enough keratin still on the hair to bond correctly.",

The following is a translation and summarization of the article:\n\n[A study, published in the scientific journal *Healthcare*](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/1/63/htm), has come to the conclusion that a type of mouthwash manages to deactivate 99.9 percent of COVID-19 in the mouth between one and up to five hours.\n\nAs explained by the responsible of the investigation: \"The mouthwash destroys the lipid layer (the ‘skin’ of the virus) which means that, although the virus mutates, this substance continues to be effective. In the coming months, this mouthwash will begin to be manufactured and marketed on a large scale.\"\n\n\"I will not participate in this task, but we believe that it is very promising. It is a simple and inexpensive method to reduce the transmission of the virus and also to reduce infections in asymptomatic patients.\"  said the dentist.\n\nThe study carried out by scientists and universities from five countries (United States, Mexico, Colombia, Italy and Spain) shows that a mouthwash containing bioencapsulated D-limonene \"offers high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2\". The mouthwash in particular is a patent from the *Brix USA LLC* laboratory under the name *Xyntrus*. According to experts, \"it allows breaking the double lipid membrane of the COVID-19 virus with an efficiency greater than 99.99 percent.\"\n\n\\---END OF ARTICLE---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the virus can be deactivated by a literal mouthwash, is it really that dangerous as they say? **What do you think about this?**",

Rare Beauty is charging $20 for their lip oils while the Etude Glass Rouge Tint costs $7.21 over on YesStyle.com.\n\n\n\nRare Beauty Lip Oil:\nWater (Aqua/Eau), Diphenyl Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Octyldodecanol, Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Menthoxypropanediol, Ceteareth-20, Squalane, Fragrance (Parfum), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Stevioside, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Polyacrylate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Eugenol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Yellow 6 (CI 15985), Red 28 (CI 45410), Red 33 (CI 17200), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090)\n\n\n\nEtude Glass Rouge Tint:\nWater / Aqua / Eau, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Octyldodecanol, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene (Glycerin), Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, Phenoxyethanol, Squalane, Fragrance / Parfum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sunset Yellow FCF (CI 15985), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Fruit Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Red 33 (CI 17200), Red 28 (CI 45410)\n\n\nThe only differences I can find is that Rare Beauty added menthol to give a tingly feeling. And the oils are different. Rare Beauty uses jojoba and Sunflower oils. ETUDE uses Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Apricot Oil, Evening Primrose Oil and Sweet Almond Oil. Rare Beauty also uses Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, and Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract. While Etude just uses Mango Fruit Extract.\n\nHave you seen this before, where a company dupes another company's formula and then charges more for it?",

I'd rather have an inclusive shade range that's easier for me to purchase, even at a higher price. \n\nAlso I don't see how this etude house tint is any different to romand's juicy lasting tint, or glasting tint, or any tint that has a glassy finish. Yeah, rare beauty does have a lot of aesthetics taken from k-beauty but like everyone else is saying, it's probably not exactly the same. Not everything is meant to be a dupe.\n\nEdit: also most korean lip tints dry down, and do not feel like lip oils at all. The etude one isnt even described as an oil so i fail to see how comparable they are.",

    "body": "Hello pals! Today is the 1-year anniversary of my shop, [Morari!](https://morari.etsy.com/) It has been an incredible year, and I have learned so, so much — and I'm grateful to everybody who gave this new shop a chance! Over the last year, I've sunk almost all of my profits into new materials, perfumery texts, courses, and more, and I look forward to continuing my studies. I am dedicated to improving my craft in the coming years, and I am happy to have you alongside me! I've recently enrolled in Sarah McCartney's  Slow Scent School, and I can't wait to apply what I learn. My next long-term goal is to travel to LA and attend an intensive workshop at the Institute of Art and Olfaction. \n\nMoving on: I have lots of things to talk about, but let's start with the most exciting piece—there are six new scents up on my Etsy shop! \n\n**New Scents**\n\n 1. Green Tea Layer Cake\n\nNotes: Green Tea Cake, Rhubarb, Maple Cardamom Buttercream, Lemon Zest\n\nScent Description: For this one, I wanted to combine all of my favorite gourmand notes — green tea, rhubarb, maple, cardamom, and lemon! This perfume uses my buttery cake base, the same one that's used in Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble, but it has a green tea accord mixed in. There is also tart rhubarb to brighten it up - I'm imagining that there is some rhubarb filling in between the cake layers. I've also created a maple cardamom buttercream accord, which showcases cardamom essential oil and maple lactone. Lastly, there is some lemon essential oil and D-limonene, to represent lemon zest strewn atop the cake.\n\n2. Brown Sugar Pound Cake\n\n Notes: Brown Sugar Pound Cake, Dark Chocolate, Espresso, Peach Preserves\n\nScent Description: For Brown Sugar Pound Cake, rather than using my regular buttery cake base, I created a new pound cake base. It's heavier on ethyl maltol and vanillin, thereby amping the caramel/brown sugar aspect. I also made a dark chocolate and espresso ganache accord, which builds upon roasted cocoa and coffee bean oils. Lastly, I've included some of my Poached Peaches formula, to represent a dollop of peach preserves served alongside the cake. It's a decadent scent, but the sweetness is balanced by the bitterness of the dark chocolate and espresso. \n\n3. Tropical Almond Cake\n\n Notes: Almond Cake, Passionfruit Glaze, Orange Slices, Shredded Coconut\n\nScent Description: Tropical Almond Cake is built upon a new cake base, which uses a bit of benzaldehyde for a realistic almond aroma. There is also a passionfruit glaze accord, which showcases one of my favorite materials, Paradisimide! Then, I used some orange essential oil and limonene-D to represent orange slices topping the cake. Lastly, there is a trace amount of methyl laitone, which lends the scent of shredded coconut. Overall, it's a refreshing, tropical perfume with quite a juicy glaze! \n\n4. You Can't Hide From the Trees\n\nNotes: Grey Pine, Red Pine, Black Frankincense Absolute, Choya Raal, Black Hemlock Absolute, Guiacwood, Labdanum Absolute\n\nScent Description: The smell of an unwelcoming forest - one that's been abused by humans in the past and offers no comfort to travelers. There are no leaves left on the trees, just leering branches. No undergrowth in the forest, nothing to hide in. No matter where you are in this hostile wood, you can't hide from the trees.\n\nThis perfume uses a wide array of natural oils, but there is no green aspect to it. It's woody, smoky, and phenolic, meant to smell discomforting. \n\n5. Hinoki Woods\n\n Notes: Hinoki Wood, Petrichor, Patchouli, Palmarosa, Grey Pine, Bay Leaf, Treemoss, Caraway, Carrot Seed\n\nScent Description: A walk through the woods, with towering Hinoki on either side. The damp, mossy ground releases its fragrance with each step - this effect is accomplished with natural treemoss extract, a synthetic oakmoss accord built on veramoss, and geosmin, the chemical primarily responsible for the scent of petrichor. There is a subtle sweetness accomplished with palmarosa oil, and earthy complexity from carrot seed, caraway seed, and bay leaf. \n\n6. The Queen of Spices\n\n Notes: Cardamom, Black Frankincense Absolute, Pink Pepper, Ho Wood, Cinnamon Leaf, Sticky Dates\n\nScent Description: This perfume is meant to showcase the Queen of Spices: cardamom! This is considered a \"fresh\" spice rather than a warming one; although we might associate cardamom with warm things, like chai or baked goods, its oil actually has a somewhat cooling aroma. I've emphasized that with the use of pink pepper oil, which is another spice with a cooling aroma. The perfume also contains a sticky date accord, as well as black frankincense, Ho Wood, and cinnamon leaf - the latter balances the freshness of the other spices with its own round warmth. \n\n**Shipping Update**\n\nOkay, now it's time for some not-so-fun news. I've been having issues with international shipping; about 1 out of every 4 orders are being rejected at customs for containing class 3 hazardous liquids, even though I apply the correct tariff code for perfumes that contain no alcohol content. I've been paying for the additional international shipping labels out of my own pocket & resending everything, but it's been adding up. I don't want to start charging people crazy shipping rates that apply to alcohol-based products, especially since mine don't even contain alcohol, but I also can't afford to keep sending out packages and praying that customs pays attention to the tariff code. So, I am now only shipping to the US and Canada. I know this is very disappointing news, and I apologize. \n\n**Heart and Home Collection - End Date**\n\nMy Hearth and Home Collection was launched on August 15th, and I wanted to give everybody plenty of time to try out these seasonal scents. But it's time to make room for winter scents (I'll post more about those in November), so the collection will be coming down on November 15th. Some scents will be coming back next year (I might reformulate them for better complexity and performance), some will be added to my permanent collection, and some will be retired entirely. The ones that are retired will be added to my clearance section on November 15th, so you can get a full-sized bottle for 30% off. Once clearance bottles run out, you can still request a discontinued scent as a custom perfume, and it will be priced the same as a normal 5 ml bottle. As long as I have the materials to make it, I will be happy to do so!\n\nThese scents will be added to my general catalog: Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble, Snuggly\n\nThese scents will be coming back next fall: And She Walked With Me, Hearth and Home, Day After Halloween, Pumpkin Breath\n\nThese scents will be discontinued: Roasted Carrots, Autumn Potion, Year Round Fall\n\n**Reformulating Scents**\n\nAs I continue to improve my craft, I am reformulating some of my perfumes - for instance, Meadow Nymph has replaced Nymph and Chai Ultime has replaced Chai. If you prefer the old versions, you can request them as custom scents - just send me a message on Etsy and I'll make a private listing at the same price as a regular 5 ml bottle. \n\n**Miscellaneous Info**\n\n[Scent List](https://morariperfumes.wordpress.com/scent-list/)\n\n[How to Order a Custom Perfume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KofZCG8mDfhpvBfoeIRP3KqrDPwB3wwiBYqgcKVcFo0/edit)\n\nAnd that's all for news, I believe! Thank you once again for your wonderful support <3",

Very typical Gastro Pop euphoria, perfect for an evening wind down, setting myself up for a relaxed and blissful evening 🧘‍♀️ \n\nThe cure is bang on - squishy, beautiful moisture level, tacky, sticky, resinous, trich covered frosty goodness 😛\n\nIt produces lots of vapour and I didn’t need much to feel very well medicated 🌞\n\nI feel the Aussie MC landscape is changing with quality increasing and prices decreasing. I’m more than happy to pay whatever is needed to get fresh terpy buds but the price on the new Chemovar strains are a game changer for the OZ MC scene - high end craft cannabis at mid prices 🎉 I’m happy and so is my wallet!\n\nI’m keen to trial their Triangle Chem next which I think should be super effective for my insomnia 😴 \n\nAll the new Chemovar releases are such heavenly strain crosses, I love my fruit and candy and I already am in love with Bling Blaow and can’t wait for Facade (apples and bananas x eye candy)🍭 \n\nI would say this is one of the best and most enjoyable and terpiest strains available here, highly recommended!\n\nThank you Chemovar!!! 🙌🏽🎉🥰🔥🥳",

Looks fire!\n\nAlthough from my experience, whenever theres high THC (esp in the 30%) theres usually low terpenes  \nPlants need to dedicate resources in the growing phase to either high Cannabinoids or high terpenes.  \nSo either this is a mid 20s% THC with HIGH terps or lower Terps with HIGH thc. (ie Bazookas, HIGH THC low terps)  \nIn Australia, TGA allows 20% label variance for potency. IE you can label 30% and have technically 24% test result. As far as im aware no rules on Terpene claim %. (correct me if im wrong)  \nIn Canada, theres almost always inflated lab results for the rec market. \n\nHaving said that, im very keen to try this as it looks very well trimmed and cured.\n\nSource: i worked in a genetics lab \\\\ growing facility in Cali and Canada.  \np.s. no longer working in the industry but i am obviously still very passionate about it lol.  \np.p.s.

Before you cut a lemon, lime, or orange in half, grate the zest off the skin and save it to use as a seasoning for salad dressings, or as a garnish for your favorite cocktails. Any citrus rind can be boiled on the stove as a natural air freshener, and you can use leftover lemon peels, sprinkled with salt, to clean your kitchen and bathroom countertops. Or fill a glass container with citrus peels, which contain the natural solvent d-limonene, and cover them with white vinegar, another natural solvent. Let the mixture steep for about 2 weeks, strain out the peels, and you have a potent homemade all-purpose citrus-scented cleaner.",

    "body": "In Union Square in San Francisco, there’s an independent perfume store owned by an old French man.  He’s opinionated and a bit surly at times, but also kind and knowledgable.  I’ve heard him say “I don’t believe in notes in perfume.” (or something to that effect).  When I first heard it, I thought he was crazy.  Of course perfume has notes!  As I’ve gotten deeper into appreciating (and particularly making) perfume, I’ve started to realize that he might have a point.\n\nEveryone on the Internet talks about notes.  Perfume companies talk about notes.  They release marketing materials that list notes.  How could there not be notes?\n\nI’ll get to that, but first, a little bit of background:\n\n**What are fragrances actually made of?** \n\nFine Fragrances are generally made from a mixture of natural oils and aromachemicals diluted in alcohol (and possibly a touch of water).  Natural oils vary dramatically in price.  You can get an ounce of cedar oil for a couple of dollars, but an ounce on sandalwood could cost $100-$300 and an ounce of oud could cost $500-$2000.  Many commonly used oils are pretty inexpensive.  Bergamot (and other citruses), cedar, lavender, etc are all in the sub $10/oz range.  Natural oils are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals.  Lavender oil, for example, contains linalool, linalyl acetate, pinene, caryophyllene, myrcene, and a bunch of other aromachemicals, most of which are available on their own.\n\nAromachemicals, on the other hand, are generally a single molecule.  Often they are chemicals that occur in nature that have just been synthesized in a lab or extracted from some inexpensive plant that contains it.  Linalool, for example, can be synthesized in a lab very cheaply.  For those who insist on linalool that was extracted from a natural source, it’s often taken from mint.  Some aromachemicals come almost exclusively from natural sources, like limonene, which is found in the oil of citrus peels.  The orange juice industry provides enough orange peel waste to cheaply provide natural limonene to anyone who wants it.  \n\nOften, an expensive natural will be replaced with a synthetic version of it’s “active ingredient.”  This is both to save money and because the synthetic, single ingredient can often smell cleaner and better than the natural.  Often the part of a smell that people like (like tonka bean) is actually just one of the chemicals in it (coumarin).  In fact, most of the time when “tonka bean” is listed as a note it’s really just coumarin. Similarly, ambroxan is one of the main chemicals that makes up ambergris (though it smells quite different to my nose)\n\nSome aromachemicals aren’t found in nature at all.  calone 1951 (the basis of most aquatic fragrances), hedione, dihydro myrcenal, Iso E super and galaxolide are examples.  In fact, these non-natural aromachemicals are in large part what makes modern fragrances smell modern.  I would guess that greater than 95% of all fragrances to come out in the last 20 years have at least one or two of these if not all.\n\nSome big companies like IFF, Firmench and Givaudan also make proprietary blends of aromachemicals to either reproduce a natural scent or create a new one.  They may do this for several different reasons.  Here are some examples from the manufacturer Givaudan with the reasons they exist:\n\n* Bergamot replacement - a bergamot replacement that is more stable, longer lasting and more hypoallergenic\n* Oakmoss replacement - a replacement for natural oakmoss that is more hypoallergenic and allowed to be used at higher levels than natural oakmoss by the IFRA.\n* Ultrazur  - a blue, watery marine note that is very long lasting and tenacious. The smell is unlike anything in nature (but if you’ve smelled fabric softener, you know what it smells like)\n* Sampaquita - a jasmine note that is very true to the smell of the flower.  It smells MUCH more like the fresh flower than the actual extracted absolute does.\n* Oud Blend - a replacement oud that smells pretty good when blended and costs $37/oz instead of $700/oz.  Many “Oud fragrances” are actually using this\n\n**So what does this have to do with notes?**\n\nPeople seem to treat notes like they’re ingredients.  They’re not.\n\nHere’s the thing.  Most modern fragrances consist MOSTLY of aromachemicals.  Often they are aromachemicals than have a natural equivalent, but often they don’t.  When you look as Fragrantica and marketing materials, they don’t (or very rarely) list aromachemicals.  Even if they do exist in nature, what do you call it when you mix citral with limonene and some orange terpenes and a touch of linalool in a ratio that kind of smells like a pleasant orangey-lemon thing?  Maybe you just put “citrus” on the notes.  Maybe you call it “orange.”  Maybe you call it “lemon.” Regardless, it was a marketing decision, not the listing of an ingredient.  \n\nWhat about when a fragrance contains a bunch of ionone alpha and methyl ionone?  These are both major ingredients in violets…but by themselves just smell violet-ish.  How do you list that in the notes?  Probably as “violet” even though there are neither violet flowers nor an actual violet flower replacement (like Sampaquita is a jasmine replacement).  Someone else might mix some other violet like chemicals together in a way that is reminiscent of other aspects on a violet and call that violet too.\nFun fact:  It takes a million violet flowers to make 1 kg of concrete, so violet flower absolute hasn’t been made in commercial quantities since the 1800’s.  EVERY commercial violet flower fragrance you’ve ever smelled has probably been synthetic. Same for your grandmother.\n\nThe examples above seem to be somewhat reasonable at least.  The notes seem to have something to do with the ingredients.  Now, though, lets look at some other examples.  What happens when aromachemicals that aren’t found in nature are used heavily?  They either give a note for a natural that smells kind of, sort of vaguely close…or just ignore it completely.\n\nTerre d’Hermes and A&F Fierce both have fragrance bases that are about 50% (HALF!) Iso E Super.  Where is that on the note listing?  What about when something smells strongly of dihydro myrcenal?  They just don’t list it. Or ambroxan.  Holy crap.  Once you know what ambroxan smells like, you can smell the person who spritzed themselves with Cool Water or Light Blue 8 hours ago..but it doesn’t show up on any of the note listings.  CK One should have Hedione listed as a prominent note.  It’s something like >20% of the fragrance base, but nope, nowhere to be found in the note listings\n\nQuite often the most defining characteristics of a fragrance don’t show up in the note listings, particularly if they don’t have  a familiar analog for the average person.\n\nMany traditional perfumery notes are made up entirely as well.  “Amber” is traditionally a blend of vanilla, labdanum, styrax and benzoin, not the petrified tree sap.  “Fougere” is the was someone imagined a fern should smell, but it’s really a mixture of oak moss, coumarin and lavender.  The “Leather” smell is a standardized artificial smell that is added to tanned animal products, originally to hide the smell of urine used in tanning.  It’s made of birch, cade, styrax, castoreum and a bunch of other stuff.\n\n**So what does all this mean for notes?**\n\nIt means that notes are not a list of ingredients.  They sometimes bear a resemblance to the ingredients in a fragrance, but not always.  They are the products of marketing people.  They are more an indication of the impressions that the perfume house wants you to have than an indication of how the fragrance actually smells.\n\nYou’ll notice that you can have 2 fragrances with very different notes that everyone says smell alike and 2 fragrances with almost identical notes that smell very differently.  \n\nIf you took natural oils for every note listed in Gucci Envy, or Light Blue or Green Irish Tweed and spent a lifetime mixing them you would never be able to create anything that smelled even close to the original because most of the ingredients that define it as a scent aren’t listed anywhere in the notes\n\nFragrance notes can definitely be useful, but that doesn’t mean that they’re accurate.\n\n**What if I want to learn about how these aromachemicals actually smell?  The REAL notes that make up fragrances…**\n\n[The Perfumer’s Apprentice sells a kit](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-6631-perfumery-notes-kit.aspx) for this exact purpose.\n",

The other scents become background noise and we just ignore them, while others  become important because we like them or have a personal experience  that enhances that particular odor. \n\nFinally I wonder is there a blog or something where amateur perfumers share various recipes.

    "body": "Basic concept and science of super juice.\n\nAs we see a noticeable jump in interest, I thought I'd cover the basics here for people who are experimenting with super juice. I hope this isn’t obvious to everyone, as I’ve seen many questions popping up.\n\nI started thinking about the super juice, citrus aid concept over the summer of 2020. I started by watching [Nickle's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiNMAm42C8U), after having [read the work](https://www.corpserevived.com/post/maximizing-citrus-part-1-oleo-saccharums-cordials) of Brian Tasch of Pouring Ribbons (the same gent that gave us the [massive vermouth tasting guide](https://www.corpserevived.com/spirited-guides)). I've been experimenting since May/June of last year.\n\nWe use the hydrophilic properties of the crystallized acids(s) to pull the essential oils (aromatics, limonene, terpenes, etc.) from the citrus, just the same as sugar in oleo-saccharum. This is what makes the oleo-citrate taste like juice instead of just acidified water. Essentially, what we're doing is flavoring Dave Arnold's concept of acid solutions with the essential oil and other organic compounds from the citrus peel.\n\nUp to 75% of ascorbic acid (aka vitamin C) in citrus is found in the peel. Along with other organic compounds and material, when we blend the peel and water we are putting much of the ascorbic into solution. This adds to the flavor profile. It is the antioxidant effects of ascorbic and citric acids, along with the lower levels of organic matter that increase the longevity of both oleo-citrate / super juice.\n\nLet's analyze the differences in published \"recipes\", using super lime juice as an example.\n\nNickle Morris, Zach Zosche and Educated Barfly's recipes are very similar. The finished makeup of the oleo-citrate, per liter, works out to (using 100-120g of peel) 45g citric and 8g malic. Kevin Kos' ratios work out, per liter, to (using 60g of peel) 38.8g of citric and 19.4g of malic. As you can see, that's a big difference and is a simple product of preferences in taste. Kevin leans far heavier on malic acid and much less on the natural taste of lime. Some people are put off by strong essential oil flavors.\n\nAlso notice the high acid content in most orange oleo-citrate recipes. This is an attempt of acid-balancing to lemon/lime levels. That's perfectly fine if that's what we want. If what we want is more natural tasting super juice, we have to cut back to natural levels of acidification.\n\nLet's take a look at the average citric and malic acid content in our typical citrus juices.\n\nLemon contains (per liter): 85g of citric and 1g of malic.\n\nLime contains: 62g and 6.1g.\n\nOrange contains: 13g and 1g.\n\nGrapefruit contains: 20g and 2g.\n\nThese figures are taken from the International Journal of Life Sciences. However, I've seen acid content, from other high-quality sources, listed all over the place, with malic as high as 6 g for lemon, 8 g for orange, and 6 g for grapefruit and much lower citric content for lemon and lime.\n\nFor my experimental purposes, I've normalized thus far to (per liter):\n\nLemon: 50g citric and 3g malic\n\nLime: 45g and 8g\n\nOrange: 15g and 6g\n\nGrapefruit: 25g and 4g\n\nOur recipes should start with the acid to water ratio, which determines the overall acidity of the oleo-citrate. Then we decide just how much peel is necessary to flavor the recipe to our liking. If we want to acid balance our orange and grapefruit oleo-citrates, all we need do is bump acid levels (primarily citric) to that of lemon/lime. If we want to acid balance our super juice to compensate for the addition of natural juice, all we need do is further bump acid levels by appropriate amounts. i.e. If we add 250 ml of orange or grapefruit juice, we add an additional 8g or 6g of citric acid, respectively. Understand that, just like cocktails, the amounts of all ingredients are variable to your individual taste/preferences.\n\nThe biggest difference in grapefruit juice is the presence of glutamic acid. To dial in our super juice, all we need do is add 3g of monosodium glutamate (MSG) per 1 liter oleo-citrate recipe. This should form the appropriate amount of glutamic necessary.\n\nI hope this answers some questions people are having about oleo-citrate and super juice. It really is a game changer in the world of cocktailing. We’re still in the process of fine-tuning ratios, but pretty happy where things are currently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Here's a video that goes into a bit of history and shows how this concept is not entirely new.\n\n[8x The Juice 10x The Flavour - Cocktail Super Juice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Tq52tQfBAE)\n\nEdit-03/13/22: Over the weekend, we updated acid content for our lemon and lime oleo-citrates. Lemon only gets 65 g/l of citric. Lime gets 55 g/l of citric and 8 g/l of malic. Both are still utilizing 100 g of peel per liter of water. I think this is where we will live for the foreseeable future.",

I think you've pretty much nailed the acidity level from my limited experience, so is the difference made up from the ascorbic acid in the peels?\n\nThe other quick observation I have is that many papers on the subject discuss really *massive* acidity differences in cultivars of the same fruit.  Also, the balance between citric and malic acid seems to be all over the map.  Oranges can go from 10:1 citric:malic all the way down to 2:1.  Sweet limes often have *more* malic acid than citric acid.  It *appears* that you have a fair amount of leeway in selecting an acid ratio that you prefer, which would be nice if true.",

    "body": "RRP Price: $165.\nSize: 10g.\nPer MG: $0.07.\nOrigin: Winlaw BC, Canada. \nCultivator: Kootenay Quantum.\nPlant Species: Sativa Dominant. \nTHC: 25%.\nCBD: <1%.\nLineage: Dark Matter x Cali Diesel x God. \n\nTotal Terpenes: 3.47%\nDominant Terpenes: Terpinolene (1.20%), Farnesene (0.75%), Trans-Caryophyllene (0.40%) & Ocimene (0.31%), Myrcene (0.30%).\n\nlet’s start with the Visuals, the box it comes in. The colours are mainly Blue and white giving it that fresh clean look which also shows in the name Crystal and how the text and colours resemble ice or something shiny ✨. The symbols on the box give me a space type of vibe diamonds in the sky which fits in nicely with the two Dark Matter & God Lineage in the strain. \n\nI Opened up the box to get the jar out which I always find satisfying holding the CraftBotanics and SingleEstate jars, comes in a glass jar which is always nice for storage. So opening the Jar I got hit with a very strong smell which I have never smelt in a strain before and the name that came to mind was a sweet champagne. Now I don’t drink and especially wine but I have tried Preseco in the past and all I can say is it describes the strain to a T. \n\nFine bottles of Prosecco offer up aromas of tropical fruits, banana cream, hazelnut, vanilla, and honeycomb. The Tropical Aroma is coming from Terpinolene & Ocimene and I’m also getting the same taste I was getting from  Auratherapeutics Apples & Bananas. The Crisp apple taste would be coming from Farnesene and maybe the banana flavour from a max of the terpenes Caryophyllene, limonene and Alpha-Bisabolol bringing a nutty fruity creaminess which could convert to a banana essence possibly.\n\nSo been changing the temps of my ball vape just as the Taroma Lite Plus holds 300-310 rubies and can hold allot of heat even at low temps, meaning I can go lower than usual and still get thick vapour, flavour and good extraction. So I changed my temp to 515 and do heat soaks. I grinded up and loaded a small bowl (smaller are better). I placed the head in the titanium bowl and let it heat soak till the temp dropped to 480 and back up to 508 and I start hitting it slow, slowly increasing how much I pull till I reach around 518. Usually it’s basically extracted it all and I’ll go in for a small second hit just to finish up. \n\nThe Flavour was how I describe the aroma, a Sweet Tropical Champagne with after tones of Apples and Cream Bananas, very unique and not a mix I’ve ever had before. Now time for the effects, this strain is a Sativa and from the mix of Terpenes I found this strain to be almost creeping into the hybrid feel but still retains its Sativa feeling. The High terpinolene produced a euphoric mind high, enhanced my mood and provided an energetic, active feeling. Although I did feel the sedative side of terpinolene mixing with myrcene which is why I said it had a hybrid feel to it aswell. \n\nFarnesene’s Terp benefits are reducing inflammation, relieving pain, easing anxiety, promoting relaxation ect ect there’s plenty of benefits that come with them but these are the ones I noticed helping me especially after a long day out and I come back and it’s still day time out and I don’t feel like being tired and still wish to be active it allows me to be more energised and productive whilst easing my pain, anxiety and also reducing any inflammation I may have especially since I dislocated my elbow 5-7weeks ago I still have a swollen arm so it helps allot. \n\nOverall I give this a 9.9 out of 10, the most unique flavours I’ve came across, I really enjoy the effects and how it works for me with my day to day activities. I do know this strain has been shortlisted to Win awards so I would 100% try this strain is your into your Tropical Terpinolene Sativa Strains. ",

It's specifically for sensitive skin, and First Aid Beauty is the bomb in general for me. I wear it on top of my usual moisturizer/sunscreen with no other products most frequently, so this sounds like it could work for you too. It gives a glowy but not oily vibe that I love, but if you don't want any glow or shine, you can set it lightly with a translucent powder on top. It is a little pricey, but you only need a tiny bit (pea-sized) so one tube lasts me a long time.\n\nI have tried both the NYX and Smashbox primers you mentioned and they were okay. I'd pick NYX over Smashbox purely for the price point tbh, or try to get sample sizes so you can try them out without wasting your money. I did have some issues with them not playing well with my makeup at the time, but since you're planning on wearing them alone they may work better for you. Good luck!",

Just get a bit with your finger and sweep it into yourself skin on CLEAN skin, or after moisturizer/sunscreen has completely absorbed (they mention this on the box instructions too which is helpful) I personally would not tap it, literally just swipe it in one direction, I don’t go back in forth which is why I was hesitant to write “rubbing” but I essentially rub it on in one direction (going outward from my nose and up towards my forehead), it’s so good and doesn’t break me out ever. Just use a good oil cleanser or makeup eraser  (mine are $14 for a pack of 5 off Amazon) to remove or double cleanse it after the day is done which you should be doing anyways. No frills, just the good stuff to fill your pores in. Note: this has different types of silicones as almost all pore fillers do as that’s how u effectively fill pores in. If you want something without silicones, wet n wild has one called the impossible primer or something that claims to do something for this without silicones and is $6ish dollars. Up to you!",

    "body": "Mac doughnuts is an indica dom hybrid at 27% THC and 2.99% terps with the dominant terps being myrcene, linalool,  limonene and B-caryophyllene.\n\nThe cultivator is FN Canna in BC Canada which is the first indigenous based cultivation company, fusing traditional indigenous wisdom with the latest agricultural advances. It is based on principles of community driven cultivation - focused on uplifting indigenous communities. I love the story behind this company and so was super keen to support West Coast Palms bringing out strains with such an ethical source with a moving story. ✌️\n\nMAC doughnuts is a cross between the legendary miracle alien cookies x powdered donuts 🍩 and a very exciting new release for the many MAC lovers in our community. \n\nOpening the tub I was hit by powerful and enticing sweet and fruity notes with elements of baked goods and citrus, sugar and spice 🥰 def a tub I keep smelling to identify the complex and layered notes. Yum!\n\nThe taste in my vape beautifully translates the above mentioned notes with an addition of sweet gas on the exhale. There is a robust amount of Vapor and I have found 185-195 a sweet spot for the taste and effects. \n\nVisually the buds are very appealing. Very dense and squishy and full of life. The buds are extremely frosty and sticky and have a milky hue with orange pistils. Visually it’s beautiful and very fresh. Buds are mostly medium sized. It grinds up very fluffy, just lovely ☺️ \n\nMAC doughnuts is hand picked, hand trimmed, hand packed, Coco + LED, hang dried and cold cured 🏆 all the hallmarks of craft cannabis ✅\n\nThe effects are quick with a strong onset of euphoria and upbeat vibes. This is highly recommended for anyone looking to improve their mood and well being. It’s powerful and euphoric high is great for lifting my mood and boosting my energy levels, and I would place it in my late afternoon/evening rotation for mood boost and relaxation. I find the effects to have great legs and the initial mood boost lasted at least two hours before noticing any effects wearing off ☮️ \n\nThis is highly recommended for those seeking a very cerebral experience, and for me it has balanced hybrid effects which makes it quite versatile.\n\nThis is a very unique and exciting new release, and for $130 10g it’s a very high end craft offering at a very reasonable price.\n\nI have a script for West Coast Palms BlackBerry Pie and am very much looking forward to that being released this coming week.\n\nFri-yay is for MAC Doughnuts, have a lovely weekend MCOZ 🌿💚🫶🏽\n\n",

This is a great grown, tasty, and effective day smoke for me 😋  lovely terps kinda similar to the white hot guava but less citrus more fizziness if that makes sense....\ndefinitely try, it's a banga...Nd for $105 at the best pharmacy going around Heathershaws of course( thanks Jenny and Gav will help you out to the best of their ability  these guys are extremely knowledgeable and helpful and I couldn't ask for anything more 😊❤️❤️\n\nReally glad someone is getting some use from the flower tho 🙌👌👌",

Upon opening I was hit with a sweet, candy, earthy smell (I lost most of my sense of smell and taste sure to covid so I'm sure there's more going on smell wise!)\n\nIt's a Purple Candy Kush x OG Kush x Chemdawg.\n\nThe buds are large and seem to all be tops and there is zero stem. The buds themselves are quite dense and a little sticky but fluffed up really well in the grinder. \n\nAs you can see from the photos the purple hue is strong in this tub! It's quite frosty too. When you hold it to the light you can see all of the golden hairs in it too which look quite beautiful I thought 😊\n\nIts prominent terpenes include Caryophyllene, Limonene, and Humulene, contributing to its unique aromatic profile. High Caryophyllene, know for its anxiolytic properties and increasing body relaxation helping to stimulate the cannabis receptors - from CannaReview\n\nSmoking it in a bong the smoke is very smooth and tastes quite floral to me. The immediate effect is heady, my brain felt nice and warm and fuzzy and now it's becoming a nice body relax after a few cones. This was prescribed as an afternoon flower and I think it's great for that because it's so relaxing but I feel like I can still get stuff done...like actually writing full sentences 😂 I'm about to try the Delta1 25% indica tonight so hopefully that will follow on nicely from the Purple Raine!\n\nI was prescribed this through Horizon from Dr Jason Ratcliffe who is a great doctor, really open and warm and really good product knowledge. \n\nThis is my first ever review so I hope it's got some info that interests some people!",

Due to the antioxidant effects of hesperidin and its derivatives, the cardioprotective and anti-cancer effects of these compounds have been widely reviewed. Although the biological activities of hesperidin in neurodegenerative diseases have been evaluated, its potential involvement in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including autoimmune demyelinating disease, requires further investigation in terms of the underlying mechanisms.

Two studies tried to explain the cancer preventive mechanisms of limonene and found limonene could restore the antioxidant capacity or immune functions that were impaired by cancer. These results supported the potential applicability of limonene on inhibiting cancer development, yet the real-world applicability on human requires more research and evaluation through clinical studies.\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2021.725077/full",

    "body": "—INTRODUCTION—\n\nPeople start looking into no-, low-, and natural-poo for a variety of reasons.  For whatever reason, we do have a tendency to let our beliefs and emotional reactions (feels) get in the way of facts (reals).\n\nThere’s a link in the sidebar to a page about “Essential Oils in Haircare”.  This set off crazy warning bells: essential oils are not something with which to be tinkering around.  This is about 7000 times more true if they are being used topically, rather than for aromatherapy, which is how the linked website (and many of this subreddit’s users) recommend using them.\n\nJust because something is “natural” or derived from a plant does not mean it’s a-okay for your skin.  There’s no market out there for poison ivy tea rinses, after all.  I want to work through (for now) the oils specifically mentioned on the linked page, since that is what the subreddit “advocates” or is, at least, what most users will find when looking into essential oil use.\n\n—THE LINE-UP—\n\nBASIL: first up, this essential oil has some compounds that are going to be old friends by the time we get through this: linalool and eugenol.  This are BOTH documented irritants that you should avoid in any skin care product. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/basil-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/linalool)\n\nCHAMOMILE: this one checks out; it doesn’t appear to be widely irritating in general, though some people with allergies to the daisy family may have issues. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/chamomile)\n\nCEDARWOOD: this is a fragrance, and like many fragrances, can be irritating and allergenic.  There is also, apparently, some research which found it to cause tumors on mouse skin.  The evidence is far, far from conclusive, and even if there were more studies with similar results, “correlation is not causation” would still apply.  However, if you’re going to freak out about parabens or whatever, it doesn’t make sense to use cedarwood oil. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/cedarwood)\n\nCLARY SAGE: this is tagged with the Risk Number* R38, marking it as irritating to the skin.  Don’t put it on your scalp, fer Pete’s sake. (http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB9340183.htm)\n\nEUCALYPTUS: this is a fragrant oil which, as the sidbar-linked website says, may well have some anti-fungal and anti-microbial effects.  HOWEVER, some of its components are known irritants.  \"Truly a mixed bag, because this oil, like rosemary oil, is one that has benefits and risks. Because the risks are primarily with topical application to skin, eucalyptus oil is an ingredient to avoid” (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eucalyptus-oil)\n\nLAVENDER:  STOOOOOOOOOOOOP putting lavender essential oil anywhere near your skin. The “tingling” feeling that many people describe isn’t lavender oil stimulating your bloodflow or anything, it’s the oil irritating and damaging your skin.  You do NOT want to experience tingling with any product you apply topically: it is your body sending you distress signals.  Lavender is so, so misunderstood, so I’m going to quote the whole article:  \n\n\"Of particular concern is the lavender oil, which smells great but causes havoc on skin. Research indicates that components of lavender, specifically linalool, can be cytotoxic, which means that topical application causes skin-cell death (Source: Cell Proliferation, June 2004, pages 221–229). Lavender leaves contain camphor, which is a known skin irritant. Because the fragrance constituents in lavender oil oxidize when exposed to air, lavender oil is a pro-oxidant, and this enhanced oxidation increases its irritancy on skin (Source: Contact Dermatitis, September 2008, pages 143–150). Lavender oil is the most potent form, and even small amounts of it (0.25% or less) are problematic. Although it’s fine as an aromatherapy agent for inhalation or relaxation, it is a must to avoid in skin-care products. (Sources: Psychiatry Research, February 2007, pages 89–96; and www.naturaldatabase.com).\"\n\n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/bio-oil/_/Bio-Oil)\n\nLEMON: this provides no demonstrated skin care benefits, but can be both irritating and photo toxic, i.e. reactions may result following exposure to sunlight.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemon-oil)\n\nLEMONGRASS: this is another fragrant, volatile oil which contains the same compounds that make lemon oil (above) irritating to the skin. ( http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemongrass-oil)\n\nMYRRH: another one that contains limonene, an irritant also found in the two oils above, as well as pinene (see “volatile oil\" description below) and eugenol, which you also don’t want on your body. (http://www.baseformula.com/product.php/6670/myrrh-essential-oil), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol)\n\nPATCHOULI: this is derived from mint, can sensitize skin, and contains eugenol (see myrrh, above) which is an irritant.  Patchouli is considered a “counter irritant”, for which see below for a full explanation. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/patchouli)\n\nPEPPERMINT: it’s another counter-irritant; move along. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/peppermint)\n\nROSEMARY: this one kind of almost barely checks out.  In very, very small quantities rosemary EXTRACT can be okay, but if you look at the main constituents of rosemary OIL, it’s a whole lot of known irritants: pinene, borneol, linalol, camphor, etc. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/rosemary-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/antioxidants/rosemary-extract)\n\nSAGE: I feel like this is starting to get repetitive: it’s a fragrant oil, and all the usual, skin-annoying compounds are there, including camphor.  Nope.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/sage-extract)\n\nTEA TREE: Fiiiiiiiiiinally!  This one kind of checks out too!  It can have anti-inflammatory effects and seems effective at treating certain skin conditions.  However, that doesn’t mean you should go whapping it all over your head: it still contains components that can cause issues, so it should STILL be treated with extreme caution.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/tea-tree-oil1)\n\nTHYME: once again, fragrance compounds found in thyme oil are undesirable on your skin.  Billionth verse, same as the first, no?  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/thyme-oil)\n\nYLANG YLANG: allllllllllll together now!  It’s a fragrant oil made up of compounds known to cause skin issues!  Skip it!  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/ylang-ylang)\n\n—IN CONCLUSION—\n\nMany people who avoid shampoo do so because they feel it contains too many “harsh” or “irritating” chemicals.  Swapping out a rigorously-tested, carefully-formulated shampoo only to start smearing essential oils (chemicals) over your head is, however, nonsensical.  Not that you can’t do it, of course; it’s your body.  If, however, you’re going to invoke science in defense of any part of your regime (often done in no-poo-land), why not apply that standard consistently?  “Diluting” these oils with carriers may help, but these compounds can be problematic for skin even in tiny quantities in professionally-made products.  If you’re avoiding shampoo to limit your exposure to chemicals and irritants, why risk the above-listed essential oils\n\n—ADDITIONAL NOTES AND DEFINITIONS—\n\nVOLATILE OIL: \"Group of volatile fluids derived primarily from plants and used in cosmetics primarily as fragrant additives. These components most often include a mix of alcohols, ketones, phenols, linalool, borneol, terpenes, camphor, pinene, acids, ethers, aldehydes, and sulfur, all of which have extremely irritating and sensitizing effects on skin.” (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/volatile-oil)\n\nCOUNTER-IRRITANT: \"Ingredients such as menthol, peppermint, camphor, and mint are counter-irritants (Sources: Archives of Dermatologic Research, May 1996, pages 245–248; and Code of Federal Regulations Title 21—Food and Drugs, revised April 1, 2001, CITE: 21CFR310.545, www.fda.gov). Counter-irritants are used to induce local inflammation for the purpose of relieving inflammation in deeper or adjacent tissues. In other words, they substitute one kind of inflammation for another, which is never good for skin. Irritation or inflammation, no matter what causes it or how it happens, impairs the skin’s immune and healing response (Source: Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology, November–December 2000, pages 358–371). And although your skin may not show it or doesn’t react in an irritated fashion, if you apply irritants to your skin the damage is still taking place and is ongoing, so it adds up over time (Source: Skin Research and Technology, November 2001, pages 227–237).”  \n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/counter-irritant)\n\nRISK NUMBERS: an explanation can be found here (https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/newsletter/essential_oils_handle_with_care.php)\n",

This is a true statement, and I'm glad someone is pointing this out.\n\nThat said, I wanted to point out a couple of things to anyone who may still read this thread.  What makes something toxic or damaging is amount, and that can be said for everything ranging from resiniferatoxin to normal water.  While there are definitely going to be stupid or ignorant people that use essential oils in an unsafe manner, most of them have safe levels associated with use.  In other words, diluted down sufficiently, there's nothing on the list you've provided that *can't* be safely used for lotions, shampoos, and bath oils, and some, like lavender, are *so* safe that they're regularly used in baby lotions.  \n\nEveryone isn't going to be rolling to EO use with a solid chemistry background, so mentioning that certain things cause sensitization (like the wood oils) more rapidly than others is definitely worth noting.  But even with that in mind, almost everything you listed makes regular appearances in commercial perfumes, so they've been tried and tested in the population.  \n\nLastly, I wanted to point out that your concept of skin irritant is a little off.  Inducing local inflammation isn't the horrible thing you seem to think it is, in fact, products containing a number of the ingredients above are recommended for multiple-times-daily use by doctors for treatment of pain (like from sore muscles and arthritis).  The proportion of eugenol and linalool and other potentially irritating compounds is so low in most of the ones you've listed that dilution is sufficient to all but eliminate risk.  The remaining risk is the same for any new scented product you'd buy, including tested deodorant soaps and shampoos.  \n\nJust don't use EO's undiluted, ever, and follow established protocols for reduction, and people will be fine including them in whatever homemade hair or skin tonic they wish.",

Good Body effect and decent head effect a little bit behind the eyes not much tho.\n\n- Pain Management: Body relaxing so can help with pain management\n\n- Sleep: Haven’t tested for sleep will see how it goes\n\n- Appetite stimulant: Made me pretty hungry\n\n- Relaxation: I feel it’s pretty relaxing for a hybrid I like the effect so far\n\n- Concentration: I definitely still feel concentrated not zoned out or anything\n\n- Mood: Happy, Relaxed, Chilled\n\n- Rotation/Repeat Buy: Definitely repeat buy but unsure yet if this will fit into rotation I just really love the taste of the Candy Blast so much more as that works well for both day and arvo like this does. \n\n- Notes/comments: This is some really STANKY medical. Probably one of the smelliest and fresh to touch I’ve come across lately, very frosty can feel it on your fingers, really like the smell and the taste is quite nice and pungent in both. I think this will definitely grow on me.\n\n(Completely my opinion and everyone reacts differently to cannabis, what I might, smell, taste and effect may be completely different to the next person.)\n\nThanks everyone, Happy Long Weekend! 💚",

Honestly I would never pick this as MAC just based off my experience with the Alfie stuff. MAC/MAC-1 has a very interesting backstory which I went over in my Alfie MAC-1 review. Watermelon OG is a cross between Watermelon Zkittlez and Tahoe Hydro OG, a lineage filled with Kush. Never thought my favourite strain would end up being both a Kush and Cookies cross. Maybe I should hand in my anti-GSC flair.\n\nCountry of origin: Avant Brands from BC Canada\n\nGrowing conditions: Indoor\n\nIrradiation: Unknown, probably gamma\n\nLook: Round, chunky nugs with round/swollen calyx and vibrant orange/brown pistils. Strong layer of trichomes. no stems, leaves or shake. Some tiny tiny barely developed hermie seeds. Quite dry, though with some give and residual stickiness when nugs are broken apart. Batch 6 is greener than 7.\n\nTerpenes: Batch 6 - 1.942%. Batch 7 - 2.261%. Terpinolene, Farnesene, Caryophyllene, Limonene, Pinene\n\nSmell volume: Subdued, not very loud. Halfway to being dead. Both batches similar smell strength & profile, 7 being perhaps slightly more pungent than 6 but not by much (10% extra terps). Earlier batches seem better too with 0001 coming in at a whopping 3.6%.\n\nSmell pleasure: This is it. One smell of this and I knew this was the strain for me. Complex aroma despite being muted. Lemon sherbert, lime cordial, mango, pine, peach, and watermelon. Very unique smell with its peach/watermelon aroma, never had these flavours in cannabis before. This strain smells the least like weed out of all the strains I've tried, almost pure fruit. Very little \"dank\"/weed smell. I wonder if someone new to weed would even recognise this as being weed. It does have an acrid sort of taste on the inhale that I was expecting to enjoy but was a bit overbearing initially through my Xmax. much prefer the aroma of conduction vapes. \n\nBased on smell alone this has what I would consider to be a perfect terpene profile. Props to the breeder, what a magical strain.\n\nConditions treated: Depression, lack of appetite\n\nEffect: Clearheaded euphoria. Just the ticket. This ticks all my boxes - functional, happy, hungry, no worries. Extremely versatile, easily the most versatile strain I've had yet. Meshes with any scenario or time of day. It's balanced enough that I've been enjoying this both first thing in the morning and before bed. Few strains don't make me anxious. No worries at all on this one, I never feel high. Somehow uplifting and relaxing without making me lethargic. I picked up this strain for the first time when I was visiting Melbourne a couple months ago and it allowed me to eat as much food as I wanted, ate enough cheese for a lifetime I think. While it does make me hungry it isn't as powerful of an appetite stimulant as say Delahaze or Jade, which I've been enjoying as this one doesn't wake me up at 4am ravenous like the other 2. The only critique I have is that it is lacking some richness in effect due to being dry and having lost terpenes. \nIf you're chasing a high, I would look elsewhere. I feel sober on this even when my eyes are red. Perfect for me but perhaps lacking for those that need something mental like for sleep. This one has a decently high CBGA% and I've heard others comment on this being effective for their pain. Unfortunately I can't comment as I never notice pain relief from high THC strains.\n\nBatch #: 0006 & 0007 Expiry: 12/23\n\nSimilar strains: Unique\n\nRATING:\n\nLook: 8.5/10\n\nSmell volume: 4/10\n\nSmell pleasure: 9.5/10\n\nSmell total: 6.8/10\n\nEffect: 8.5/10\n\nTOTAL: 7.5/10\n\nThis is still my favourite strain 2 months later. Most strains I get sick of within 2 weeks and need to swap out to maintain efficacy. Took me closer to 3-4 weeks to tire of this, which I resolved by rotating with Delahaze and SC01.",

    "body": "Grape Stank is a cross between (Garlicn Grove x Grape Gasoline) 25% THC & total terps reading @ 4.14% Top 3 Dominant terps are: Myrcene, Teripinolene & Limonene.\n\n🍃INFO: RRP: $165/10g EXP: 20-APR-2026 B/N: B672\n\n🍃APPEAL/PACKAGING: My glass jar came in a black and gold box giving a real premium feel imo love the luxurious look. the tub looks awesome too on top of the great info that it all provides down to the flowering time etc. The nugs are very unique, they are skinny long. trichome coverage is beautiful, just as the colours are. dark green / purplish with light green throughout.\n\n🍃CURE: This one is decently sticky with an and sticks to your fingers when grinding up. it has a decent cure too, not near dry at all. grinds up fluffy and beautifully.\n\n🍃SMELL/AROMA: It’s a stinky one for sure, especially when you first crack the tub! A funky citrus smell with slight garlic and grapes comes through, another one of those flowers that have smells in layers. it mainly burped out to have a funky herbal citrus smell with slight garlic and grapes again. (Like someone even said it smells like the inside of a tennis ball, my guy you are right. you can totally get that funnily enough)\n\n🍃TASTE: When vaped the taste came through with more herbal and citrus notes compared to the others. but still get floral & a funky taste (not in a bad way). not the best tasting imo was hoping the translation was better. however through a dry pull on a J it tastes quite similar even get the garlicy notes.\n\n🍃EFFECTS: I found this flower to be great for afternoon / nighttime use. it’s can be a bit sedating depending on consumption. also it’s very relaxing and euphoric mostly body vibes for me. stress melts away, also found a slight amount of pain relief with this strain. \n\n🍃TLDR/OVERALL: Overall this flower actually ticked a lot of boxes and i wasn’t expecting it to. It’s a great nighttime flower you get good sleep or relaxation out of it. such a stinky nice flower with funky notes, the cure also is great and decently sticky. i didn’t expect it to tick so many boxes mainly due to how it looked and hearing complaints about bazookas and gas cake etc but this one was great and has intrigued me to try others. (open to other mediquest Suggestions below 👇)\n\n📦APPEAL/PACKAGING 9.5/10\n\n💦CURE 9/10\n\n👃🏻SMELL/AROMA 9/10\n\n👅TASTE 7.5/10\n\n🌬️EFFECTS 9/10\n\n🍁OVERALL 44/50 👌\n",

    "body": "Ladies and gentlemen what we have here is some legit PRIMO !!\n\nLet’s start with a little bit about the growers of this immaculate flower “Kootenay Quantum” \nThey were established in 2023, operating as a licensed cultivator in the cannabis industry, holding a micro license which underscores its focus on producing artisanal quality products rather than mass production. The company adheres to a rigorous regulatory framework, ensuring that all products meet the highest standards of purity and safety !! \n\nI am extremely proud that this strain is delivered to patients in a glass jar, it is the only way quality cannabis should be stored as it definitely preserves the quality of the budz 👌👌 I love everything about this jar especially the way it shows the main terps which are Limonene, Cedrene and Pinene with a total terp percentage of 2.85 ! Kootenay is a real Connoisseur finishing off each jar with a unique signature.  \n\nJager smells absolutely insane ! There is no flower on the medical market which smells identical to this strain it is really special, it has a unique scent of berries and jagermeister ! Budz have a perfect moisture level, they feel solid and break off with a nice snap 👌👌 This strain grinds up amazing ! Not over fluffy and far from dusty it is just right. \n\nThe exhale is wicked !! Nice thick cloud of vapour in my ball vape with a temp of 605f which is my sweet spot for most strains as it is close to combustion but not there yet as I like to finish my bowls in one go to get the most flavour out of each bowl without having to keep going 2-3 times at a lower temp. The flavour boasts with sweet berries, no licorice taste what so ever which I am even more happier about 😆😆 \n\nThe effects this strain has to offer is exactly what I look for in premium cannabis. Couch locked and really really really relaxed 👌👌 Definitely feel that it takes away chronic pain and stress, it mellows though out my body giving me the ultimate feeling of relaxation ! I paid $160.99 for this strain and I’ll happily pay it again it is quality ! \n\n\n",

This is not only factually wrong, this is extremely dangerous.\n\nLet me make this clear: the marketing copy for this product doesn't claim to be preservative-free. The copy brags about having AHA and plant extracts, but they don't claim to be [preservative-free] (https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/african-botanics-pure-marula-cleansing-oil.html). If the company did, they would have been wrong. \n\nThis is the ingredient list: \n\n>Glycerin, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Aqua, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Sorbitan Oleate, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Moringa Pterygosperma (Moringa) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Isoamyl Laurate, Lauryl Glucoside, Coco Glucoside, Eriocephalus punctulatus (Chamomile Cape) Essential Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit) Essential Oil, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccahrinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Extract, Tocopherol Acetate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate\\*, Citral\\*, Citronellal\\*, Geraniol\\*, Limonene\\*, Linalool\\*. \\*Constituents Of Natural Essential Oils Used. \\*\\*Certified Organic. 100% Vegan. Gluten-free.\n\nGuess what? Both dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol are used as preservatives. So the writer's claim about preservative-free is factually wrong.\n\nHere's the bigger issue, though: cosmetic products need preservative systems. \n\nYou cannot sell an unsafe product. Cosmetics are often a mixture of oils and water, which is perfect breeding ground for disease agents like mold and bacteria and viruses and fungi. This means that you cannot sell a product without an adequate preservative system. These germs need to be killed, or you will sicken someone, if not kill them. \n\nEven if you did your best to disinfect the manufacturing equipment, and even if all of the employees involved in manufacture practice safe manufactory practices, bacteria and mold can still get in. Plus, as a consumer uses the product, it will accumulate bacteria, fungi and mold over time. If these are allowed to grow unimpeded, this can change the color, scent, texture, etc of the product. Consumers like having a product that lasts as long as possible. As such, it is very important to have a system in place to preserve the product, not only to preserve human health, but to keep a product usable for as long as possible. \n\nTherefore, suggesting that a product 100% lacks preservatives, and implying that this is a good thing, is extremely irresponsible. By suggesting that having no system in place is more ethical, natural, or safe, you are endangering people's lives. Additionally, you are forcing your readers to spend more money on products than they need to, simply because preservative systems are necessary for it to last long enough for it to be used up. \n\n(I will note that there are products that claim to be self-preserving; these products don't use traditional preservatives, but they still have a system in place. Whether these are adequate is outside the scope of this post, but even the natural cosmetic lines agree that preserving products is a good thing.)\n\nAlso, the chemical-free line is just wrong. All matter is chemical. Oil is a chemical, extracts are chemicals, water is a chemical... ",

    "body": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have had a complicated relationship with deodorant my whole life. You know how some people boast that they rarely have to wear deodorant because they just \"don't smell\"? I have the opposite problem. I become smelly easier than most people. It sucks and is a source of embarrassment. \n\nWhat complicates matters is that most \"normal\" deodorant (think Dove, Old Spice, Arm and Hammer, etc, even Schmidt's which is \"natural\") irritates my skin pretty severely. After using for a while my skin in my armpits becomes sensitive and red, and then after showering the skin just starts peeling off. This leaves super sensitive, red, broken skin behind which burns even more when deodorant is applied to it. I honestly thought that this experience with deodorant was normal until I had people tell me otherwise. \n\nSo of course that, plus the fact that as a vegan I buy cruelty free alternatives whenever they exist, of course lead me to trying hippie deodorant. These types of deodorants come with their own set of problems for me: most of them just don't work. I know that people say there is a \"detoxing\" period when using natural deodorants, and that you'll be a little bit smellier for a while. Well, with any natural deodorant I've tried, I've used it long enough to be through with that phase, and they still just don't keep me smelling as fresh as I would want. I'm sure I've tried at least 10 types of natural deodorant, and the closest I came to being satisfied with them was when using Everyman Jack's citrus deodorant. It didn't irritate my pits, smelled pretty good, and would keep me fresh longer than most natural deodorant, but still not as fresh as the mainstream stuff. \n\nEnter [Aromaco](https://www.lushusa.com/body/deodorants/aromaco/00051.html). I've been trying to work towards zero waste, so I was excited that LUSH had a packaging free deodorant. I was sceptical about how effective it would be, given my bad history with deodorant. I figured if it didn't work for me, my wife could use it at least. \n\nAromaco is a solid brick of deodorant. When you first buy it, it is the texture of a handmade soap. Based on suggestions from reviewers online, before using it the first time, I took a vegetable peeler to the side of it I would be applying to my armpits. Peeling off this dried part of it reveals the deodorant inside, which is the same texture as a normal bar of deodorant. To apply it you hold the sides of it that are still dry, and rub the exposed part of it against your pits like you would any normal deodorant. When you're done using it, you store it in an airtight container so the part you shaved off doesn't dry out again. A small tin or even a Ziploc bag would work fine. I kept mine in an empty Harney and Son's tea tin, and then transferred it into an empty plastic LUSH tub when it got smaller. \n\nWhen I used it I was pleasantly surprised. Not only does it not irritate my armpits *at all,* but it also keeps me smelling super fresh. **Aromaco is the only deodorant I've ever used that works as well as mainstream deodorant without irritating my skin,** and trust me, I've tried an obscene amount of different deodorants**.** I've been using it for about 5 months now every day, and I'm about to order more because it has turned into a small stub. It's honestly been life changing for me, because I no longer have to compromise between not having body odour and having flesh left in my armpits. \n\nI super highly recommend Aromaco to anyone who is in a situation similar to me, or who prefers \"natural\" deodorant and is trying to limit the waste they create. As far as LUSH products go, it's pretty reasonably priced too: $6.95 USD for a 3.5oz. block of deodorant that lasts around 6 months for me. I've seen \"natural\" deodorants in grocery stores for more than that. Some of the reviews on LUSH's website for it say that it can be irritating, but from my experience LUSH is happy to take back purchases if you have a negative reaction to them. \n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n|PROS|CONS|\n|:-|:-|\n|long lasting freshness|doesn't have a nice perfume/cologne smell, but you could remedy this by applying a fragrance after use|\n|does not irritate my skin at all|although reasonably priced, not the absolute cheapest|\n|almost zero waste packaging (comes wrapped in a bit of paper)|not hypoallergenic, has irritated the skin of at least one reviewer |\n|doesn't mark clothing at all|you have to touch the deodorant with your hands|\n|won't foam up if armpits are slightly wet like Jason's or Tom's deodorants will|that's it, |\n|cruelty free and vegan|there are no other cons|\n\nIngredients:\n\n[Water (Aqua), ](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=9566)[Propylene Glycol, ](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=9635)[Sodium Stearate, ](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=9630)[Witch Hazel Extract (Hamamelis Virginiana), ](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=9986)[Chamomile Vinegar (Matricaria Chamomilla), ](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=11398)[Sodium Bicarbonate, ](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=9530)[Patchouli Oil (Pogostemon Cablin), ](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=9570)[Citral, ](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=10217)[Limonene, ](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=10164)[Fragrance](https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder/ingredient?iid=10917)\n\nYou can [buy it online here](https://www.lushusa.com/body/deodorants/aromaco/00051.html), or to make your purchase even less wasteful buy it in person. \n\n ",

For reference, the Kopari one kept me fresh longer but I needed to reapply a lot, the Jason one gave me a rash and Stridex gave me first degree burns on my first application. Will try Aromaco again to see how I react to it. Thanks for the insight!",

    "body": "Hi All,\n\n\n\nSomeone posted a thread asking for an affordable sunscreen recommendation, and I thought I'd share the comment again.\n\nI actually made a post about it last year, but obviously it's gone to the bottom of the list. I hope it's okay to post about it again, since summer is very soon.\n\n\nI also kind of want more people to buy it. It feels sad that not many people know about it, when in my opinion it's really good. I have tried la Roche posay, nivea uv face, and I really think this one is better. But of course be careful and check the ingredient list!\n\n\nHere was my comment:\n\n\nI really like the asda sun cream which I have been using for 2 years now since discovering it one day - ASDA Protect SPF 50+ Face Q10 Anti-Age Sun Cream. I have the most sensitive skin, probably one of the most sensitive skin types you will ever meet due to my chronic eczema, and this one doesn't irritate me at all. To be honest, in the last year my eczema has been under control, and I was using this, so I can't say that it worsened my skin.\n\n\nIts only £2.40 so I think it's worth a try, and its UVA rating is very high- more than my nivea face uv sunscreen for £15ish (which burns my eyes). The only issue is that it's not matte. For me that's ok, as it covers my cracked and flaky skin. But you might want to try their matte version, which is the same price. If you want to try this one I am happy to take a picture/video of its consistency for you?\n\n\nHere are its ingredients:\nAqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Tapioca Starch, Coco-Caprylate, Undecane, Tocopheryl Acetate, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Silica, Panthenol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Tridecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Xanthan Gum, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Ubiquinone, Sodium Hydroxide, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citronellol, Limonene, Tocopherol, Linalool, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil\n\n\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck.",

        "body": "Hey OP, just wanted to give my opinion on this. After seeing this post I went out and grabbed some as I have an ASDA close-by. I have dry-normal sensitive skin and wanted to give it a try considering the great price. Only been using it today so its only a first impression but so far, so good! \n\nNo cast, sinks in nicely though it did leave me a bit greasy initially but after 10 mins or so it faded and looked normal, can barely tell I even had it on. I cut out my morning moisturizer as I figured it would be rich enough to cover that as well and I was right. I definitely wouldn't moisturize then apply this, the SPF is all I need. \n\nI have notoriously sensitive eyes so admittedly I haven't tried it in that area yet as I had to go out and didn't want to risk burning eyes so I used my usual SPF (the bondi sands one) and then applied the ASDA one everywhere else and I've had no issues. \n\nI will be trying it around the eyes tomorrow though as I'm not going anywhere. You may have just saved me a lot of future money OP so thanks! Even if it doesn't work around the eyes I can at least apply it to the rest of the face and use my usual in that area meaning it will last longer so its win/win really.\n\nUPDATE: So I've now tried it around the eyes and it felt fine for the first couple of hours, however after that I did experience some very mild burning in the eye area. Having said that, when I say \"very mild\" I mean really, really mild. If I was out and about I probably wouldn't even notice it as it only lasted a couple of minutes and then stopped. \n\nI would still class this as a success. Mild for me is still an improvement over most SPF's I've tried since my eyes are so sensitive. I will continue to use this and possibly just use my usual SPF around my eyes and the ASDA one on the rest of my face. Which will make my more expensive one last a lot longer since its only going to be used in the eye area.",

    "body": "Chemovar facade is a balanced hybrid  strain at 25% THC 🩷 and 2% CBG. I have discovered the incredible effects of CBG as an anti anxiety medicine and I really look for strains that have a decent CBG component - a few of the new Chemovar flowers have 2% CBG including this, and it’s awesome to see these other minor cannabanoids represented in Oz MC as we collectively increase our knowledge and appreciation of other minor cannabanoids such as CBG and CBN (a game changer for insomnia) 💚💚💚\n\nAs with all Chemovar flowers, this is incredibly terpy with 3.32% terps🔥\n\nDominant terps are nerolidol, beta caryophyllene, trans-nerolidol, limonene and linalool🤗\n\nIt’s a gorgeous combination of terps that has an intriguing and enjoyable  complex aroma. Opening the tub releases a delightful aroma that is fruity, floral, woody, candy and herbaceous 💚\n\nChemovar Facade is Apples and Bananas x Eye Candy. Apples and bananas has become a cult favorite in Oz MC, and this pheno hunt which has resulted in this cross is heavenly in terms of aroma, taste and effects 🍏 🍌 🍭 \n\nChemovar release lovingly grown craft cannabis. Hand trimmed and slow cured. They have absolutely nailed the recent releases - Bling Blaow, Facetz, Facade, Candy Pave and Triangle Chem.\n\nAs for all of the Chemovar  strains it’s fresh, loud, sticky, resinous, trichome laden goodness 😎 Chemovar delivers the sticky icky every time 🥰\n\nThe buds are a bright green with strong hints of purple, that are  covered in orange pistils, and frosty as!!!!! \n\nThe unique strain crosses, the freshness, and the unique terp profiles make all the new releases very refreshing in the Australian cannabis market. Chemovar only release very high quality medical cannabis, thank you Chemovar! 👏🙌🏼🫶🏽\n\nThe effects are uplifting and relaxing. Wonderful antidepressant effects - a very happy sensation with a weighted blanket feeling, suited to the evening slot for me. I love limonene for its antidepressant effects, and the linalool provides all the relaxation I need to wind down after a busy day 🧘‍♀️ \n\nAs an aside, for my fellow insomniacs - I  can’t recommend Triangle Chem more! I am always on the search for the best insomnia strains, this is it by far! For both sleep onset and to help you get back to sleep if you wake at night and struggle to get back to sleep. Miraculously I wake up perky and refreshed. Sourdough always made me groggy, cosmos went downhill, this is the key to unlock insomnia! I literally thank TC in the middle of the night for being so effective! This new batch hits really hard too, even harder than the first batch! 🥊 😴 \n\nI’m so grateful for the craft cannabis cannabis connoisseurs that bring us all the best cannabis products in Oz MC 👑\n\nFor me the trophies go to Chemovar, Single Estate and Canadian Craft Cannabis Company (superseed and mystery mountain) Broken Coast, and West Coast Palms are a very exciting new addition with their Hawaiian Rain and (soon coming!) new release of White Hot Guava 🤤 \n\nChemovar continue to disrupt the market with well priced craft cannabis. A craft cannabis 10g tub for $138 works for me! If you’re looking for stock or your pharmacy doesn’t stock Chemovar, give the incredible Gavin at Heathershaws ( Glen Iris, vic) a call. I’ve been with many Vic pharmacies (Astrid, Seutika, Medigreen) and from my personal experience Heathershaws by far are the friendliest and most accomodating, professional, compassionate team, and they really  go out of their way for their patients 🤗 \n\nThis year promises to be another very exciting year for Oz MC!!! 🥳💚\n\n\n",

    "body": "Single Estate Ice Burn and Romulan \n\nSingle Estate does it again 🏆 \n\nSingle Estate Ice burn is an indica dominant 27% THC and 3.2% terps with the top terps being limonene, linalool and farnesene 🌿\n\nThis stunning unique strain is a collaboration with Woody Nelson, grown at Koots Canna 👑 \n\nStrain is lava cake x the menthol x the temptation 💚\n\nBuds are mostly large, dense, frosty and trichome laden with a strong purple hue. Beautifully cured, fresh, resinous and sticky 🤤 \n\nThe aroma is very complex, dominated by notes of menthol with a strong cake undertone. In my TM2 I get lots of mint on the inhale, and cake and cream and a touch of pine on the exhale. Produces lots of vapour 💨 \n\nI haven’t had many mc oz strains that are creepers, this a certified creeper! The effects start off mild but then it quickly turns to a huge uplift of euphoria and joy, a lovely mental holiday. The effects continue to infuse me with anti depressant effects that are really long lasting. Like the joy of going up on a roller coaster, without going down! 😃 \n\nEventually the effects move into a very calm mind state, without being sedating. Others have said this is useful as a night strain, but I can happily use it during the day 😍\n\nRomulan 🌿\n\nSingle Estate Romulan is an indica dominant 26% THC strain which is a cross between white rhino x an unknown strain, with an impressive 3.78% terps. Dominant terps are \nfarnesene, pinene, humulene. \nGrower is Casa De Fiore 💪\n\nAnother gorgeous cure with sticky resinous squishy and sticky icky buds!🎉\n\nThe smell and taste are completely unique- skunky, candy, earthy, piney, with a hint of sour citrus. It’s really loud and  pungent, I could smell it before I opened it! 🍭 🌲 🍋‍🟩 \n\nInterestingly, this is another absolute creeper! So amazing to have two creeper strains on the market. The effects are blissful and calming and relaxing. It’s a gradual build that keeps elevating my mood and calming my mind and body. Very intense cerebral effects. It’s a super warm blanket for the mind body and soul 🧘‍♀️ \n\nSingle Estate has nailed their new jars! They are shorter and wider, allowing for all the big buds to avoid being squashed, and allowing me to see all the buds in their glory 🌿🌿🌿\n\nAnother set of incredible releases from Single Estate, who keep bringing out really unique strains with a passion and commitment to the highest quality cannabis, which is much appreciated by our medical cannabis community, I’m keen to see what’s on the horizon for Single Estate 👑 🏆🌿",

But this is not about existing allergies.\n\nThere's this one skin care influencer I follow who, when commenting on a cream, said that it shouldn't be used because of the added fragrances (fair, as it contains limonene and linalool) and because it contains lanolin, which is quite irritating and known to trigger allergies.\n\nI swear, there was a record scratch happening. I had never heard of that before. Which doesn't have to mean shit, because I don't spend my time researching ingredients, neither for a living nor as a hobby. And I only realised how irritating SLS and limonene can (!) be, because I did a deep dive.\n\nAn admittedly perfunctory search yielded the result that usually lanolin is well tolerated. Yes, allergies to lanolin do it exist, but people can also be allergic to silicone, which is supposed to be hypoallergenic. So nothing's 100% safe, I guess.\n\nDid I miss anything? Should I ditch that cream (and others containing lanolin as the key ingredient) going forward because it will just cause allergies? Or is that kinda bs, because while allergies exist, lanolin is not allergenic? Or maybe, as is often the case, the truth is somewhere in the middle?\n\nETA: clarification in the last paragraph",

I was using a lip balm every night before bed, but one morning I woke up and my lips looked like two big, fat, garishly red caterpillars. I had allergy tests when I was a kid due to asthma and nothing except mold showed up so I never considered it, but it was around 20+ years prior. I stopped using the balm and thought maybe it was a bad batch or something. \n\nThen I had a couple lipsticks that did the same thing, I used them once or twice over a month or so. It was a cycle of them puffing up, then the next day they would be all crusty and shriveled, and the crusty would persist for at least a week while they healed up again. Like when they puffed up they would be very raw, then the next day it was almost like they scabbed over. \n\nSo I started thinking there must be a common denominator here. Lo and behold, it was lanolin. Every lanolin product inflames my lips. I have no problem wearing wool, it seems to be localized on my lips. \n\nI even went to the doctor about it and he said yes, it seems like an allergy but I would need to get tested to be sure. I declined because the closest allergist was over two hours away in another city with a one year wait and it wasn't life threatening or anything. It's easy enough to avoid in lip products, I have plenty of products with no lanolin. \n\nSo TLDR- I didn't have a problem with lanolin, until I did.",

When ground up it does the kinetic sand dance, which is what I look for in a premium flower as a sign of a beautiful cure 👌\n\nAmnesia Haze’s top terpenes are ocimene, myrcene and beta caryophyllene, followed by limonene and humulene. Ocimene is one of my fave terps but I don’t find it often represented in strains available here. The presence of limonene acts as an amazing anti depressant and the humulene helps stave off the munchies 🫦\n\nTemp stepping in my TM2 produces an impressive amount of vapour, and the taste and smell are very appealing. Notes of citrus, mango and a touch of spice and earth are just lovely! 🍋 🥭 \n\nThe tub contained mostly large nugs around 2-3g each, with no shake. The buds are dense and fluffy,  a lovely fresh bright green with purple tones as well, it’s visually stunning and has amazing bag appeal 🌿\n\nAmnesia Haze is an internationally loved strain which is a cross between Amnesia x Haze, thought to originate from a cross of South East Asian, Afghan/Hawaiian  indica strains crossed with land race sativa strains from Jamaica 🔥\n\nIt won the cannabis cup in 2004 and the in 2012 sativa cup and is deservedly a highly popular strain 🏆 \n\nFor me amnesia haze is uplifting, and works as a great anti depressant. Notable is the absence of terpinolene which I personally love but it is known to induce racy thoughts and anxiety in some patients, so this is a good strain for those seeking a sativa dom strain that isn’t terpinolene dominant 🧘‍♂️ \n\nThis strain isn’t particularly clear headed, it’s more of a creative uplift with a lovely mental vacation, bordering on psychelic, it’s really cruisy and peaceful, energising and uplifting  ☮️ \n\nThis is another gorgeous Broken Coast strain and another very effective day strain for me. As I’m in the discord I can confirm that all other fellow patients who have tried this strain also really love it. It’s staying firmly in my day rotation together with Broken Coast EMZ and my superwoman strain Superseed Rhapsody Haze - with these strains I’ve found the perfect trio for my day time rotation  ☀️🌟💚 and I continue to pray for the return of the mac day strain chemovar Britney’s Frozen lemons 🍋 🙏🏽 \n\nRRP is $150, I picked mine up from the wonderful Heathershaws in Glen Iris VIC who have the best customer service, a very friendly and professional team, and charge under RRP, so my tub was $145 🥰 I’m lucky to be very local to them and always feel so welcome every time I pop in (and enjoy chats with other patients!) but for others needing postage the discount on tubs covers the postage 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\n",
