    "body": "Long, lifted lashes are a huge halo, and open up your eyes a ton. Unfortunately, lash serums are controversial on here. Many people have experienced fat loss around the eyes due to Latisse and similar serums, but prostaglandin (and prostaglandin analogues) are the only ingredients that have been scientifically proven to increase lash length beyond genetic limitations.\n\n**What about castor oil?**\n\n* Castor oil just conditions the lashes and gives the appearance of thicker lashes.\n* Some people swear on their life that castor oil truly increased their lash length, but they previously damaged their natural lashes with mascara or extensions. Putting on castor oil therefore \\*\\*did\\*\\* grow their lashes, but not beyond their genetic limitations. As someone who doesn‚Äôt wear mascara, this is useless to me.\n* Though to be fair, castor oil does contain a ton of ricinoleic acid, which can be stimulating for growth. This probably explains the ample anecdotal evidence when it comes to hair growth on the scalp (if your bald spots are NOT caused by genetics). I don‚Äôt think it would work much for lashes though.\n\nAnyway, I went on a hunt for alternatives without side effects. There are a few ingredients that have been **scientifically shown to cause hair and lash growth** (in studies of varying quality), which I‚Äôve listed below, linking to sources:\n\nRed Clover Extract and [Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-tetrapeptide-3) (makes up Capixyl)\n\n[Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/myristoyl-pentapeptide-17) and [Myristoyl Hexapeptide-16](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/myristoyl-hexapeptide-16)\n\n[Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1 combined with Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotinoyl-tripeptide-1)\n\nRELEVANT PRODUCTS:\n\n[Angfa, Scalp-D Beaute, Pure Free Eyelash Premium Serum](https://www.iherb.com/pr/Angfa-Scalp-D-Beaute-Pure-Free-Eyelash-Premium-Serum-0-14-fl-oz-4-ml/93530) \\- Contains biotinoyl tripeptide-1, oligopeptide-20, acetyl decapeptide-3, octapeptide-2, oligopeptide-41, caprooyl tetrapeptide-3, acetyl tetrapeptide-5, acetyl hexapeptide-8 high up on the ingredients list. Not sure what any of these do lol, except for biotinoyl tripeptide-1, which is the first peptide on the list. Reviews are good, but results are not dramatic. Seems to do more conditioning than growing.\n\n[The Glow Makers Eyelash and Brow Growth Peptide Complex Serum](https://theglowmaker.com/collections/all-products/products/eyelash-and-brow-growth-peptide-complex-serum) \\- Contains Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Myristoyl Hexapeptide-16, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Red Clover Extract, Biotin. That‚Äôs EVERYTHING with studies on lash growth, what an absolute jackpot. The site is kind of sketchy though and there are no reviews, has anyone tried this?\n\n[Indeed Labs Peptalash II Eyelash Serum](https://www.ulta.com/peptalash-ii-eyelash-serum?productId=pimprod2012661) \\- Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, N-Prolyl Palmitoyl Tripeptide-56 Acetate (which I think is a component of Matrixyl). Interesting choice of peptides for sure‚Ä¶ also contains Apple Stem Cells ([Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/malus-domestica-fruit-cell-culture))‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know if that does anything for lashes. Reviews are mediocre, but it does work somewhat.\n\n[RevivLashes](https://revivserums.com/products/lash-brow-stimulating-serum) \\- rh-Polypeptide-3 (Keratinocyte Growth Factor, apparently), Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Myristoyl Octapeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Tripeptide-3, Copper Tripeptide-1 (Oof, copper peptides are a controversial but it‚Äôs the last ingredient). Reviews for this seem really good and it contains most of the peptides helpful for lash growth, plus some others that might be helpful. Also contains Apple Stem Cells.\n\n[Luna Nectar Moon Boost](https://lunanectar.com/products/moon-boost) \\- Contains Red Clover Extract, Castor Oil, and Biotin, but none of the peptides. I doubt this would work, but the reviews seem good if they can be believed. It‚Äôs definitely the most natural and ‚Äúsafest‚Äù out of everything in the list, though.\n\nI plan to try RevivLashes or The Glow Maker, but am wary of both. Has anyone tried a prostaglandin-free serum that actually worked? And what do you do for your lashes?",

The package warning does indicate the possibility of iris color change and a dark line, neither of which I've yet experienced.   \n\n\nI did just email Obagi to ask and will post their response.  \n\n\nI just received GrandeBrow, choosing it because it was less expensive than Obagi, while reviews seemed to indicate good results.

    "body": "\nHey all! üëãüèªI want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

    "body": "## [Product Deets from Deciem's website](https://deciem.com/en-in/theordinary/mas-rdn-multi-peptide-serum-for-hair-density.html?dwvar_mas-rdn-multi-peptide-serum-for-hair-density_size=60ml&quantity=1):\n\nThis concentrated formula is designed to support hair health so that it looks thicker, denser, fuller and healthier. The technologies present in this formula include **REDENSYL**‚Ñ¢ complex (with Larix Europaea Wood Extract and Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract), **Procapil**‚Ñ¢ peptide complex (with Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1), **CAPIXY**L‚Ñ¢ peptide complex (with Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3 and Trifolium Pratense Flower Extract), **BAICAPIL**‚Ñ¢ complex (with Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Triticum Vulgare Germ Extract and Glycine Soja Germ Extract), **AnaGain**‚Ñ¢ (Pisum Sativum Extract) and High-Solubility **Caffeine** (1% net Caffeine by weight), in an ultra-lightweight, emollient base for efficient penetration. The total concentration of these technologies in the formula by weight is 21.15%.\n\n## Purchased from:\n\n[Cult Beauty](https://www.cultbeauty.com/the-ordinary-multi-peptide-serum-for-hair-density-60ml/11841280.html?autocomplete=productsuggestion)\n\n*Customs Info for anyone who's interested*: The first time, I'd purchased two bottles, along with a few other products- my order total came to Rs 4530 and I had to pay \\~53% of that(Rs 2400) for customs. The second time, I'd purchased two bottles of this alone- they were on discount and the discount amount was higher than the shipping fees, so I paid for shipping and got both bottles for 3k(including shipping) and paid no customs fees. I've ordered from Cult Beauty 4 times so far- Order Amounts: 2.2k, 500, 4530 and \\~3k- and only had to pay customs once. Location: Kerala\n\n## Usage:\n\n*Usage Period:* \\~4 months\n\n*How I use it:*  I use it maybe around 4 night a week, concentrating on the front of my head, by sectioning my hair and dropping \\~3 drops of the serum along each parting(it spreads quite easily, so that's enough). It takes a little over half a pipette to do this(I have a pretty small head though, I think most people might need a bit more). I then put on an episode of a TV show/anime and massage till the episode ends if it's a short one, otherwise for half the episode, so roughly around 20 minutes?\n\n## Texture:\n\nViscous, easily spreadable liquid, which means a little goes a long way.\n\n## Greasiness:\n\nLeaves hair looking a tad greasy right afterwards, but it goes back to normal by morning(disclaimer: I don't have a greasy scalp at all, so idk how it'll fare for those of you who do).\n\n## Weird shit:\n\nMy scalp felt all weird and tingly the day after I used it for the first time- not bad, per se, but noticeable enough to be distracting. You know those sci-fi movies where they show the supervillain's head expanding till they look like more human versions of Mojo Jojo? Kinda felt like that was about to happen to me. Experienced this again to a slighter degree the next time, and then never again.\n\n## Results:\n\n* *Hair Fall:* By the end of the third week, my hairfall had decreased dramatically. I have depression, so every now and then, I go long periods of time without washing my hair, which sucks because I get insane hairfall if I go longer than 5-7 days without washing it. Towards the end of the first month, I was going through a tough time and didn't wash my hair for \\~10 days. I'd braced myself for the insane hairfall- and it never came! Not when I detangled my hair pre-wash, not when I shampooed or conditioned it and not when I towel-dried it. Like I was fully prepared for 100+ strands, but I'm pretty sure I didn't lose over 30 during the whole process.\n* *Hair Growth:* It's only been \\~4 months and I don't have any visible bald spots, plus I always have a halo of baby hair so I'm not sure I'll be able to tell how effective it is here, unless there's a dramatic difference. But while I'm not sure if it increased the growth of new hair, I think it sped up my hair growth? Like I think it got longer faster? My hair normally doesn't grow super quickly(for context, I've been getting my hair smoothened since I was in high school and when my roots grow out, they're not noticeable at all for the first 5-6 months, fairly noticeable from months 6-9 and very noticeable and looks pretty damn weird from months 9-12). Around the time I started using this, I had a big haircut and I just had another haircut yesterday back to that same length yesterday and the hairdresser definitely chopped off over 2 inches. So I think that's more than 2 inches in 4 months, which is higher than my usual rate. Sounds like I'm rambling, I know, but I'm explaining all this so you know this is all completely anecdotal, I hadn't taken any before and after pictures.\n\n## VFM:\n\nThe first time I purchased this before Cult Beauty turned evil and stopped docking prices on checkout for non-EU citizens. Two bottles of it cost me Rs 2732 then\n\n\\-> one bottle(60ml) = 2732/2 = **Rs 1366**\n\nBUT I had to pay 53% customs, which means\n\n\\-> one bottle(60ml) = 1366 x 1.53 = **Rs 2090**\n\nThe second time was after Cult Beauty turned evil, but with discount + shipping charges + no customs, I only had to pay Rs 3078 for 2 bottles, which means\n\n\\-> one bottle(60ml) = 3078/2 = **Rs 1539**\n\n*How long a bottle lasts for me:* 2.5-3 months\n\nCustoms fees are erratic, ranging from 0-70% from what I've seen on this sub, so I guess this answer's going to be very subjective. I'd say it's definitely worth a purchase if you have slight hairfall, especially if it's on sale, if it's within your budget, but if not, I think Be Minimalist has a dupe for it with all the same actives, which goes on B2G1 sales a lot(haven't tried that one myself, but I've heard good things about it on this sub).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note:** If you have excessive hairfall, I think you should save your money and see a trichologist instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Repurchase Status:\n\nOn my second bottle now, already repurchased a third for myself and a fourth for my mom(might update in a few months if she sees significant results, but she's not consistent with beauty stuff, so don't count on this).\n\nI think I'd repurchase this forever and it would totally be my HG IF it were easier to source. Why oh why can't Deciem retail in India\n\nI think I might put a brief pause on repurchasing this after I empty my current stash to try the dupe by Be Minimalist, but such a tiny bottle ugh. If anyone has tried both, I'd love to hear a comparison!",

It also creates a false sense of scarcity that tricks people into thinking they need to be buying new makeup at all times to squeeze money out of us while we never finish a product.

It‚Äôs become quite distressing, with visible bald spots and very dry, frizzy strands ‚Äî even though my scalp gets oily quickly.

I know no one here can diagnose, but I‚Äôm just hoping to hear from others who may have had a similar experience ‚Äî especially those dealing with long-term hairfall that didn‚Äôt respond to typical treatments.\n\nHow did you eventually cope with it or manage it? Any lifestyle changes that helped? Emotional support ideas are also welcome ‚Äî this has taken a toll on my self-confidence.\n\nThank you to this community ‚Äî it really helps to not feel alone in this. ",

The Hairfact Kit is something I've been using for years myself - it's a multivitamin kit and we need those vitamins and trust me our diets - no matter how clean - are not supplying us with the necessary amounts. \n\n2. Diet is THE MOST important factor in hair care and hair loss. I've been on this journey for 12 years now, but finally learnt the lesson that a PCOS sensitive and focused diet is must. \n\n3. Minoxidil is your ride or die. Once you start, you should not stop. I made this mistake a few times and I'm suffering for it. Use minoxidil 5% (I was prescribed Minicheck 5%) and it's effective. But DO NOT STOP and 6 months is nearly not enough time to notice results. 6 months is pure shedding and realignment of your hair's growth cycle. The magic begins after 6 months. But it takes up to a year to really truly SEE the difference. \n\nI'm experiencing THE WORST SHEDDING of my life rn, cus I stopped Mino for a year and lost all the progress I had made over years! So I've had to restart and I've lost 1/2 my volume. I bun my hair cus my braid or pony is worryingly thin!\n\nAlso, idk if you've texted your fasting insulin, that's a key factor in reversing PCOS - if that's what you have. If you're not sure, get all your PCOS tests done for a better understanding of why you're losing hair. \n\nLastly, exercise. MUST. Even a 30 min walk - you have to. 5 times a week at least.",

I use it every night, and the instructions say to use it on a dry scalp, and not to wash it off - so don‚Äôt use it directly before or after a shower.\n\nIt‚Äôs fairly easy to massage into my head, but it‚Äôs definitely a very wet serum, and it takes time to dry, almost an hour if I‚Äôve been liberal with it. The top of my head definitely looks like I‚Äôve just taken a shower after I use it. Its consistency is only slightly thicker than water and it kind of trickles down your head if you don‚Äôt immediately massage it in. But at the same time, it‚Äôs sticky?! Even after it dries, even in the morning, it feels a bit sticky, which is frustrating if you‚Äôve just washed your hair. But if I brush through the stickiness, it dissipates and my hair looks normal. That‚Äôs my biggest complaint about this product - the stickiness makes my hair feel unclean.\n\nIt also has a very natural earthy but medicinal type of smell that doesn‚Äôt bother me and that I quite like, but I completely understand if someone else would be bothered by it. The first night I used it, the smell lingered for a while, but on subsequent nights I noticed it less and less, probably because I got used to the scent.\n\nIn terms of effectiveness, this is a serum that‚Äôs supposed to increase density of growing, so it needs time to take effect. As I understand it, it probably won‚Äôt have much effect on already grown strands of hair. So I need to wait about 3 months before I actually compare before and after. But so far there has been a very strong placebo effect where the morning after, I feel like my scalp is less visible through my hair. Again, probably just a placebo effect, but I like feeling like something is actually working, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve kept it up.\n\nIn terms of ingredients, I‚Äôm most interested in the fact that it has a highly soluble version of caffeine, which has been proven to stimulate hair growth. As for oils, it says in the ingredients list that it has castor oil (which explains the stickiness to me, castor oil is notoriously sticky) so maybe not the best product for you? But also, it‚Äôs very low down on the ingredients list, so maybe you can tolerate it??\n\ntbh I‚Äôm 50/50 on it so far. I might be more upset if I‚Äôd actually paid the original $30+ for it, but since it was about $13 when I bought it, I‚Äôm ok with what it‚Äôs been doing so far.\n\nHope this helps!",

    "body": "Hey :)\n\nIf like me you are trying to grow back your hair in the hardship that trichotillomania is, here's a sum up of some info ChatGPT was kind enough to provide to me asking \"what prompted hair growth following repeated hair follicule traction due to trichotillomania?\" and \"which serums contains such ingredients and are available over-the-counter in France [I live there]?\":\nPeptides can play a significant role in promoting hair follicle health and supporting hair regrowth by stimulating specific pathways that encourage hair growth. Here‚Äôs a list of peptides, sorted from the most effective to the least, based on current research and usage in hair loss treatments:\n\n\" 1. Copper Peptides (GHK-Cu)\n   - Effectiveness: Very high\n   - Mechanism: Copper peptides, especially GHK-Cu, are one of the most researched peptides in hair growth. They have anti-inflammatory properties, promote blood flow to the scalp, and help repair damaged follicles. Copper peptides can also increase the size of hair follicles and prolong the growth phase (anagen phase) of hair.\n  \n2. Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-20 (PTD-DBM)\n   - Effectiveness: High\n   - Mechanism: This peptide is designed to inhibit the actions of DKK-1, a protein that inhibits hair follicle activity. By blocking DKK-1, PTD-DBM promotes the growth of new hair and protects existing hair follicles from damage.\n   \n3. Biomimetic Peptides (Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3)\n   - Effectiveness: High\n   - Mechanism: This peptide helps stimulate the extracellular matrix of the hair follicle, improving anchorage and reducing hair loss. It is often combined with other peptides and natural extracts to support overall scalp health and hair density.\n    \n\n4. Thymosin Beta-4 (TB500)\n   - Effectiveness: Moderate to High\n   - Mechanism: TB500 is known for its healing and regenerative properties. While its main role is in tissue repair, it has been suggested to support hair follicle recovery by reducing inflammation and promoting cell regeneration around damaged hair follicles.\n   \n\n5. Oligopeptide-54\n   - Effectiveness: Moderate\n   - Mechanism: This peptide inhibits the negative effects of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which is a major cause of hair thinning and loss. Oligopeptide-54 can help maintain hair density and support regrowth in cases of androgenetic alopecia.\n   \n6. Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17\n   - Effectiveness: Moderate\n   - Mechanism: This peptide is primarily known for stimulating keratin production, which is a key component of hair. While it is more commonly used in eyelash and eyebrow growth products, it can be used on the scalp to improve hair strength and thickness.\n   \n\n7. Biotinyl-GHK (Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1)\n   - Effectiveness: Moderate\n   - Mechanism: This peptide combines biotin (which supports keratin production) with GHK to improve hair strength and reduce breakage. It enhances the health of the hair shaft, though it may not be as effective in treating follicular damage or hair regrowth compared to copper peptides.\n   - Products: Found in hair strengthening treatments and serums.\n\n8. Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide-8)\n   - Effectiveness: Low to Moderate\n   - Mechanism: Argireline is better known for its anti-wrinkle properties, but it may support blood circulation in the scalp, indirectly helping to nourish hair follicles. It‚Äôs not a primary peptide for hair regrowth but may be used in conjunction with other more potent peptides.\n\n\n\nHere are some options containing these ingredients:\n\n1. The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tKey Peptides: Copper Peptides (GHK-Cu), Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3.\n\t‚Ä¢\tOther Active Ingredients: Caffeine, Biotin, and Hyaluronic Acid.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDescription: This is a popular serum that targets thinning hair by nourishing the scalp and promoting healthy follicle function.

    "body": "The Ordinary Multi-Peptide [Lash and Brow Serum](https://theordinary.com/en-us/multi-peptide-lash-brow-serum-100111.html) could not be launched at a better time. The GrandeLASH-MD serum, a popular lash serum, was under fire on TikTok as multiple users reported this serum caused fat losses on their eyelids, to the extent one user's monolid became a double lid! Further research shows that this is not something new, many lash serums have the culprit ingredient, a synthetic Prostaglandin Analogues that can cause darkening around the eye area, fat losses on eyelids, and even changes in eye colors. And‚Ä¶the ingredient is not approved by the FDA to be used in most of these eyelash serums.\n\nSo just when everyone is searching for a new lash and brow serum, The Ordinary launched a lash serum formulated with multi-peptides, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, and plant extracts. The Ordinary created this product because its customers were so much in love with their Multi-Peptide Hair Growth Serum that they applied it to brows and eyelashes and saw amazing results. Then customers were urging The Ordinary to create one to be absolutely safe and easy to be used on lashes and brows.¬†\n\nThe [**Multi-Peptide Lash and Brow Serum**](https://theordinary.com/en-us/multi-peptide-lash-brow-serum-100111.html)¬†($14.5) was born.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihadq6akbu691.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc67b26d3d9a0367fce4fc75855c5519753b6d79\n\nPeptides are the building blocks of proteins. They are often used in anti-aging products as some peptides stimulate cells to produce more collagen. Some support hair fibre. The Ordinary used a combination of peptides to aid hair growth and health.\n\nWe tried it and have to say, although the result is not as quick as the traditional lash serum, which is visible after a couple of days, it does work. After 2‚Äì4 weeks we could see obvious thickening of the brows and lashes, minus the side effects, with no irritation or darkening around the eyes. And it only costs around 15 bucks for 0.16oz. To put into perspective, Revital Lash costs $110 for 0.1oz (4 months of daily use)‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn1df6blbu691.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f420f698293de5e13a4aa97323123714c4b0fe9",

I found that it too provided relief. I stopped using it due to what I read in the guides in this subreddit---I decided to try coal tar shampoo to get rid of the scaling first, and then try the Natural Moisturizing serum to keep my scalp moisturized. The coal tar shampoo has worked wonders. The scaling disappeared and so did the itch after the first time using the shampoo. I've used it 3 times in the past 10 days. Today was a hair wash day but I didn't use the coal tar shampoo. I used one with oat milk and aloe vera. Since I have dry hair, I used a heavy conditioner (I don't apply conditioner to my head so I don't get any on my scalp). Before I blow dried my hair, I applied the hair serum to my scalp and massage it in. I am hoping the serum will keep me itch free.¬†\n\n\nIf you could provide an update if the serum you're using continues to work, that would be great.",

But thinning strands, brittle texture, and a scalp that feels like the Sahara? **That‚Äôs not wisdom‚Äîit‚Äôs war.**\n\nLet‚Äôs cut through the noise. Aging hair isn‚Äôt inevitable. New science proves you can *reverse* damage, *rebuild* density, and *reclaim* the thick, glossy hair you thought was gone forever.\n\nHere‚Äôs the battle-tested playbook‚Äî*no fluff, no myths, just results*.\n\n# Problem #1: Your Hair Thins Faster Than Your Patience\n\nThinning hair isn‚Äôt just about genetics. It‚Äôs a sabotage mission: shrinking follicles, hormonal shifts, and a scalp starving for nutrients.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n* **Nuke DHT (The Silent Killer)** DHT‚Äîa testosterone byproduct‚Äîstrangles follicles, shortening their growth phase. Block it with pumpkin seed extract, clinically shown to inhibit 5-alpha reductase, the enzyme that fuels DHT production.\n* **Peptide Power** Peptides like *Copper Tripeptide-1* and *Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1* penetrate follicles, stimulating collagen, keratin, and blood flow. Think of them as ‚Äúhair fertilizer‚Äù for thicker, stronger strands.\n* **PRP Therapy** Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections flood your scalp with growth factors, waking up dormant follicles. Advanced versions like *Magick PRP* boost efficacy by 96%, turning miniaturized hairs back into lions.\n\n# Problem #2: Your Scalp is a Desert (And Your Hair is Dying of Thirst)\n\nDry, flaky scalp? It‚Äôs not just dandruff. Aging reduces sebum production, leaving follicles parched and prone to inflammation.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n* **Ceramide Bombs** Swap harsh shampoos for ceramide-infused formulas. These lipids rebuild your scalp‚Äôs moisture barrier, locking in hydration and shielding against pollution.\n* **HydraFacial Keravive** This clinical-grade treatment detoxifies your scalp, exfoliates dead skin, and floods follicles with peptides and hyaluronic acid. Results? A scalp that feels 20 years younger.\n* **Scalp Serums** Nightly serums with caffeine and niacinamide boost microcirculation, delivering oxygen and nutrients straight to follicle roots.\n\n# Problem #3: Your Hair Breaks Like Cheap Plastic\n\nYears of heat styling, coloring, and UV damage leave hair brittle. Aging strips keratin, turning strands into fragile twigs.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n* **Vegan Keratin Shampoos** Vegan keratin binds to damaged areas, repairing cracks in the hair shaft. Pair with silk peptide conditioners to add a bulletproof shield against breakage.\n* **Exosome Therapy** The next-gen alternative to PRP, exosomes deliver regenerative signals to follicles, reversing structural damage and accelerating growth.\n* **Heat Protection** Never style without a thermal guard. Look for dimethicone-free options that won‚Äôt weigh hair down.\n\n# Problem #4: Your Hair Cycle is Stuck in Reverse\n\nAging shortens the *anagen* (growth) phase and traps follicles in *telogen* (resting). Result? Less hair, slower regrowth.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n* **Prolong Anagen with Retinol** Scalp retinol unclogs follicles, speeds cell turnover, and extends growth cycles. Pair with lactic acid to enhance absorption.\n* **Microneedling** 0.5mm needles create micro-injuries, triggering collagen production and pushing follicles back into growth mode.\n* **Nutrient Overload** Biotin, zinc, and iron deficiencies starve follicles. Supplement with hair-specific blends or eat *more*: spinach, eggs, salmon.\n\n# Problem #5: You‚Äôre Losing the Mental Game\n\nStress isn‚Äôt just in your head‚Äîit‚Äôs on your pillow. Cortisol spikes push follicles into shedding mode, accelerating aging.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n* **Adaptogens** Ashwagandha and rhodiola lower cortisol, protecting follicles from stress-induced fallout.\n* **Mindful Massage** Daily scalp massage with a jade comb boosts blood flow by 22%, turning tension into thicker hair.\n* **Sleep > Serum** Poor sleep hikes DHT. Prioritize 7-8 hours nightly‚Äîyour follicles repair themselves during deep REM cycles.\n\n**Final Rally Cry**  \nAging hair isn‚Äôt a life sentence. It‚Äôs a problem with a *proven solution*.\n\nYou‚Äôre not just fighting symptoms‚Äîyou‚Äôre rebuilding from the ground up.\n\nStart today:\n\n1. **Assault DHT** with pumpkin seed extract.\n2. **Bombard follicles** with peptides and PRP.\n3. **Fortify strands** with vegan keratin.\n4. **Dominate stress** with adaptogens.\n\nYour hair doesn‚Äôt retire at 50. Neither should you.\n\n*Want more? Dive into our free guide on reversing hair aging‚Äîor book a consultation with a trichologist.

This is due to the glycerine contained in the product, which nourishes the hair, and sodium hyaluronate, which makes the hair more resistant.*\n\n[Deeply moisturised](https://nplink.net/u5is5fcz)\n\n*It is very important to keep your skin and hair hydrated.

This is because the substance contains glycerine, which nourishes the hair, as well as sodium hyaluronate, which strengthens the hair.\n\n**Intensively hydrated**\n\nIt is important to maintain hydration in your skin and hair. It's possible that the urea in the product is responsible for the product's natural moisture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n7ml8g570iy61.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f880b033649df573179a1e4c800f76143f665dc\n\n**What is the best way to apply Revamin Lash?**\n\n1.

Furthermore, it aids in the optimum anchoring of hair by stimulating the synthesis and organization of alpha 5 laminin and collagen IV adhesion molecules.\n\nAfter 30 days, a clinical trial of 30 participants revealed that eyelashes were 17 percent longer and 19 percent thicker due to the use of a product containing Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1.\n\n**Revamin Lash** **Ingredients:**\n\nThe rich composition of the Revamin Lash eyelash serum definitely distinguishes it from other products.

From genetic predispositions like androgenetic alopecia to environmental factors, stress, and nutritional deficiencies, the causes are varied, and traditional solutions often fall short, offering limited efficacy or undesirable side effects. But what if there was a more natural, targeted, and profound way to rejuvenate your hair follicles and reclaim a fuller, healthier mane? Enter peptides ‚Äì the unassuming yet powerful signaling molecules poised to redefine the landscape of hair restoration. This isn't just about slowing hair loss; it's about fostering genuine follicle health from the ground up, ushering in a new era of proactive and effective solutions.\n\n## The Hair Loss Dilemma: Why Traditional Approaches Often Miss the Mark\n\nFor decades, the battle against hair loss has largely relied on a handful of conventional treatments. Minoxidil, a topical vasodilator, aims to improve blood flow to the scalp and stimulate follicles, but its effects are often temporary and require continuous application. Finasteride, an oral medication, works by blocking DHT, a hormone linked to male pattern baldness, but carries potential systemic side effects. Hair transplant surgery, while offering a permanent solution for some, is invasive, costly, and depends on donor hair availability.\n\nThe common thread among these traditional methods is their reactive nature and broad-stroke approach. They might address symptoms but often fail to tackle the intricate cellular and molecular imbalances that contribute to follicle miniaturization and hair thinning. Many individuals seek alternatives that are less invasive, have fewer side effects, and promote sustainable, long-term hair health rather than just temporary growth. This is where the precision and biological intelligence of peptides shine.\n\n## What Are Peptides and How Do They Relate to Hair?\n\nAt their core, **peptides are short chains of amino acids**, the building blocks of proteins. Unlike proteins, which are long and complex, peptides are smaller and more agile, allowing them to act as highly specific biological messengers. They occur naturally throughout the body, playing crucial roles in virtually every physiological process, from hormone regulation and immune response to cell growth and repair.\n\nIn the context of hair, peptides function as sophisticated communicators, instructing cells within the hair follicle to perform specific tasks. They can signal for increased blood flow, reduce inflammation, stimulate the production of essential proteins, or even extend the hair growth cycle. By interacting with cellular receptors, peptides can modulate complex biological pathways that are directly relevant to the health, vitality, and growth of hair follicles. Their ability to deliver precise, targeted instructions makes them incredibly promising for addressing the multi-faceted nature of hair loss.\n\n## Peptides for Hair Restoration: A Deeper Dive into the Mechanism\n\nThe true power of peptides lies in their ability to influence the delicate ecosystem of the hair follicle. They don't just \"grow hair\"; they optimize the environment for healthy growth by addressing underlying issues.\n\n### Stimulating Follicle Growth and Proliferation\n\nCertain peptides act as potent growth factors, directly encouraging hair follicle cells (dermal papilla cells, keratinocytes) to proliferate and differentiate. For instance, **GHK-Cu (Copper Peptides)**, one of the most well-researched peptides, has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, essential components of a healthy scalp and hair structure. More critically, GHK-Cu promotes **angiogenesis** ‚Äì the formation of new blood vessels. A robust blood supply is vital for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the hair follicles, which are among the most metabolically active cells in the body. Improved circulation directly translates to better nourished, stronger follicles capable of producing thicker hair.\n\n### Reducing Inflammation and Oxidative Stress\n\nChronic inflammation and oxidative stress in the scalp can significantly impede hair growth and even lead to follicle damage. Conditions like seborrheic dermatitis or even general environmental stressors can create an inflammatory environment. Many peptides, including GHK-Cu, possess **powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties**. By neutralizing free radicals and dampening inflammatory pathways, these peptides create a healthier micro-environment for follicles to thrive, reducing the likelihood of premature hair loss and promoting repair.\n\n### Extending the Anagen (Growth) Phase\n\nHair growth occurs in a cycle with three main phases:\n*   **Anagen (Growth Phase):** Hair actively grows.\n*   **Catagen (Transition Phase):** Hair growth stops.\n*   **Telogen (Resting Phase):** Hair sheds.\n\nIn individuals experiencing hair loss, the anagen phase often shortens, leading to thinner, shorter hairs that shed prematurely. Certain peptides are being explored for their ability to **prolong the anagen phase** and delay the onset of the catagen phase. This means hair stays in its active growth cycle for longer, resulting in more hair density and length over time. Peptides can achieve this by influencing signaling pathways that regulate cell division and survival within the follicle, essentially telling the hair to \"keep growing.\"\n\n### Improving Scalp Health and Blood Circulation\n\nA healthy scalp is the foundation for healthy hair. Peptides can contribute to overall scalp vitality by:\n*   **Enhancing blood flow:** As mentioned with GHK-Cu, increased circulation ensures follicles receive ample nutrients and oxygen.\n*   **Modulating the scalp microbiome:** While research is ongoing, some peptides may help balance the microbial environment of the scalp, preventing conditions that can hinder hair growth.\n*   **Strengthening the skin barrier:** A robust skin barrier protects the scalp from irritants and infections, further supporting follicle health.\n\n## Key Peptides Gaining Traction in Hair Restoration\n\nThe field of peptide research for hair is rapidly expanding, with several compounds showing significant promise:\n\n*   **GHK-Cu (Copper Peptides):** Often considered the gold standard in cosmetic peptides for hair and skin. Its multifaceted benefits include stimulating collagen production, promoting angiogenesis, acting as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, and potentially reactivating dormant follicles. It's commonly found in topical serums and shampoos.\n*   **Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1:** This peptide is frequently incorporated into hair care formulations. It's believed to improve hair follicle anchorage by strengthening the dermal-epidermal junction and promoting the proliferation of keratinocytes, leading to stronger, less brittle hair.\n*   **Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3 (Capixyl‚Ñ¢):** This biomimetic peptide is designed to target the root causes of hair loss, particularly those related to DHT and inflammation. It works by inhibiting the 5-alpha reductase enzyme (which converts testosterone to DHT) and reducing inflammatory cytokines, thereby improving hair density and thickness.\n*   **Palmitoyl Tripeptide-38 (Matrixyl¬Æ synthe'6‚Ñ¢):** While primarily known for its anti-aging effects on skin, this peptide can also contribute to scalp health by supporting the synthesis of essential matrix components like collagen and hyaluronic acid, indirectly creating a healthier environment for hair growth.\n*   **Growth Factor Mimics:** Newer peptides are being developed that mimic the action of natural growth factors (like FGF, EGF, IGF-1) that are crucial for hair follicle development and cycling. These are often proprietary blends and represent the cutting edge of peptide science in this area.\n\n## Advantages of Peptide-Based Hair Treatments\n\nThe emergence of peptides offers compelling advantages over traditional hair loss solutions:\n\n*   **Targeted Action:** Peptides work by specifically signaling biological pathways, leading to more precise and effective interventions.\n*   **Reduced Side Effects:** Because many peptides are biomimetic (mimicking natural body compounds) or are naturally occurring, they tend to have a favorable safety profile with fewer systemic side effects compared to pharmaceutical drugs.\n*   **Non-Invasive Options:** The majority of peptide hair treatments are available as topical serums, shampoos, or in conjunction with microneedling, making them highly accessible and non-invasive.\n*   **Synergistic Potential:** Peptides can be combined with other therapies (e.g., PRP, low-level laser therapy) to enhance overall results and provide a more comprehensive approach to hair restoration.\n*   **Focus on Follicle Health:** Rather than just stimulating temporary growth, peptides aim to restore and maintain the long-term health and function of the hair follicle itself.\n\n## The Future Landscape: What's Next for Peptides in Hair Restoration?\n\nThe journey for peptides in hair restoration is still evolving, but the trajectory is exciting. We can anticipate:\n\n*   **Personalized Peptide Formulations:** As research advances, it's likely we'll see more diagnostic tools that identify an individual's specific hair loss pathways, leading to custom-blended peptide solutions.\n*   **Enhanced Delivery Systems:** Innovations in nanotechnology and delivery methods will improve the penetration and efficacy of topical peptide applications, ensuring they reach their target cells more effectively.\n*   **Integration with Regenerative Medicine:** Peptides will increasingly be combined with other cutting-edge regenerative therapies like stem cell treatments and exosome therapy to amplify their regenerative effects on hair follicles.\n*   **Broader Accessibility:** As clinical evidence mounts and production scales, peptide-based hair treatments are expected to become more widely available and potentially more affordable.\n*   **New Peptide Discoveries:** The vast world of peptides is still being explored. Expect new peptides with novel mechanisms of action to emerge, offering even more targeted solutions for various types of hair loss.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe quest for effective hair restoration has reached a pivotal moment, and peptides are leading the charge. Moving beyond symptomatic relief, these intelligent biomolecules offer a paradigm shift towards truly regenerative and health-focused solutions for hair follicles. By harnessing the body's own communication systems, peptides are proving to be a game-changer, fostering an environment where hair can not only regrow but thrive with renewed vitality.\n\nIf you're seeking a sophisticated, science-backed approach to addressing hair thinning or loss, exploring peptide-based therapies is a compelling next step. Always consult with a qualified dermatologist or healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific needs and to ensure you choose reputable, high-quality products. The future of hair restoration is here, and it‚Äôs signaling a new era of hope and healthy hair.",

        "body": "There aren't any prostaglandins in it based on that ingredient list. I don't think they would put any prostaglandins in something applied directly to the lash, either. Because that would greatly increase the risk of getting it inside your eye, which can increase the risk of adverse effects. Usually prostaglandins have \"prost\" somewhere in the name....bimatoprost (Latisse), isopropyl cloprostenate, fluprostenol, ethylcloprostenolamide, etc.\n\nSeems to mostly be plant oils and extracts along with aloe, vitamin E, panthenol, and allantoin, as well as a couple of peptides and hydrating ingredients.
