That block is then immersed in a heated blend of lithium chloride salt and a solvent known as dimethylacetamide. This causes the cellulose (and remaining lignin) to swell, expanding inwards to fill the lumen.\n\nIn a final step, the processed wood is left to air-dry at room temperature for 10 hours. As it does so, it uniformly shrinks inwards from all sides, but maintains its original length.\"\n\n",

    "body": "Today I wanted to show you how to make Cheung Fun, Cantonese Rolled Rice Noodles. This dish’s most commonly known in the West from it’s presence at morning Dim Sum, but it’s cultural footprint extends far beyond that. It’s a hyper common breakfast and street snack not only all around Guangdong, but also throughout China and Southeast Asia.\n\nCheung Fun is, at its core, rice blended into a batter and steamed. Depending on where you are, it’s usually smothered in some sort of sauce; depending on how you like it, it’s usually stuffed with some sort of filling. \n\nHere’s the complication though: Cheung Fun can’t be made with run-of-the-mill white rice – it’s far too sticky. Even varieties with low levels of amylopectin would still result in a hot mess of a rolled rice noodle. Cheung Fun must be made using *aged* rice. Why? I’ll let the venerable Harold McGee take over: \n\n>As any rice sits for months, in the warehouse or in the kitchen cabinet, its cooked texture gets progressively firmer and less sticky.\n\n>These changes are probably the result of a number of factors, including the breakdown of grain oils into free fatty acids, which form very stable, hard complexes with starch molecules. A Japanese team looked at what happens to rice during storage, and found that normally dissolvable proteins at the rice surface become oxidized and undissolvable. They were able to reverse the increased firmness and decreased stickiness of the cooked texture by adding a chemical reducing agent, sodium sulfite, to the cooking water (to reverse the oxidation), or by abrading away the surface of the aged grain. \n\nNow, I know this presents an obvious sourcing issue. We live in China, we can buy a Chinese aged rice that’s used specifically for this dish. It’d clearly be incredibly lame for a recipe writer to say “Critical ingredient here? Completely unavailable outside Asia, tough nuts.” So if you look at most recipes online, you’ll find that they tend to use a combination of a few different flours and starches: rice powder, together with some sort of combination of wheat starch, cornstarch, mungbean starch, and tapioca starch. \n\nAnd it’s not insane or inauthentic to go that route – cheaper Cheung Fun stalls in China tend to use a pre-packaged “Cheung Fun mixes” that’s more or less a blend of the above starches. It’s not wrong – it’s just not as good. And I mean, you know… sometimes you just can’t replicate the best versions of certain dishes half a world away in a home kitchen. For some foods, it’s just not in the cards.\n\nBut we were not so easily placated. I was screwing around looking at the science of what was actually going on regarding aging of rice, and I was struck by the fact that all rice varieties seem to go through the same process regardless of whether its short grain or long grain, sticky or not. And there is *one* sort of aged rice that people can reliably source in the West: aged Basmati.\n\nIn India, aged Basmati’s prized because it makes for long, loose, separate grains. It certainly wouldn’t seem a good substitute for Chinese rice at first glance – the latter’s vastly stickier. But we decided to give it a whirl anyway. Fired up the steamer, and subbed the aged Chinese rice one-to-one with aged Basmati. \n\nThe verdict? Not only did aged Basmati work flawlessly, it was **better** than the aged Chinese rice. The rice fragrance was clear and noticeable… obvious in hindsight I suppose, as basmati’s renowned for it’s aroma (the literal Chinese name for basmati’s “Indian fragrant rice”). Texturally? Completely on point. Smooth, slippery, but still had a little bite. Perfect for a Cheung Fun.\n\n[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/cW8lJ45r8SE).\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nMakes two servings.\n\n1.\t*Aged Basmati -or- aged zhanmi (两年粘米).* So right, just in case you happen to be in China or something, the specific variety of rice used is aged zhanmi from Zengcheng, which’s right outside of Guangzhou. Zhanmi has it’s own fascinating history (it’s derived from Champa rice), but I’ll spare you :) For the aged Basmati, for reference the specific brand that we used was Kohinoor. I would imagine that Thai aged Jasmine would also work, but we didn’t test it.\n\n2.\t*For the batter(s): 300g ice cold water for the 90% blend, 60g water and 100g hot boiled water for the 10% blend; 5g peanut oil to combine.* So right, we’ll end up separating the rice – the vast majority (90%) will be blended with 300g cold water; the remaining’ll be blended with 60g water and 100g hot boiled water to slightly gelatinize the starch. Right before cooking, we’ll mix both together and whisk in 5g peanut oil.\n\n3.\t*Beef loin (牛外脊肉), 100g.* The filling we’re going with’s beef, basically because that’s our favorite. This’ll be sliced super thin and marinated.\n\n4.\t*Marinade for the beef: 2 tbsp water, 1/8 tsp baking soda (苏打粉), ¼ tsp salt, ½ tsp sugar, ½ tsp cornstarch (生粉), ¼ tsp light soy sauce (生抽), ½ tsp liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒/绍兴酒), ½ tsp oyster sauce (蚝油), then coated with 1 tsp peanut oil (花生油).* Very similar to a basic marinade, but with a few exceptions. First, beef’s quite dry, so you’ll want to add in some water to let it absorb moisture. Second, especially because we’re steaming this, you’ll want something in there to help tenderize things. Usually we’re not the biggest fans of using baking soda in marinades for taste reasons, but I felt it’d be unreasonable to ask you to source papain (Chinese meat tenderizer powder). Last, we’re tossing in oyster sauce too – it’s optional, but it goes great with beef.\n\n5.\t*Jiuhuang Yellow Chives (韭黄) -or- scallions (葱), 40g.* Together with the beef we tossed in some jiuhuang yellow chives. If you’re not familiar with jiuhuang, they’re Chinese chives (i.e. jiucai) that’ve grown deprived of sunlight. They’ve got this real mellow flavor that’s quite dissimilar to Chinese chives. While it’s an awesome ingredient, I figure it’s probably really tough to source abroad. Scallions are also pretty classic here. Cut into 1 cm sections if you’re using jiuhuang, ½ cm sections if using scallions.\n\n6.\t*For the Cheong Fun soy sauce: 200g hot, boiled water; 20g sugar; 100g light soy sauce (生抽); 20g fish sauce (鱼露).* Ok, so there’s a few different versions of the Cheong Fun soy sauce. This’s sort of a quick-and-easy one we used, but I’ll toss a couple more options down in the notes below. I know you might be thrown by the addition of fish sauce – while it’s more of a minor sauce, it’s definitely around in Guangdong. That said, we used Vietnamese fish sauce here, mostly because Phu Quoc fish sauce might be the best ingredient ever and I’d drink that shit straight up if I could.\n\n7.\t*Peanut oil (花生油), 20g.* We’ll be cooking the peanut oil to improve its taste, then brushing it on. \n\n**Process:**\n\nBefore we get into it, we gotta go over some equipment.\n\nCheung Fun shops have these special dedicated machines that billow hot steam up through a very large perforated sheet. We don’t own one… and something tells me that you don’t either. So instead, we’ll be using an oversized steaming tray in a large wok. \n\nAt least when it came to our steaming tray though, it has a… slightly uneven surface. Like, there’s bumps and grooves. It makes this whole task a bit more annoying, but it still totally works. More important though would be the corresponding wok size – our wok’s 35cm, and especially for this dish I’d heavily recommend using something similarly sized (or larger).\n\nEDIT: /u/Costco1L recommends a wok splatter screen. Excellent suggestion, would be better than a steaming try for sure.\n\nSecond, there’s two primary methods of making Cheung Fun: the cloth method and the tray method. The very best Cheong Fun’s made using the cloth method – we’ve come this far in getting aged rice, might as well finish the job right. Unlike steaming the Cheung fun in a tray, the cloth can breathe and allows for much faster, more even cooking.\n\nThe issue though? The restaurants don’t use a run-of-the-mill cotton cloth. Cheung Fun cloth’s made of dacron, which’s relatively non-stick. Assuming you can’t get dacron though, any food safe oilcloth or polyester fabric would work in a pinch. We actually tested doing this on a polyester cloth and it worked great – we just were uh… pretty skeptical that the printed polyester was actually food safe, so we swapped to a dacron Cheung Fun cloth for the video.\n\nThat said, feel free to use the tray method. It’s common enough – the only issue is that it tends to make for thicker Cheung Fun. We used a baking tray, but ideal would be something as thin as possible.\n\nFor all of this stuff, feel free to MacGyver your own solution. Wanna lodge a chafing pan over some gas burners, cut some perforated metal to fit, and use that? Awesome. \n\n1.\t*Rinse the rice.* Rinse the rice for ~2 minutes until the water turns translucent. \n\n2.\t*Soak the rice overnight.* Fill your bowl of rice to about an inch over the rice, then let it soak for at least eight hours. The overnight soak’ll soften the rice so that we can actually blend it later.\n\n\n3.\t*Drain the rice, then split it into two bowls – one that contains roughly 90% of the rice, and one that contains about 10% of the rice.* Splitting the rice doesn’t need to be an exact science – you could even eyeball it.\n\n4.\t*In a blender, toss in 90% of the rice together with 300g of cold water. Blend on high – using the smoothie setting if you got it – for three minutes. Strain it through a mesh strainer, then toss in the fridge.* The smoothie or puree setting seems to blend this together a bit more evenly.  Keeping this stuff in the fridge’s more important if you’re in a hot climate – if things are a bit too sultry, the mixture will start to ferment and sour.\n\n\n5.\t*In a blender, toss in the remaining 10% of the rice together with 60g of water. Blend on high – smoothie setting if possible – for one minute. Then add 100g of hot, boiled water and blend for another two minutes. Strain through a mesh strainer, then toss in the fridge.* The hot water gelatinizes the starch in the rice, allowing for a slightly more translucent end result. If you’re feeling lazy, just blend all the rice together with 460g of room temp water.  You’ll still get a nice end result.\n\n6.\t*Thinly slice the beef against the grain.* You’ll want the beef to be as thin as reasonably possible. Don’t worry too much if the beef sort of comes apart into smaller pieces – that’s fine for a Cheong Fun. Thick beef would be inedible.\n\n\n7.\t*Mix in the marinade, stir for ~1 min with your hands, then ‘dat’ for ~30 seconds. Let it marinate for at least 20 minutes.* So once you toss in all of the marinade, you’ll need to mix it thoroughly into order to let the water absorb into the beef. Then in order to give it a bit of a smoother texture, ‘dat’ the beef. What do I mean by ‘dat’? Take all the beef, and continuously slam it against the bowl for 30 seconds or so. Why does this work? No clue, honestly. Afterwards, let it marinate for at least twenty minutes – you could also alternatively do this the night before, it might just get slightly ‘mealy’ with the long marinade.\n\n8.\t*Slice the jiuhuang yellow chives -or- scallions.* If using Jiuhuang, you only use the middle section of the jiuhuang. Chop off the white end, chop off the wilted end, then cut into 1 cm pieces. If using scallions, slice in ½ cm pieces.\n\n\n9.\t*Prepare the Cheung Fun soy sauce: mix in the sugar with the hot boiled water, then add in the light soy sauce and the fish sauce.* Set aside.\n\n10.\t*Remove the two batters from the fridge, stir each, combine and toss in the 5g peanut oil. Whisk together.* The rice powder has a nasty tendency to settle, so give it all a stir before you do anything important.\n\n\n11.\t*Prepare the cooked peanut oil: toss the peanut oil in a small pot, then heat it up til smoking. Then shut off the heat and reserve.* Cooking the peanut oil brings out the nuttiness of the oil.\n\n12.\t*Get a pot of water to a rapid boil, then give the batter another stir.* You’ll want your steaming set-up to be rolling at full blast, and be sure to give the batter a stir before each steaming.\n\n\n13.\t*If using the cloth method: take a damp cloth and lay over the steamer. Pour in 2 ladles, ~1/3 cup, of batter. Sprinkle on a small amount of jiuhuang/scallions and beef in a rough 'line' in the center of the cloth. Steam covered for one minute, then take it out and let it rest for another 30 seconds. Then carefully pull the rice roll off the cloth with a bench scraper, roll it up, and chop into four pieces.* Ok, I know that was a mouthful. When you’re pulling the roll off, you’ll probably need to do some ‘scraping’ at the very beginning but once you get started the roll should come straight off. If your steaming surface was uneven like ours was, it’ll probably be pretty ugly at that point – don’t panic, just roll the sucker up and after a couple chops it’ll still look rather nice.\n\n14.\t*If using the tray method: preheat the tray for 2-5 minutes in the steamer, then oil it. Pour in 2 ladles, ~1/3 cup, of batter. Sprinkle on a small amount of jiuhuang/scallions and beef in a rough 'line' in the center of the cloth. Steam covered for two minutes, then take it out and let it rest for 15 seconds. Roll the Cheung Fun up, and chop into four pieces.* So if you’re working with the tray method, the pre-heating basically really need to be only done with the very first steam you do. We pre-heated ours for 5 minutes as it’s a rather thick baking tray.\n\n\n15.\t*After four steamings, prepare a serving by first brushing it with some of the cooked peanut oil.*\n\n16.\t*Smother it all with the Cheung Fun soy sauce, and devour.* \n\n**Note on different sort of seasoned soy sauces:**\n\nFigured it might be nice to give you a few other options here. This first one’s from a Dim Sum chef in Hong Kong, and the second one’s one that we bumped into in our research. The last recipe is from the steamed fish with soy sauce post we tossed here like a year and a half back – that stuff’s also interchangeable here.\n\n*Option 1:* 125g light soy sauce, 25g dark soy sauce, 50g rock sugar, 12g MSG, 15g chicken bouillon powder, 10g Maggi soy sauce, 12g fish sauce, 40g water, 10g scallion, 10g shallot, 10g sliced ginger, 10g black cardamom, 1 star anise, 1 bay leaf.\n\nFry the scallion, shallot, and ginger in 5g lard and then add the remaining ingredients. Cover, and simmer for ~20 minutes.\n\n*Option 2:* 100g light soy sauce, 25g water, 25g sugar, 1 inch smashed ginger, ¼ stalk of celery cut into chunks, 1 inch carrot cut into small chunks, 2 inches leek, 1/8 of an onion.\n\nFry the onion, leek, carrot, celery and ginger in ~5g peanut oil then add the remaining ingredients. Cover, and simmer for ~20 minutes.\n\n*Option 3:* 10 tbsp stock -or- 2 tsp stock concentrate mixed with 10 tbsp hot, boiled water, 6 tbsp light soy sauce, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine, 1 tsp toasted sesame oil.\n \nDissolve the stock concentrate (if using) into the hot water along with the sugar. Mix in the remainder of the ingredients.\n\nAgain, there’s tons of variants. If you know one you like, share it!",

    "body": " \n\nFirst off, did you know that those 3 names are all the exact same kind of mushroom? All 3 of these (the most common mushrooms to be found in any grocery store in the western world), are actually just [Agaricus bisporus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricus_bisporus), the only difference being their age. Buttons are the youngest, and portobellos are the oldest.\n\nI was watching a recent Joe Rogan Experience recently ([\\# with Paul Stamets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPqWstVnRjQ)), and towards the end, Paul mentioned something about portobellos being not that good to eat, the completely refused to explain why, stating that it would put his life at risk. After talking about his visits from black helicopters, and hassles with the patent office and FDA, you know he's already on quite a few folks' radar. I paused the episode at that point, talked to [@dbroze](https://hive.blog/@dbroze) about it a bit, then dove into the research, coming up with a few important safety facts for Agaricus bisporus mushrooms.\n\n*It's important to note that Agaricus b. is* ***the*** *most widely commercially produced mushroom on the market, with India exporting over 15,000 tonnes per year (mostly to the US)... Needless to say there are some vested interested who may not want anything questionable said about them.*\n\n \n\n# Make sure you cook your mushrooms!\n\nThese mushrooms contain agaritine & hydrazine, both of which have been found to be cancer-causing, but are luckily both heat-unstable. As Paul says in the video, you should cook all your mushrooms, but especially these ones. If you are boiling these mushrooms, be sure to toss out the water afterwards, as some of the agaritine will be extracted into it.\n\n#### Cooking Types & Reduction of Agaritine:\n\nBoiling\n\n* 20-25% degraded after 5 minutes\n* 90% degraded after 2 hours\n\nDry Baking\n\n* \\~25% degraded\n\nFrying\n\n* 35-70% degraded\n\n# Never buy mushrooms from China\n\nStudies have shown mushrooms (as well as rice) from China coming back with levels of arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium. Sometimes over the maximum amounts legally allowed, and for me personally and traceable amounts are too much. These mushrooms will often also be treated with sodium sulfite as an \"anti-browning agent\", which has been known to cause respiratory side effects.\n\n# The older mushrooms are better\n\nThe concentration of hydrazine in button mushrooms decreases with the age of the mushroom, meaning a portobello will have less in it than a cremini, and a cremini will have less than a button. No matter which you're going for, make sure to cook it. Maybe mention something to the people running that salad bar with raw mushrooms in it?\n\n# Only eat organic mushrooms\n\nIf you hadn't noticed, mushrooms are quite porous, they're almost like little sponges. While this makes them AMAZING to cook with, just soaking up flavors, it also makes them extremely good at absorbing whatever has been sprayed on them or around them. This means any of those wonderfully toxic Monsatan products they're getting sprayed with, are likely making it right to your dinner plate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*This mushroom contains compounds that inhibit the enzyme aromatase. Aromatase is associated with tumor growth. Compounds inhibiting aromatase have potential for the treatment of breast cancer(Bankhead, 1999). A diet of mushrooms in mice with implanted tumors showed a decrease in aromatase as mushroom consumption increased. However, Agaricus brunnescens contains hydrazines, carcinogenic compounds that have been thought to dissipate only from prolonged, high temperature heating. More than 80 percent of known hydrazines are carcinogenic. The most notable carcinogenic hydrazine from this mushroom is agaritine, a powerful mutagen, which is activated by the mushroom enzyme tyrosinase, making it heat stable. Enzymes in the digestive system convert agaritine into carcinogenic by-products. The chemical culprits worthy of concern are: 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenylhydrazines and 4(hydroxymethyl)benzene diazonium ions(Walton et al. 1997). Free radicals can also activate Agaricus hydrazines into highly carcinogenic subconstituents (tomasi et al 1987) as well as catalytic processes in the kidneys (Price et al. 1996). Hence, there are several modes of activating agaritine into highly carcinogenic derivatives.*\n\n*The damaging effects of agaritine's derivatives may be partially suppressed by the mushroom's antioxidants, which, in turn help create host-generated superoxide dismutases (SODs), and the activity of aromatase inhibitors. Walton et al. 1998 asserted, however, that the mutagenic and pre-mutagenic compounds are not affected by quick cooking(10 minutes at 437F/225C) but are only slightly reduced by prolonged heat treatment in boiling water for 4 hours at 212F/100C). A study of blanched, canned mushrooms showed that the agaritine content was reduced tenfold in comparison to fresh mushrooms, from 229mg/kg to 15-18mg/kg(Andersson et al. 1999). However, this reduction may have been due to leaching of the hydrazines into the surrounding water used for blanching in combination with prolonged, high pressure steaming processing used for canning. Another report by Sharman et al. 1990, found most fresh samples of this mushroom had agaritine levels within the range of 80-225mg/kg but with one dried sample having 6,520 mg/kg, a comparatively high level. This result suggests that agaritine production may be a strain specific trait, as this one dried, sliced sample had more than 8 times the agaritine content of other samples in this same study. In contrast, dried Shiitake mushrooms, Lentinula edodes, have either undetectable or extremely low levels of agaritines, in the 0.082 mg/kg range (Stijve et al. 1986; Hashida et al. 1990). Hashida's study reported marked reduction of agaritines from boiling water at 212F(100C) for 10 minutes, a report in direct contradiction of Walton's 1998 study.A Swiss report estimated that with the average consumption of 4 grams per day of Agaricus bisporus(=Agaricus brunnescens) the lifetime increase in cancer risk would be approximately two cases per hundred thousand lives(Shepard et al. 1995). In a metropolitan area of twenty million residents, approximately the size of Los Angeles, two hundred people would be expected to get cancer in their lifetime from eating Agaricus brunnescens mushrooms, all other factors being equal.*\n\n*However, other investigations have questioned the cause and effect relationship of agaritine in Button mushrooms and its mutagenic properties(Pilegaard et al. 1997; Matsumoto eet al. 1991; Papaparaskeva et al. 1991; and Pool-Kobel 1990). Benjamin 1995 noted that early studies are controversial and potentially flawed. One study had the intravenous introduction of mushrooms into mice. Another study showed that mice implanted with cancer cells (Sarcoma 180) and then fed dried mushrooms showed inhibited tumor growth(Mori et al. 1986). More recent studies reconfirm that a diet of this mushroom, both raw and baked, induced tumors in mice(Toth et al. 1998)*\n\n*The cited research is highly controversial and raises concerns about the human consumption of Agaricus brunnescens as a health food. For years, the conventional wisdom was that hydrazines would be destroyed with cooking. Anti-cancer polysaccharides, aromatase-inhibiting compounds, and antioxidants known from Agaricus brunnescens(Kweon 1998), may neutralize the carcinogenic effects of hydrazines, but in my opinion, the jury is still out on this issue. Eating this mushroom raw, especially with free radical inducing foods, is definitely not recommended. And yet, in the United States, up to 80 percent of all Button mushrooms consumed are eaten uncooked. I am disturbed that the most commonly cultivated mushroom in the world has few studies authenticating its beneficial medicinal properties, in stark contrast to the numerous studies on Shiitake, Maitake, Reishi, Yun Zhi, and others. The Portobello mushroom may be gourmet, but in absence of scientific studies, I doubt that, at this time, Agaricus brunnescens can be considered medicinally beneficial.*\n\n*What to do? The financial future of the Button/Portobello industry may well depend on recognizing the risks, and aggressively developing low agaritine or agaritine-free strains. As analyses have shown more than an eight-fold difference in the concentrations of agaritine in Agaricus brunnescens mushrooms, clearly some strains already in cultivation are much lower in agaritine content than others. Pursuing low agaritine strains should be top research priority within the Agaricus industry, especially within the venue of the spawn producers. Given variations in agaritine levels in existing strains, a breeding program for creating agaritine free strains is a task preeminently achievable in the near future. Certainly the button mushroom industry has clear economic and ethical incentives for doing so.\"*\n\nResearch Links: [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2132000/), [2](https://www.mendeley.com/research-papers/carcinogenesis-studies-lyophilized-mushroom-agaricus-bisporus-mice/), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24206698), [4](https://decroissons.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/paul-stamets-growing-gourmet-and-medicinal-mushrooms-2000.pdf), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24112416), [6](https://mycotopia.net/topic/26538-carcinogenesis-buttoncriminiportabella-mushrooms/), [7](http://nhb.gov.in/report_files/Button_Mushroom/BUTTON%20MUSHROOM.htm)",

If the Agaricus industry would conduct a clinical study of their member farms and their employees, and compare their cancer rates relative to baseline populations, the looming questions as to whether Agaricus ingestion has net negative or positive effects could be put to rest. I think this responsibility is incumbent upon the Agaricus industry to finance and spearhead this study using unbiased, third party medical epidemiologists.\" By Paul Staments.",

I remember reading about a kind in France where it was served for years until people who ate too many within a certain time span got sick and they figured out they were poisonous. Big Shroom doesn’t want you to know though. /s\n\nEdit: If you want a rabbit hole start looking up what other vegetables have in them when not cooked (and some even when cooked). Examples: oxalates, goitrogens. I’m convinced that humans are meant to cook their plant matter, other than maybe salad which has been bred to have low amounts of compounds that cause issues compared to most leaves.",

    "body": "I've been evangelizing DIY ECN-2 for quite a while, and realized I'm typing out the same somewhat long-winded explanation over and over for individual people who ask. So I'm making this post primarily to have a destination to refer people to if they ask.\n\nMandatory disclaimers: I am not a chemist. I understand how the chemistry side of things in film development works only at a very layman's level. If I get something wrong here, I hope someone with better chemistry knowledge can help correct me.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\nYou should consider developing your own color film at home using ECN-2 chemistry that you mix yourself instead of from a kit. Why? Here are a few reasons besides the obvious advantages of cost savings, turnaround times, and in-house control of your final results:\n\n1. Developing C-41 film in ECN-2 chemistry, in my opinion, produces better results than developing ECN-2 film (even with remjet removed like Cinestill) in C-41 chemistry. Obviously that's subjective, but having tried both, I strongly prefer the former. For me, it makes sense to keep ECN-2 ingredients on hand, as they can be used to develop ANY type of color film I care to shoot, including slide film. The obvious exception here is if you plan on optically printing your C-41 negs via RA-4 - just use actual CD-4 developer if that's your intended use case. But if you're scanning, any small color casts can be easily corrected in post.\n2. ECN-2 chemistry uses CD-3 as the color developer, while C-41 uses CD-4. As it happens. E-6 slide films also use CD-3. This means you can use your ECN-2 chemistry (including bleach and fix), in combination with a black & white developer (like HC-110) to [develop slide film](https://www.reddit.com/r/Darkroom/comments/197a1cz/test_2_with_ecn2_chems_for_processing_ektachrome/) with [excellent results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Darkroom/comments/19ejulm/its_official_i_dont_need_to_buy_real_e6_chemistry/) and a higher degree of color accuracy than you could achieve using C-41 chemicals.\n3. In the USA (can't speak for anywhere else in the world), the ingredients are easy to source and inexpensive enough that you can mix up 250ml of developer (enough to develop 3 rolls of film before chemical exhaustion) for about $1.50 USD, give or take. This is cheap enough that I don't feel bad mixing it up and using one-shot for a single roll of 24 exposures. I actually keep several pre-mixed quanities of powder on hand in film canisters. Only the CD-3 powder needs to be kept separate from the rest during storage. When it's time to develop, I just dump a canister into 250ml of water, shake it up for a minute, and stick it in the hot water bath to heat up to temp. Gone are the days of saving up 12 exposed rolls of film so I can justify buying a kit. I no longer have to worry about shelf life.\n\nI used [this article](https://grainy.vision/blog/ecn-2-processing) (which I did not write) to get my recipes. The person who wrote it did a lot of the leg work for testing out and adapting Kodak's published formulas for use in a non-industrial setting.\n\nThat said, I have further adapted the recipes on that site to make smaller quantities, and I have found substitutes for (or simply omitted) ingredients that were expensive, difficult to source, or hazardous. So all the proprietary \"Kodak Anti-Fog\" and whatnot are absent from my recipes. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**1. Remjet pre-bath**\n\nI mix this up 500ml at a time and use at the same 105°F as the developer. It has a virtually infinite shelf life, and can probably handle something like 20 rolls of film before losing effectiveness. Handle the lye carefully, use gloves. With actual Vision3 that doesn't have the remjet removed, I get better results and have a much easier time getting the film totally free of remjet when I use this recipe, compared to any of the simpler \"just use baking soda\" type recipes out there. YMMV. Obviously this pre-bath isn't needed for films without remjet.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Borax|10g|\n|Sodium Sulfate|50g|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (lye)|0.5g|\n|Sodium Carbonate monohydrate (washing soda)|7.5g|\n|Distilled Water|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**2. Developer (250mL)**\n\nI use this one-shot. 250mL is enough for up to 3 rolls of 135-36 or 120 film (or sheets of 8x10 film). Even with just one roll of 35mm, 250mL is not enough liquid to cover the roll while at rest, which means you will need to use constant agitation to avoid uneven development. If you don't have a rotary developer or other automated solution, that just means you need to be inverting manually for the full duration of the developer step. The powders can all be pre-mixed and stored in a film canister, with the exception of CD-3, which will degrade if stored in contact with other ingredients. I keep my CD-3 in an airtight jar.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sodium Sulfite|0.5g|\n|Sodium Bromide|0.3g|\n|Sodium Carbonate monohydrate (washing soda)|7.5g|\n|Sodium Bicarbonate (baking soda)|0.675g|\n|CD-3|1g|\n|Distilled Water|Balance to 250mL|\n\n**3. Stop Bath (500mL)**\n\nI am not using the sulfuric acid-based stop bath from the linked article, despite Kodak's insistence that it's necessary. I have not seen any downsides. This amount of stop bath has virtually unlimited shelf life, and a conservative capacity estimate of 10 rolls. I keep it in liquid form and pour back into the bottle (recording the tally marks towards exhaustion) after each use.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Kodak Indicator Stop Bath|4.7mL|\n|Water (distilled not necessary)|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**4. Bleach (500mL)**\n\nAgain, I have simplified the recipe here. The ferricyanide is what's doing the work. I haven't found a need to use sulfuric acid in this recipe either. Shelf life here is basically unlimited; capacity is about 20 rolls of film. I use in the same way as stop bath (track exhaustion and re-use until I hit it).\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Potassium Ferricyanide|20g|\n|Sodium Bromide|12.5g|\n|Borax|0.75g|\n|Water (distilled not necessary)|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**5. Fixer (500mL)**\n\nSame story - keeps long enough that I don't worry about shelf life. Capacity of 10 rolls of film. Re-use until exhaustion.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Ammonium Thiosulfate (60%)|90.65mL|\n|Sodium Sulfite|5g|\n|Sodium Metabisulfite|4.2g|\n|Water (distilled not necessary)|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**6. Stabilizer (500mL)**\n\nColor stabilizer is a controversial topic. You can go read Photrio forums for a lively debate about whether it's needed, what substitutes for formaldehyde are most effective, which manufacturers did what cool tricks to avoid using formaldehyde, etc. As for me, I figure it's easy and inexpensive enough to mix a bit of formalin in with my final PhotoFlo rinse and just not worry about whether my films have been properly stabilized or not. All of my films (C-41, ECN-2, or E-6) get a final minute or two in the stabilizer, so I can be confident that the color dyes are as stable as possible. Do be extremely careful with formaldehyde (or formalin, as it's called when mixed in water). It's very nasty stuff.\n\nThis stabilizer has a shelf life of forever, and a capacity of roughly 20 films, to make a conservative estimate. Once nice benefit of mixing the formalin in with the final rinse is that it seems to kill anything that would otherwise try to grow in the PhotoFlo solution.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|PhotoFlo 200|2.5mL|\n|Formalin (37%)|5mL|\n|Distilled Water (ALWAYS use distilled here)|Balance to 500mL|\n\nThose are the recipes. The process I use is as follows:\n\n|Step|Temp|Time|Comments|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Pre-Bath|105°F|30s|Just use a few fills of 105°F water for C-41 films. The remjet-pre-bath for ECN-2. Vigorous agitation (I literally shake the tank) if handling remjet.|\n|Developer|105°F|3m for ECN-2, 5m for C-41|Constant agitation. Temperature is critical here, more than any other step.|\n|Stop Bath|95°F - 105°F|30s|No water rinse in between developer and stop - the stop much more quickly and effectively kills the developer action. Constant agitation preferred.|\n|Rinse|95°F - 105°F|3x tank fills|Agitate vigorously to get the stop bath off the film.|\n|Bleach|95°F - 105°F|3m|Constant agitation.|\n|Rinse|95°F - 105°F|3x tank fills|Agitatie vigorously to get the bleach off the film.|\n|Fixer|95°F - 105°F|3m|Constant agitation.|\n|Wash|I slowly decrease to room temp|6m|Wash in running water. If developing a film with remjet, use a latex/nitrile-gloved hand to carefully but very thoroughly rub off all traces of remjet under running water here. This can make or break the results - if you miss remjet during your final wash, it looks terrible in the scans.|\n|Stabilizer/Final Rinse|Room temp|1m|Very gentle agitation - you don't want bubbles if you can avoid them.|\n\nDespite the ways I've deviated from Kodak's published formulas and procedures, I have been getting excellent results. Hope you can enjoy the same benefits of doing this DIY! It's not as hard as it sounds.",

There is no rinse between the color developer bath and the pre-bleach, the formaldehyde is present in such a chemical form that the small amount of color developer that carries over will form the small amount of formaldehyde necessary to react with the film.",

    "body": "As the title suggests, this is my current sunscreen collection, and I'll be reviewing the products and mentioning the ones I love and the ones I don't ! (This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

The photrio forum contained a recipe from  sfaber17 that seems to be reliable, called C-41N. I gave it a shot. Here is the recipe for 500mL:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A short guide\\/recipe for home-brewed C-41](https://reddit.com/link/hwbkwr/video/rzve2kyj9kc51/player)\n\nDeveloper\n\n* Sodium Carbonate(Anhydrous)   -   14.6g\n* Sodium Sulfite(Anhydrous)   -   2.35g\n* Potassium Bromide(Anhydrous)   -   0.75g\n* Hydroxylamine Sulfate   -  1.25g\n* Potassium iodide   -  0.6mg\n* Sodium Bicarbonate   -  0.96g\n* CD4   -  2.6g\n\nStop bath\n\n* Vinaigre 14%   -  18mL\n* Sodium Sulfite(Anhydrous)   -  5g\n\nBleach\n\n* Potassium Ferricyanide(Anhydrous)   -  40g\n* Potassium Bromide(Anhydrous)    -  10g\n\nFixer\n\n* Ammonium Thiosulfate   -  48g\n* EDTA   -  0.5g\n* Sodium hydroxide   -  1.25g\n* Sodium bisulfite    -  6g\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou'll need a precise scale (0.01g precision at least) and a becher. I would recommand using a steering plate.\n\nI must say that I am quite happy with the result. The only sad thing is that I only had Kodacolor 200 to develop.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %.

    "body": " \n\n# TL;DR\n\nTogether with a friend, I attempted to make a substance that is able to discolour ink (commonly referred to as *Tintenkiller* or ink eradicator). I understand that not every fountain pen enthusiast is interested in this (and, admittedly, this post does at times become quite technical) but I nonetheless found it interesting enough to post here. This decision was mainly fueled by the lack of information that was out there on this subject, but I also hope that some of you will find this interesting. Lastly, I hope that the mods don't take offence at my posting this here. \n\n# Preamble\n\nI'm currently in my last year of high school, studying sciences/modern languages. As a project, we had to choose something scientific to investigate and then we were given roughly a week to perform all the necessary experiments. After some thinking, I decided to make an ink eradicator (basically a kind of marker that you can use on fountain pen ink to make it disappear). A friend decided to join in.\n\n# Desired product\n\nSome googling quickly made clear that the main component of a *Tintenkiller* is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). We could, of course, have just bought this (or used the powder that was already present in our school) but we decided to go the extra mile and try to make this compound ourselves.\n\n# Reaction\n\nWe considered various reactions but decided on the following as it was not too difficult to make and all the needed substances were already available at our school:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Reaction 1 + stoichiometry](https://preview.redd.it/mluubv8kwf0b1.png?width=251&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df0d810e0fbbe9ce2c2bf6b0ba8e63f3ec77c08)\n\n[Reaction 2 + stoichiometry](https://preview.redd.it/4h1aq9wnwf0b1.png?width=234&format=png&auto=webp&s=75469bcb5d822509e0cfc449f65b66a530c98f6e)\n\nThe first reaction is done in an Erlenmeyer (note that we required *concentrated* sulfuric acid; diluted wouldn't work). It produced SO2-gas, which escaped through a tube and consequently bubbled through a sodium carbonate (NaCO3) solution. This then reacted to give us our desired Na2SO3-solution.\n\n# Results\n\nNow comes the fun part: the results! The first thing we did was try if what we made actually worked. Note that we used Pelikan Königsblau (Royal Blue) as our standard blue ink. To our satisfaction, it did, though the discoloured ink had a slight yellowish tint (nothing too concerning, though). When we then compared our creation to actual Na2SO3-powder, we found out that what we had made was quite pure and acted very similarly to the pure form. As anyone who has used *Tintenkiller* will know, it only works on certain (blue) inks. To test this out, we added some to our standard Pelikan Königsblau, along with Montblanc Irish Green, Waterman Bleu Nuit and Pelikan Blau Schwarz (Blue Black). As said, Königsblau pretty much dissolves entirely. Irish Green, however, doesn't change colour at all due to it being green instead of blue. Surprisingly, Waterman Bleu Nuit maintained its colour very well; it only faded a bit due to dilution. Perhaps the coolest result was that of the Blue Black: it turned red.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Discoloured Pelikan Blue Black](https://preview.redd.it/wv0810zdwf0b1.jpg?width=369&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fcdd9723bb71d3caaaf9bd604ffc444d99d12b8)\n\nApparently, then, the *Tintenkiller* removed a certain part of the colour, but left another untouched. This was among our most fascinating results. We also discovered that it was supposedly possible to recolour the discoloured ink by adding either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or hydrochloric acid (HCl). As the former wasn't available to us, we limited ourselves to the latter, again using Pelikan Königsblau as our ink of choice. The result was quite nice:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Recoloured ink \\(above\\) vs discoloured ink \\(below\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rkzq4dwawf0b1.jpg?width=352&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=734d6d4bb57052a584ed126ac24e3f7454678249)\n\nLastly, we had heard that sodium sulfite is also used to dry fruits and is therefore present in raisins and dried apricots. Thus, by crushing these foods in water, we hoped to become a solution that would also work as a *Tintenkiller*. This, however, didn't work out very well. Perhaps we didn't take a very sophisticated to extracting the sodium sulfite from the fruits. \n\n# Closing\n\nI hope that some of you found this post interesting. Be sure to comment any remarks should you have them; we are by no means expert chemists and are open to criticism.",

I made a 1% sodium sulfite soltuion, and tried adding progressively 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16ml of this product to RA-4 developer, from a bellini kit, used one shot.\n\nThis is the same negative and the same filtration and the same paper as the last time, but it is a new batch of chemicals mixed from the same concentrate. \n\nAll these pictures are the *same* exposure time. Which maybe you would want to adjust as I think the Na2SO3 definitely makes the developer a bit less active. It does however really works as flatteing the image. \n\nI did not see an big appréciable color shift, unlike with the hydrogen peroxide that definitely created some sort of blue cast.\n\nThis was done all at 35 degrees C. I feel like I have needed *more* of the sodium sulfite to get a big impact than in the video made by The Naked Photographer about this technique.\n\nImages 2 to 6 are the scans of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16ml of additive added to the color developer.\n\nI probably should have increased exposure time as the density diminishes, but this definitely shows the flattening of the image. \n\n  \n",

And they've been doing it for months now.

A wash aid can be used to “neutralise” any fixer still in the base and make it more water soluble, easier to wash out.",

        "body": "Lab tech of 11 years here.\n \nDepends on the process. We’ve been through 3 C41 machines since I started. The Fuji 562 used a fix bath then a “super water” step, that was essentially a wash aid. Super toxic chemical too… Then we had a noritsu v50. Excellent machine, but it utilized two fix racks then two wash (flo) racks. Our newest investment is Colenta roller transport machine which is amazing. Very very high quality processing, and again, two fix racks, then three flo racks. So no, wash aid isnt needed for C41, so long as your wash is long/thorough enough.\n\nBlack and white film is different though. We use a small rotary machine and after a fix bath we go water, hypoclear, and a final water wash before flo. From my understanding and experience, hypoclear just reduces wash times to use less water. Yes, it’s archival because you’re mostly guaranteeing to never have retained silver. Is it strictly necessary? No, so long as your wash is long enough, but definitely doesn’t hurt.\n\nAnd for e-6, just a wash after the fix, no hypoclear. \n\nSo, was your lab doing it wrong? Yeah, but probably not anything detrimental, assuming the wash was long enough. Could you save a few bucks and skip it, probably?",

    "body": "Hey there everyone! Robert from Brooktree Film Lab here, excited to share a thrilling development with all of you: true ECN-2 film processing! This has been a dream project of mine for quite some time, and after some experimentation, I'm happy to say that it's finally a reality. Today, I'll take you on a journey through the process, from sourcing the chemicals to producing stunning results.\n\n\n**Introducing True ECN-2 Processing**\n\n\nIf you're a film photographer, you've probably heard of ECN-2 film processing. This method is known for delivering exceptional color tones and dynamic range, typically used for motion picture films. While adhering to Kodak's published recipe may seem complex and inaccessible for home processors, don't worry! I've come up with a simplified recipe that yields equally fantastic results.\n\n**Step One: Gathering the Essentials**\n\nBefore diving into the process, it's essential to gather all the necessary chemicals and supplies. I've put together a list of the items I used, although feel free to explore other options if you prefer:\n\n\nCD-3 Developer\n\nSodium Bromide\n\nSodium Sulfite\n\nPotassium Ferricyanide\n\nSodium Carbonate Mono\n\nSodium Bicarbonate (baking soda, not baking powder)\n\nAcetic Stop Bath (or household vinegar)\n\nC41 Fixer\n\nLab Scale\n\nCalibration Weights\n\nSampling Spoons\n\nMagnetic Stirrer\n\nCleaning Cloth (for remjet removal)\n\nPhoto-Flo or a wetting agent\n\n\n\n**Step Two: Preparing the Solutions**\n\n\nCreating the developer solution is the first crucial step. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\nMix 850ml of warm water (80-100°F).\n\nAdd 2g of Sodium Sulfite and 1.2g of Sodium Bromide.\n\nIncorporate 4g of CD-3, allowing it to mix for 10 minutes.\n\nIntroduce 30g of Sodium Carbonate Mono and 2.7g of Sodium Bicarbonate.\n\nTop up with water to reach a total volume of 1 liter.\n\nAllow the solution to rest for 24 hours before use.\n\n\nThis developer solution can process approximately 16 rolls of film, with an additional 3% processing time added per roll.\n\n\nNext, prepare the bleach solution:\n\n\nMix 900ml of warm water (90-100°F).\n\nAdd 40g of Potassium Ferricyanide (be cautious during this step).\n\nInclude 25g of Sodium Bromide.\n\nTop up with water to reach a total volume of 1 liter.\n\nThe stop bath can be easily prepared by mixing 250ml of household (3%) vinegar with 750ml of water.\n\n\nFor the fixer, follow the standard C41 fixer instructions, as they may vary based on the type and manufacturer.\n\n\n**Step Three: The Film Processing Process**\n\n\nNow comes the exciting part – processing the film! Follow these steps carefully:\n\n\nStart with a pre-wash using 90-100°F water mixed with a couple of tablespoons of Sodium Carbonate Mono. Allow the film to sit in it for around 15 seconds, swish it around, and then discard the water. Fill the tank with clean water at the same temperature, shake it for 15 seconds, and dispose of the water. Repeat this process until the water runs clear.\n\n\nPour the heated developer (106°F) into the tank and agitate it for 30 seconds. Afterward, agitate it for 10 seconds every minute until 3 minutes and 15 seconds have passed. Then pour the developer back into its container.\n\n\nQuickly pour the stop bath into the tank and agitate for 30 seconds to prevent color casts or uneven development.\nRinse the film thoroughly with warm water (90-100°F) until the water runs clear.\n\n\nBleach the film for at least 3 minutes at 100°F, agitating it for 30 seconds initially and then 10 seconds every minute thereafter.\nRinse the film again with warm water (90-100°F).\n\n\nFollow the fixing time recommended on the package for the C41 fixer to ensure complete fixing of the film.\n\n\nRinse the film a few more times. The last rinse should include the wetting agent.\n\n\nHang the film to dry.\n\n\nNow the hardish part, removing the rest of the remjet. Soak the cloth in the rinse water that you have in your tank (with the wetting agent) squeeze the excess water from the cloth, fold it over a couple of times and run it down the BACK of the film. (NEVER touch the emulsion side) Then rinse the cloth, dip it in the rinse water again, and run it down for a second or third time depending on how much remjet is left. Do a visual check and make sure that no remjet made it to the emulsion side. \n\n\nIf you see remjet on the emulsion, don't panic. Just put the film back on the reel and rewash it a time or two. The remjet will only stick to the emulsion if allowed to dry. Once you rewash the film re-hang and check again. \n\n\nAfter the film has dried you can either use a dedicated film scanner or set up a DSLR for scanning. I personally use a Frontier SP3000 at the lab, and the results are simply awesome.\n\n[Sample Photos](https://imgur.com/a/lEdGZTg)\n\n\nThis process was daunting for me, but honestly I am so blown away with how easy it was to get going. The results are 100x better than cross processing, and we will be offering this ECN-2 processing in the lab for people who don't want to mess with the mixing. We'll also be selling pre-rolled fresh 500T and 250D rolls again very soon, although there are a lot of options on eBay and Etsy for those of you who like options!\n\nI hope that this little guide helps you out, and encourages you to take the plunge and try to process your own ECN-2 rolls. Take your time, make sure temps are correct, and don't stress if something goes wrong. Feel free to ask for help if you need it!\n\nEdit: a shopping list with links (non-affiliate) are in a blog post on my website for those of you who want to know where I got all of these chemicals and lab supplies.",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’ve been lurking on here for some time and noticed you’re all super knowledgable about skincare. I need some basic 101 explanation on tret vs adapalene vs tazarotene since I’m being super confused. Always thought tret is the holy grail but now I’m seeing that adapalene and tazarotene are more potent with less side effects? Plus I don’t understand how in my country 🇵🇱tret and adapalene are prescription only but somehow you can get tazarotene 0.1% in a regular drugstore chain. It says it’s a spot treatment only. Can please someone verify if I can use it as an anti aging treatment and on my quite acne prone skin (not big acne but lots of small closed comedones) ?\n\nIs this product an actual anti aging treatment you’ve all been talking about? If so, then how to use it as an anti aging and anti breakout treatment? \n\nPrice of this particular product on the pic is 110 PLN ~ 26 EUR\n\nthank you all for your help, energy and time! \n\nOnce again, I wanna send hugs of appreciation cause I’ve learned a lot from you on this sub! And, I applaud the hustle 👏👏 \n\n\nIngredients: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, PANTHENOL, DIMETHICONE, STEARETH-2, PPG-15 STEARYLM ETHER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL DICAPRYLATE/DICPRATE, PROPANEDIOL, STEARETH-21, POTASSIUM AZELOYL DIGLYCINTE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BUTYROSPERMUM PRKII BUTTER, NIGELLA SATIVA SEED OIL, AVENA SATIVA KERNELL OIL, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, CHLORPHENESIN, XANTHAN GUM, HYDROGENATED POLYDECENE, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, TAZAROTENE, SODIUM GLUCONATE, SODIUM SULFITE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BHT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIDECETH-6",

Some people have preference for one over the other, but that's based on their experience with both substances. You can use taz for anti ageing & anti breakout purposes. \n\nI tried to understand this Boderm product too and it looks like tazarotene is not on the list of substances banned in cosmetic products?!

        "body": "I have no idea why tazarotene is OTC in PL. It's probably more to do with Boderm product than tazarotene itself. It's prescription only in the US, which is where they also did the majority of its clinical studies. The reason why tret is considered the HG is because it has been clinically studied the most, i.e. its efficacy has been demonstrated for decades. Plus, it's widely available and its formulation has come a looong way. Now, when it comes to effectiveness, you have to consider both the drug's effectiveness and irritation. If a drug is effective, but it irritates the hell out of your skin, the overall effect will not be as good and you will be less likely to continue with the treatment consistently (they take at elast 3 months of consistent use to see the result). The example is tazarotene, which is apparently very irritating to use (at least as observed in the clinical studies), so people are less likely to stick to it, and thus it seems less effective than, say, tretinoin, on paper, even though it should be more effective theoretically. In short, you need to take your skin into account. Is your skin dry? sensitive? have you used other active (bezoyl peroxide, salycilic acid, etc) before? What is your skin concerns? Do you have a solid skin routine? This is why for young people with mild acne, adapalene is often recommended. It's less irritating. The formulation is usually more moisturising. And 0.1% is apparently as effective as tret 0.025%.\n\nHAVING SAID ALL THAT, you really have to experiment to find the best combo for you, I'm afraid. Again, it depends on your skin's sensitivity, your exisiting skin routine, your access to what's available. Don't just go for the trend or people's anecdote, your skin is different. Also, formulation makes a massive difference. People's experiences vary. Some prefer a moisturising, cream formulation. Some prefer a gel. I have done both and have gone through A LOT of different forumation and strength and even though my skin liked 0.1% tretinoin gel a couple of years back, now I stick with the Boderm tazarotene. I'm pretty sure that the Boderm formulation makes the tazarotene tolerable and less irritating, though this is purely my experience and at this point I'm using it for skin overall texture rather than acne.\n\nSo, I'd recommend adapalene or tret for a beginner any day over tazarotene, unless you cannot get to adapalene or tret. If your major concern is acne or hyperpigmentation, go for adapalene or tret (which are backed up by more clinical studies.)",

So only advanced users go for it, As even I faced a mild tingling sensation when I apply it on damp face in a hurry.\n\nSo the bottle comes initially in a cap and a separate dropper. Due to the packaging, Gas is generated which makes a sound every time you open the bottle.\n\nIt left a slight stain on the packaging & your clothes too. A good time to reiterate that the product is yellow in colour, that made me believe it has oxidized, following which I contacted their team, wherein they assured that their product doesn't get oxidized but has to be used within 2 months of opening. This has been stated on Beautybarn site too.\n\nTalking on performance, the glow was there. I also saw my acne marks fade a little, no major improvement, but a difference was there. \n\nTowards the end, I couldn't help thinking the stains on bottle were more, and it felt sticky on application. Like if you applied on neck and then touched it, you could feel the stickiness. I also noticed less difference on my skin, making me wonder if it's normal or does the product work only within the first month.\n\nI genuinely think this Serum has scope if they work on their formulation, do something about the stickiness and the stains. Oh! And the price too.\n\n👍**WRP:** WRP, if They make some minor changes to their formulation and if it's on discount.",

I agree with this review OP it is helping with acne marks a bit, it is sticky. I haven't noticed any staining but I wouldn't know. \n\nBut I'd like to mention it smells so bad right when you first open the bottle. It goes away in few seconds and you can't smell anything when you apply it. I was worried about this and the colour so I DMed beautybarn and well and they said its okay to use. \n\nEven after this I was worried but I saw a video on youtube by James Welsh. I don't care about a review from someone with already great skin but it reassured me that the smell and colour are normal. He said it smells like hot dog water. I don't know what that's like cause I'm vegetarian but it sounds unpleasant. But I don't even notice the smell on this anymore. \n\nAlso it didn't sting on damp skin for me.  And this is my first time using vitamin c after 8-9 years even then I didnt use it regularly before. So I'm a beginner. It did sting on active acne and when applied it on a tiny scratch on my face I didn't even know I had until it stung.\n\nWould I buy it full price? No but I'd buy it if it was on sale at a price less than 1500.\n\nAlso how will I know if it has oxidised if it is already yellow?",

In this reaction, the sulfite ion is oxidised as follows:**\n\n**SO3**^(2-) **(aq) + H2O(l)** \\-> **SO4**^(2-) **(aq) + 2H**^(+) **+ 2e**^(-)\n\nWhat is the new oxidation number of the metal in the salt if its original oxidation number was +3?\n\nThe trick is to first ignore if the metal gets oxidised or reduced.First decide how many moles of electrons gain/lose for each metallic ion.\n\nAmount of sulfite ions = 0.1/1000 x 25 = 0.0025 mol\n\nAmount of metallic salt = 0.1/1000 x 50 = 0.0050 mol\n\nFind the total number of electrons transferred = 0.0025 mol x 2 = 0.005 mol\n\nFind the total number of electrons gain/lose for each metallic ion = 0.005/0.005  = 1\n\nThen decide if the metal gets oxidised or reduced.\n\nSince sulfite was oxidised, the metallic ion gets reduced (by 1).\n\nAs the original oxidation number of the metal was +3, the new oxidation number is now +2.\n\nAs an analogy, consider there are 25 boys in the class.\n\nEach boy will pass $2 to the girls in the class for a total of $50 dollars.\n\nIf there are 50 girls in the class, each girl will receive $1.\n\nSince each girl has $2 from the start, they will now have $3 each.",

    "body": "I recently got some New55, an instant positive/negative film that's a reinvention of Polaroid Type 55. Here are some notes on how the first few sheets went.\n\n**Differences**\n\nNew55 isn't a copy of the Polaroid material, it's re-engineered. As such, there are several differences. \n\nOld Type 55 required the negatives to be soaked in sodium sulfite to neutralize remaining chemistry, and the prints had to be protected with a sticky, vinegary smelling coater. In addition, you had to choose an exposure that would yield either a good negative (overexposing the print) or a good print (underexposing the negative). \n\nNew55 requires the negatives to be fixed and washed like conventional film, and they recommend that the print be coated with clear lacquer. It's supposed to be possible to get a good negative and a good print with the same exposure.\n\n**The process**\n\nNew55 is 4x5 sheet film, and requires a Polaroid 545 or 545i back and a 4x5 large format camera.\n\nThe New55 envelope is inserted into the back which is set to L (Load). There's a clip at the bottom of the envelope that locks it into the back. The back is inserted into the camera, the cover sheet is pulled up, the exposure is made, and the cover sheet is pushed back down. At this point you can develop the film, or remove it from the back for later processing (there's a button on the back to release the clip so you can pull the undeveloped sheet out).\n\nTo develop, the lever on the back is set to P (Process) and the envelope is pulled out of the back slowly and steadily. The envelope moves through the processing rollers, which bursts a pod containing the processing reagent and spreads it in between the print/negative sandwich. Processing time is 4 minutes. At the end, the sandwich is removed from the envelope and peeled apart. The negative goes in the fixer and the print is set aside to dry.\n\nExcess reagent for every sheet I processed spilled out the end of the pack - probably a bit too much in the pod. This required a teardown of the 545 back to clean out the gunk.\n\nThe negative is fixed in 50% Ilford Rapid Fixer. A lot of reagent goo ends up in the fixer, so it should be run through a coffee filter on the way back to the stock bottle.\n\n**First results**\n\nMy [first test](https://www.flickr.com/photos/xnedski/20596702153) was outside in the evening as the light was beginning to fade.  I added some extra exposure because the film is conventional grain and I assumed it would start having reciprocity issues at exposure times > 1s. This  turned out to be completely unnecessary. The print was overexposed and the negative is a bit dense.\n\nThe second test was in a studio environment with a flash. The [print is lovely](https://www.flickr.com/photos/xnedski/20636001364), and the [negative is very nice](https://www.flickr.com/photos/xnedski/21273518285) as well, with incredible detail. There is something like solarization going on in the deepest shadows (under the chin and in the hair).\n\nNew55 is a work in progress. Compare the above to a Polaroid Type 55 [positive](https://www.flickr.com/photos/xnedski/3154380970) and [negative](https://www.flickr.com/photos/xnedski/9387146205) I shot in the 80s and you see they still have a way to go. It's too expensive for regular use -- the current high price is to continue funding the production ramp-up. Still, I'm enjoying it. \n\nLearn more at [new55.net](http://www.new55.net/).",

Previously hoarding my last four packs of type 55 till I know I'll never need them or something really special comes along. \n\nDo you think the solarization is happening because of exposure post development. As in when you transfer the neg to the fixer but before its totally fixed. I wonder if doing this in a darkroom wouldn't be the best way to avoid that. Unfortunately, this negates one of the advantages of type 55 which was development pretty much anywhere ( I have a locking Tupperware tub for my sodium sulfite that goes in my bag). But there's always going to be some tradeoffs. I'm just happy I might be able to go out and shoot LF again without access to a true darkroom.",

    "body": "Hi People,\n\nI see a lot of references to dairy and gluten here but almost nothing in regards to sulfites, salts and food preservatives and their effects on sinuses. Let me tell you about my journey with regards to sinusitis. I've been fighting it for about five years now, since my late 40s or early 50s.\n\nIn my case I realized one of the major factors which would influence the onset of an attack was what I was eating. Yes eliminating dairy and gluten is good if that works for you. I found that when I went gluten free my GI tract was just functionally much improved, initially my sinuses benefitted too.  I initially thought I had a gluten intolerance. Tests for allergies and for gluten turned up negative (actually inconclusive in gluten's case). So, I started eliminating things from my diet. Interestingly, I could eat a fresh baguette with no harm to my sinuses, but a factory loaf designed to stay soft or inhibit mold (read: most supermarket breads contain calcium or sodium propionate) would make me sick. It often took a few hours but eventually I was get stuffed up. There seemed to be a slow, medium and faster attack on my sinuses depending on what I was exposed to. Sometimes I would think it was cumulative.\n\nThere were other known triggers that would quickly inflame my sinuses: wines with high sulfite concentrations were an early culprit. Wine and grapes contain natural sulfites but many factory wines contain \"additional\" sulfites to give the wine a longer shelf life. I was used to drinking wine in Europe, where, if a bottle was opened it was finish that night. There was never a half-bottle left in the fridge for week. Wines that are drinkable after two days never mind a week are probably spiked with additional sulfites to stay \"fresh\" for the consumer's benefit, not always but often.\n\nBeers makers also may add sulfites to keep the product fresh or add them inadvertently. Some beer makers will at some point kill the yeasts in the primary fermentation step using sulfites thus introducing them into the food chain. Sometimes they use Sodium Metabisulphite or Potassium Metabisulphite as equipment sterilizers. I drink whisky now. To be exact, lightly oaked Bourbon. Yum.\n\nAnother culprit was concentrated lemon and lime juices used in cooking. These ones are both loaded with sulfites. Concentrated lemon juice in particular is also included in many prepared foods as a preservative for this reason. Fresh lemon juice seemed to be alright for me to consume.\n\nMeats and sausages. This is a hard category for me as I do enjoy eating in this category. However, any meat that has been \"cured\" or \"seasoned\" so that it stays pink and doesn't go moldy over the long term is a big no-no for me. Most bacons  are also a problem as they are often brined and cured with high sodium solutions and sometimes pink curing powders, in bacon's case it likely contains sodium nitrite. \"Insta Cure\" or Prague Powders #1 and #2 (Number 1 and Number 2) are used extensively in the meat trade to preserve sausage products like sandwich meats and sausages like kolbassa (kielbassa) smokies etc.. Sodium sulfite and sodium nitrite are the active chemicals. I'm fine eating fresh meat like steak, pork and chicken.  Note: some meats will be listed on restaurant menus as \"seasoned\" this is the big red flag that they have been treated with tenderizers at the factory and then often frozen and boxed for transport for the restaurant trade. No one wants a tough piece of meat so they have just normalized chemically pre-tenderizing meats.\n\nMany sea foods are packed in either high sodium solutions or sulfited solutions to prevent browning and spoilage. Muscles, oysters, shrimp all could trigger a sinusitus event when I ate them. Salmon is interesting in that it also give my nose grief but it's because salmon is naturally high in sulfites. Probably why it stays pink for a long time on it's own.\n\nPrepared supermarket sauces like salad dressings, ketchups, bbq sauces, basically anything in a can or jar are all out for me. Anything that can sit on a shelf for months or years is out. Same with canned veggies and dried fruit. Dried fruit is like or can be a concentrated sulfite bomb.\n\nMany liquids like sodas, drinks, juices, drink mixes may contain things like sodium benzoate, calcium propionate and calcium choride.\n\nNasal sprays and medication I'm also very careful about. A lot of medications need to be stored for weeks or months before being used. Check the \"non-medical\" ingredients and or MSDS documents for things you didn't know you were putting in or near your body. Hopefully your nasal spray isn't making your condition worse because you're inadvertently spraying something that inflames your tissues.\n\nSounds pretty grim doesn't it? What can I eat? and not get sick is a terrible question to have to ask yourself all the time. Most of the chemicals I've mentioned are considered \"generally accepted as safe\" for use as food preservatives. Generally that is. In my case it's been a lot or trial and error, mostly error.\n\nThe good news. The good news is that the way past this is to \"eat fresh\". It worked for me. Changing my diet to fresh or frozen veggies, fresh fruit, potatoes or rice as a starch and fresh meats is actually a wonderful way to eat. Do I miss eating junk food. Oh yeah, but the price I pay for going off my diet is not being able to breath or smell for 1 to 7 days depending on how severe the attack is. I get lazy sometimes like a patient going off their meds because they feel fine, then ending up hitting bottom because I'd convinced myself that all was well. I wish there was a pill I could take to make it all go away or back to the way it was but there isn't, it's a lifestyle change that I had to make. I've moved on.\n\nI hope this helps just one other person who finds themselves in the same boat then it'll be worth the half day I spent writing this. Please feel free to add your experiences to this thread.\n\n\\~m",

So I'm typing this up that way if you come across these chemicals you will know what to do in case of emergency.\n\n\nAlways wear appropriate PPE (gloves goggles respirator), all it takes is for a tiny drop of something to fly out and hit your eye for you to end up blind.\n\nIf any chemical liquid, powder, granular, or tablet contacts you or your clothing immediately remove the affected clothing, wash the area thoroughly, and contact your local poison control center or physician for further advice. If the chemical spills clean up according to your local laws/regulations and follow appropriate safety precautions as outlined in the manufactures SDS which your facility is required to keep on file. \n\nThe most common chemicals you will come across at a pool fall into roughly 2  categories: water balancers,  and disinfectants.\n\nWater balancers are things that change the water chemistry like raising or lowering the PH, changing the total dissolved solids or changing the calcium hardness, and much more. The most common ones are: sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium sesquicarbonate, muriatic acid, sodium bisulfate, Cyanuric acid(), calcium chloride, sodium thiosulfate, sodium sulfite.\n\nDisinfectants are chemicals that disinfect with chlorine or bromine. The most common of which are: sodium hypochlorite(liquid), calcium hypochlorite(granular/tabs/briquettes), Lithium hypochlorite(granular), chlorine gas(gas), trichlor(granular/tabs), dichlor(granular), and BCDMH(bromine)(granular/tabs), ozone(gas).\n\nEvery single one of these chemicals has the potential to cause serious bodily harm or death both to you and others if mishandled, DO NOT USE THEM UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO DO SO OR ARE ACTING UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF SOMEONE WHO IS TRAINED TO DO SO.",

    "body": "Hello, everyone. I'm doing research on anoxia tolerance in a developmental lab, and I'm trying to find a way to efficiently generate anoxic water in a way that is amenable to drug screens or microscopy. Previously, we've been using nitrogen gas to displace the oxygen in an anoxia chamber, but this method isn't ideal for what we're trying to do. We're thus considering oxygen-scavenging chemicals instead, but we're running into problems. The easiest one, sodium sulfite, causes an unacceptable increase in pH that will kill our embryos, and it reacts with acids to make sulfur dioxide, which will also kill our embryos, so it doesn't look like it will work. Other inorganic scavengers either work at acidic pHs or are toxic, so they're not viable options either. There appears to be some organic scavengers that may work, but I'm finding it difficult to find out their effects on pH or toxicity, since most resources regarding these chemicals are for industrial boilers and water purification, not research. I'm particularly interested in DEHA, \"gloxy\", and pyranose oxidase and catalase. If anyone has used these in a research context, I'd love to hear your input.\n\nHas anyone here used oxygen scavengers in their work? What ones did you use? How did you get around some of the problems we're having?",

I have started following a skincare routine 11 days ago. It was a joyous Thursday for my face that, over the course of past 30 years, has been exposed to the winds, low temperatures, a late onslaught of chicken pox, persistent hormonal acne, and results of a poor diet. I also happen to have PCOS, which makes the challenge to have clear skin extra challenging.\n\nThis is our starting point. After reading through [the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index) on r/SkincareAddiction, I had come up with the following routine to improve the condition of my skin:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# ROUTINE\n\n**MORNING**\n\n* Cleanser \\(Step I\\): **Bioderma Sensibio H2O micellar water** \\(applied with a cotton pad\\)\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, PEG\\-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Propylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus \\(Cucumber\\) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Bromide.\n* *Moisturiser \\(Step I\\):* **Lumene Hydration Recovery Oxygenation** **gel** **mask**\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, Propanediol, Betula Alba \\(Birch\\) Juice, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth\\-20, Phenoxyethanol, Rubus Chamaemorus \\(Cloudberry\\) Seed Extract, Acrylates/c10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Peg\\-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Trehalose, Urea, Eriophorum Spissum Flower/Stem Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium Edta, Copper Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Pentylene Glycol, Serine, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Algin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Pullulan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha\\-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Citronellol, Parfum \\(Fragrance\\), \\(Ci 42090\\) Blue 1, \\(Ci 60730\\) Ext.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

        "body": "Maskholic here, checking in. \n\nI usually do a mask everyday, it’s my favorite part of my routine. My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

If it turns black, you have neutralized OsO4.\n\nI know, right?? Corn oil, of all things. In fact, if you spill a full vial of OsO4 solution, you have to dowse it with kitty litter soaked in corn oil. WEIRD!!!

Every other ingredient is there to either protect CD-4, adjust the pH, or otherwise help CD-4 do its job.\n\nA tyipical C-41 developer looks like this:\n\n* **Part A:** Potassium carbonate, usually with DTPA, sodium-something-sulfite, something-bromide.\n* **Part B:** Hydroxylamine sulfate --- protects CD-4 from oxygen but doesn't play well with Part A.\n* **Part C:** CD-4, usually with sodium-something-sulfite.\n\nSo why is it that Flic Film's developer doesn't have CD-4:\n\n* **Part A:** Potassium carbonate, Sodium sulfite, Potassium bromide.\n* **Part B:** Hydroxylamine sulfate, p-Phenylenediamine.\n\nThere is no CD-4. I see p-Phenylenediamine and that is a precursor to CD-4, but it is a **much** simpler molecule and I really don't think you can just use that just use that instead of CD-4. Things like CD-3 are **way** closer to CD-4 and if you switch them, you're no longer doing C-41, you're cross processing.\n\nCan anyone make sense of this?

No nitric acid but the hydrogen peroxide and hcl I brought I know can put au into solution. But this is above my pay grade. I have an idea to get the gold out the ore. To put it in the furnace and melt the gold out, however the furnace is badly corroded due to the 55 gallon drum of acid so I do not want to use it because I do not trust the integrity of it. Inside the unit, he had broken crucibles, which told me that inside of the furnace there was spilled material, so I removed manually the slag that was at the bottom of the furnace. I found what would be copper and gold but they’re together I can learn everything about getting the gold out of The ore later. this post is how to separate the gold from the copper without melting it, using the assets that I mentioned above if possible. I was thinking about just getting a propane torch and melting it down agin but I’m not sure if that would just mix it more. I don’t like making rose gold jewelry but I would like to control how much Gold is in it. So can someone one please help me separate gold from copper I think a good idea of what I’m looking at is the last picture I have. ",

I have done some testing so far with a rapid developer consisting of hydroxylamine sulfate, sodium sulfite, and sodium hydroxide. \n\nA silver diffusion transfer monobath for instant films is also possible with some modification, as well as many other things. \n\nAnother thing of possible intrigue is a fast monobath for black and white papers, so one can easily make prints. An advantage to a monobath for paper is that most darkroom printers use only one or two different brands of paper, which means that the problem of monobaths not working for many different types of emulsions is less problematic, as emulsions by the same manufacturer will be similar. \n\nI am wondering if there is any interest in these things so that I might do some more testing and maybe post some results, and maybe some formulas. I hope that more people will be interested in this fascinating combined developing-fixing solution. \n\nI can post some early results of my color monobath when I get them scanned.

    "body": "I'm looking for some chemistry-based insight on disulfide bond formation. My training is primarily in biology and I'm at the mercy of google for new ideas to solve my problem. Based on what I understand, I've hit a wall as to why I'm having this issue.  Here it is:\n\nI'm expressing a protein that contains 12 cysteines, all of which form disulfide bonds. 4/6 are within a short 36-amino acid peptide sequence, and 2 are within antibody fragments. This protein loves to form huge disulfide-bonded aggregates when expressed, and must be treated with denaturant + reducing agent to be solubilized. Initially I was using urea + DTT, but once the DTT is removed during purifcation, aggregates immediately form again. This led me to go with urea in combination with S-sulfonation, which significantly increased my progress in the lab. I now use guanidine in place of urea to avoid unwanted protein modification.\n\nAnyhoo, S-sulfonating the protein allows the cysteines to be modified in such a way (with a sulfite group, I believe) that they cannot form disulfide bonds until further reduced. With this, I can wash off the s-sulfonating reagents and purify the protein very nicely in denaturing conditions. \n\nI then refold and reform the disulfide bonds in the protein. After quite a bit of optimization, I've learned that reducing the protein with 1mM DTT for 15 minutes at room temp followed by diluting it into refolding buffer with arginine and oxidized glutathione at pH 10.3 works best for refolding and reforming disulfide bonds (strictly as indicated by faster migration on a non-reducing gel). \n\nHere's the issue: no matter what I do, the best I can get is 50% refolded. The other 50% of the protein fraction migrates at the same rate as completely reduced protein. What's especially mysterious to me is that I might expect 50% not refolded, and the rest a smattering of protein sizes - some with 1-6 disulfide bonds formed - resulting in a smear below the reduced fraction. However, I get two nice bands - one that appears completely refolded, and one that appears completely reduced.\n\nWhat can I possibly be missing? Thinking that perhaps that 50% is actually completely reduced, I reacted it overnight with thiol-reactive low molecular weight PEG - which should increase the protein size if the cysteines are reduced and react with the PEG compounds. This was effective for my positive control (protein treated with DTT prior to addition of thiol-reactive PEG), but I didn't see a significant change in my two-isoform protein fraction not pretreated with DTT.\n\nWhat could be up with the cysteines in the non-refolded fraction? Is there is a different modification that would prevent them from being reduced and capable of forming disulfides? I've tried using more DTT for pre-reduction, thinking more was needed to remove the sulfite groups, but this actually results in a lower refolded fraction.  I've tried many other things and am happy to elaborate if needed. I think this post is already long enough!\n\nThank you in advance for your help. I truly appreciate any suggestions.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I'm S-sulfonating with 200mM sodium sulifte + 150mM sodium tetrathionate.\n\nEdit 2: For clarification, I only employ one reduction step with DTT. My current procedure is \n\n* Solubilize protein in 6M guanidine, 200mM sodium sulfite, 150mM sodium tetrathionate, 50mM tris pH 7, 150mM NaCl\n* Purify protein via nickel column (protein is His-tagged) in denaturing conditions (same buffer as above without sulfite/tetrathionate). Protein is eluted with imidazole.\n* Reduce with 1mM DTT for 15 minutes\n* Dilute reduced protein 1:100 into stirring refolding buffer containing 0.5M arginine and 2mM oxidized glutathione at pH 10.3.",

Are you sure what you get out after sulfontation and purification is actually only one thing and not a mixture? \n\nIf you had only partial sulfonation, then you maybe could get weird disulfide links which wouldn’t normally form and twist the protein into such a weird shape that it isn’t coming back.\n\nDo you have free alcohol groups (serine) in the protein? I could see those reacting with the tetrathionate. \n\nIf we establish that you do only make one thing when you reduce your protein then we are left with the second reduction and trying to figure out why that might not happen. \n\nAre you using exact stoichiometries or an excess of DTT for the second reduction? If the reaction isn’t proceeding via the expected mechanism and you’re using what you think is an exact stoichiometry you might run into issues.\n\nAre there any stronger reducing agents you could try for this step? And perhaps a different sulfonating reagent if it is causing other modifications.\n\nHow close together are your sulfur atoms in the protein?",

Although quite a lot of recipes of ultrafine-grained developers have been developed at the moment, this recipe is unique in many respects.  For example, it uses CD-1, a developing substance, which is usually used in color photography.  The combination of CD-1 with glycine gives a REALLY small grain, does not emit colloidal silver, and also does not reduce the sensitivity of the film\n\n\n\n The negatives obtained during processing in this developer look somewhat unusual - the density (especially the maximum) can be low, and they seem to be underdeveloped.  Extremely \"clean\" low densities and unexposed areas - the developer gives VERY little veiling.  But in the shadows there are all the details, and almost without requiring a contrast increase when printing, the prints really turn out to be of excellent “juiciness”.  Negatives can have a noticeable brownish color, due to the high fineness of the silver that creates the image.  As plots for this developer, filming of contrasting plots in the direct Sun with exposure metering in mid tones or shadows is best suited.\n\n The recipe was published in the journal \"Soviet PHOTO\" No. 12/1988 p. 44 (without soda)\n\n CD-1 ................................... 3 g.\n\n Glycine .................................. 2 g.\n\n Sodium sulfite b / c .............. 45 g.\n\n Sodium carbonate ................ 1.8 g.\n\n Potassium bromide ................. 0.5 g.\n\n Water, up to ............................... 1l.\n\n Since an alkaline medium is required for the normal operation of the developer, and the sodium sulfite used by us practically does not contain soda as an impurity (unlike sodium sulfite, the “photo” brand produced in the USSR), soda was added to the recipe.  Practice has shown that with such a recipe the developer’s performance was just excellent!\n\n The film should be processed in this developer 1.5 times longer during CONTINUOUS agitation!\n\n You must work with this developer very carefully, CPV-1 is REALLY POISONOUS, try not to get onto your hands",

As plots for this developer, filming of contrasting plots in the direct Sun with exposure metering in mid tones or shadows is best suited.\n\n The recipe was published in the journal \"Soviet PHOTO\" No. 12/1988 p. 44 (without soda)\n\n CD-1 ................................... 3 g.\n\n Glycine .................................. 2 g.\n\n Sodium sulfite b / c .............. 45 g.\n\n Sodium carbonate ................ 1.8 g.\n\n Potassium bromide ................. 0.5 g.\n\n Water, up to ............................... 1l.\n\n Since an alkaline medium is required for the normal operation of the developer, and the sodium sulfite used by us practically does not contain soda as an impurity (unlike sodium sulfite, the “photo” brand produced in the USSR), soda was added to the recipe.  Practice has shown that with such a recipe the developer’s performance was just excellent!\n\n The film should be processed in this developer 1.5 times longer during CONTINUOUS agitation!\n\n You must work with this developer very carefully, CPV-1 is REALLY POISONOUS, try not to get into your hands",

Any suggestions where that could’ve gone wrong?\n\n\nFirst I developed normally for 6 min at 20°C in 1+25 Rodinal. This was followed by acidic washing and water washing. \nThen I bleached using chromosulfuric acid for 3 minutes, washed using sodium sulfite solution, washed with water and then washed using dilute sodium hydroxide to correct the pH. \nAfter that I exposed to light for half a minute directly under a strong lamp. \nRespooled the film and developed as before in Rodinal, fixed for 4 minutes and washed using water and last wash with distilled water and surfactant. \n\n\nWhat’s the most likely place where this fog could’ve occurred?\n",

I use metabisulphate to clear and that takes about 2 minutes. Both these processes go to competition so longer (to a point) is safer. Then for fogging, you said “a strong lamp” but what’s the light? Are you using a tungsten bulb? And for how long? If you see the image start to form under the light you’ll print out the film and create some base fog. \n\nAlso, I’ve never had to “correct pH” with hydroxide. Film doesn’t hold much solution and washing with several changes of water between each step should be sufficient. \n\nHope this helps, and best of luck!",

Although this is not critical to my function in lab, I'd still ~~like~~ really like to know why it's used. \n\n\"50.1 g Na2SO3 (anh.) (400 mmol) was dissolved in 250 mL H2O. (4-Acetylaminophenyl)sulfonyl chloride (47.7 g, 204 mmol) was added slowly to the solution. The pH of the solution was maintained above 9 using 50% NaOH. After 2 hours, 60% H2SO4 was added dropwise until a white precipitate formed. The white precipitate (4-Acetylaminophenyl)sulfonic acid) was collected by vacuum filtration. The yield was 48.0 (97%). Pure by NMR, FTIR, and MS.\"\n\nAs far as I understand, chloride should leave the sulfone sulfur via an SN2 mechanism with nucleophilic hydroxide. Perhaps the sulfite serves to stabilize the reaction mixture, or form an adduct with the amide ketone? I doubt either of those answers are correct though - the amide should be quite stable in this chemical environment. I feel like I'm missing something obvious here and it's bugging me.

Potassium ferricyanide - K*_3_*[Fe(CN)*_6_*]\n9. Potassium ferrocyanide - K*_4_*[Fe(CN)*_6_*]\n10. Sodium hydroxide - NaOH\n11. Sodium sulfate - Na*_2_*SO*_4_*\n12. Sodium sulfite - Na*_2_*SO*_3_*\n\nI'm not sure about the concentration of some of the more corrosive chemicals because I'm not at the school, but seeing as it's a beginner set, I don't think they would be too dangerous.\n\nI would also like to confirm some of the conventions with the written formulas. \n\nWhy is potassium written outside the square brackets?

Similarly the ferricyanide ion is Fe(CN)6^3-\n\n> why is CN written in parenthesis?\n\nThat is the cyanide ligand.  Yes, cyanide.  But it is much less dangerous complexed up in ferrocyanide and ferricyanide than it would be in, say, potassium cyanide, KCN.\n\nModern nomenclature has ferricyanide as hexacyanoferrate (III) and freeocyanide as hexacyanoferrate (II) because the iron is in oxidation states III and II respectively.\n\nWith a couple of those chemicals you can make the pigment, prussian blue, which has been known from antiquity and which you can probably look up on Wiki.\n\nA solution of calcium hydroxide is called lime water.  It gives a white precipitate of calcium carbonate when it absorbs carbon dioxide.  A precipitate that later redissolves with more carbon dioxide to form soluble calcium bicarbonate.  A process that demonstrates the formation of limestone caves, staligtites and staligmites.\n\nYou need some level-approprate texts.  Good luck.",

It barely held on and bit and pieces came out as I poured off the fixer. I only got one image off of it and other spots could be smeared with the finger alone. It was a slurry.\n\nMy only issue was that I may have improperly diluted my ilford rapid fixer. It may have been too concentrated. I mixed the bottle a while ago and forgot exactly what dilution I had reduced it to. It may have been closer to 1:3 rather than the recommended 1:4.\n\nWhat went wrong?",

    "body": "Hi guys.\n\nSorry for another post about DIY developers, but I've been thinking: A downside of these Phenidone + Vitamin C + Sodium Sulfite developers is that they all tend to have a short shelf life (not sure how long). They are susceptible to a \"sudden death\" where they just stop working without warning.\n\nThe sudden death is caused by the Fenton reaction, which is when iron dissolved in the water reacts with hydrogen peroxide in the water to produce -OH radicals that destroy organic compounds (e.g. Vitamin C).\n\nThis leads me to some ideas to prolong the life of these developers:\n\n(1) The one everyone knows:  Store it in a glass bottle, filled to the top, and a tight lid to minimize exposure to oxygen.\n\n(2) **Use distilled water:** Minimize the presence of iron ions in the first place.\n\n(3) **Store the bottle in the refrigerator?** ... Refrigerators slow chemical reactions.\n\n(3) **Add DTPA:** [This person in Photrio](https://www.photrio.com/forum/threads/will-the-real-mytol-please-stand-up.84293/#post-2764510) suggested this solution. DTPA is chelating agent (reacts with iron) and is part of the original XTOL recipe. You can buy DTPA-Na5 from ArtCraft and some users in that thread discuss that option.\n\n(4) **Set aside the Vitamin C and only add it right before use:** [This person](https://www.photrio.com/forum/threads/will-the-real-mytol-please-stand-up.84293/page-4#post-2765623) suggested that idea.\n\nI'm going to try some of these ideas and see what happens. Let me know if you sue E-72 or Instant MyTol and have done anything interesting to prolong the life of either the stock or the working solutions. I'd love to find out what you've tried and whether it worked.",

Seriously that dermatologist is so out of touch with what is safe, I'm shook.\n\nCleanser - Should be fine, sulfate as a surfactant is a bit dated because it can be irritating and drying, but overall mostly fine.\n\nToner - Toners aren't totally necessary in a routine, salicylic and allantoin are helpful, but are also found elsewhere in your routine. Take it or leave it, can be irritating with the Alcohol.\n\nMoisturizer - There are 4 parabens and sulfate in this. I would switch, that's insane. There's no need for either of those things in a moisturizer.\n\nAcne Gel - Is this like a spot treatment leave-on? There are 3 parabens and alcohol in it which don't really help you at all... For a leave-on spot treatment, look at CeraVe Acne Control Gel. \n\nWhitening Cream - .. im confused what this would be for? Hyperpigmentation maybe? Anyway, much better options. 4 parabens, paraffin, AND sulfate... absurd.\n\nSunscreen - fine, could be better could be worse! I suggest looking into korean sunscreen. I really like Beauty of Joseon and Derma:B, both can be purchased from sites like Yesstyle and StyleVana. Light years ahead of US sunscreens.\n\nScar Gel - This one is actually good to go! Several things in there to promote wound healing and anti-aging. Not sure how effective those are at diminishing scars, but could help.\n\nP.M Cleanser Toner Moisturizer Acne Gel Mixed Fruits Acid Cream: So is this like a 5 in 1 product?? Cleanser, Toner, Moisturizer, Acne Gel, Acid Cream all in one? Whatever it is, get rid of it lol. 4 parabens, paraffin, and sulfates.\n\n  \n... are these all one brand? The ingredients chosen seem that way.. Parabens are preservatives basically, and they can and often do affect your hormonal balance in the body and increase your risk of cancer, and some parabens in particular have been suggested that they actually speed up aging skin.. Sounds like this dermatologist wants to make sure they have repeat business..",

Can someone check it please?\n\n**Epoxidation with H2O2/NaOH:**\n\nWeigh (R) -carvone (4.8 mmol) in a 25 mL round bottom flask, add 8 mL of methanol and cool to 0 ° C. Then 1.5 mL of 35% H2O2 solution (density = 1.11 g / mL) is added (Warning: corrosive solution, wear gloves) then 1 mL of 6M NaOH drop by drop over 1-2 min. The mixture is stirred for 10 min at 0 ° C. and 20 min at room temperature. Then 10 mL of CH2Cl2 is added and transferred to a separatory funnel.

    "body": "I saw Luna Nectar's [Nocturne spray](https://lunanectar.com/products/nocturne-magnesium-sleep-oil), and got inspired to make a magnesium oil spray myself based on the ingredients listed there.\n\nFrom what I can tell, what they used is:\n\n* Distilled Water\n* Magnesium Chloride\n* Aloe Vera Leaf Juice\n* Lavender Essential Oil\n* Sweet Orange Essential Oil\n\nThis list of ingredients is a little confusing to me.\n\nAccording to the [chelating agent guide post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/bj6lh2/when_to_use_a_chelating_agent_in_your_diy_formula), this mixture contains Aloe Vera Leaf Juice and should have a chelating agent. Since this is a commercial product, I'm confused on how it's having a long shelf life when metal ions were actually expressly added to the mixture.\n\nThis mixture also doesn't contain an emulsifier. Aloe Vera Leaf Juice can, from my research, act as a weak emulsifier, but it seems like you need a lot of it.\n\nI also saw that standard concentration of essential oils is around 2.5%. Does this still hold if there's more than one essential oil in the mixture, or should it be 2.5% split between the two? \n\nTo keep everything natural, I was thinking about something along these lines:\n\n* Distilled Water, 65%\n* Magnesium Chloride (powder, dissolved into the water), 15g/mL of final product\n* Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, 30% (i am not sure if this is enough to make an emulsion)\n* Lavender Essential Oil, 2.5%\n* Sweet Orange Essential Oil, 2.5%\n\nI listed my percentages as percent-by-volume, I don't know if that's standard practice or if it makes a difference but I don't know the density of all the stuff I'd be using. I presume it's similar to 1g/mL, just like water, but this recipe also uses a powdered ingredient, so mass percentage would definitely be different. \n\nI was also thinking about adding around 0.2% Fulvic Acid to serve as the chelating agent, but I don't actually know where to source it from.\n\nThoughts on the formula? Is there anything I should change/anything I'm doing wrong?\n\nEDIT: Found from [somewhere else](https://www.thedetoxmarket.com/products/luna-nectar-nocturne-magnesium-sleep-oil) this list of ingredients: Aqua, Magnesium Chloride, Aloe Barbendensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Lavendula Officinalis (Lavender) Essential Oil, Citrus Sinensis (Sweet Orange) Essential Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Sulfite, Limonene, Linalool\n\nso the extra ingredients are: \n- Citric Acid (pH adjuster, weak chelating agent)\n- sodium benzoate (preservative)\n- potassium sorbate (preservative)\n- sodium sulfite (preservative)\n- limonene (seems like this could be for scent?)\n- linalool (seems also for scent)\n\nI still don't see a strong emulsifier here, so I'm not really sure what's going on... The preservatives probably mitigate the aloe problem I mentioned earlier though\n\nAlso, I meant 0.15g/mL (or 15g/(100mL) for the anhydrous magnesium chloride concentration.\n\nEDIT 2: I went and found all the ingredients I would use for this and the price for everything is like $93??? it's so expensive lmao (though, to be fair, that's because nobody sells ingredients in small enough quantities for just one product like this) \n\nI don't own a scale or anything either so I figured that into it, that might not be fair. \n\nIf I were to use the projected amount of each ingredient in the mixture, Luna Nectar seems to be making these at around $1.60 per bottle (not including the price of the bottle), which is.... well, a lot less than $40. To be specific, it's around a 2,425% profit margin.",

I don’t think one time application is enough for a real “build up” problem. Personally I stay away from silicones too, they bring a fake nourishment and shine that can lead to dried out hair on the long run, obviously I prefer a natural real shine that comes from really hydrated hair! but honestly sulfates and other drying ingredients like alcohol is what I avoid the most. I think if you’ll continue to provide your hair with the nourishment they need you’ll be ok. A treatment for aesthetic purposes can help sometimes.\nI’m curious to know the name of the brand you used last year if you don’t mind sharing (I have some white hair to cover and need a little oomph right now!) ;)",

Yesterday I asked a question about PC-TEA and one of the discussions led to u/B_Huij sharing his recipe for Instant MyTol. Here it is, adjusted to the 300mL that I use for my tank:\n\n    Water              150 mL\n    Sodium Sulfite       9 g\n    Ascorbic Acid    1.725 g\n    Washing Soda       840 mg\n    Borax              210 mg\n    Phenidone         22.5 mg\n\nThen you can mix this 1+1 with water and follow the development instructions for XTol 1+1.\n\n**My Idea:**  I think you could make a two-part 1+5 concentrated developer. Put the ingredients that dissolve well in water in a water solution and Phenidone in a Propylene Glycol solution.\n\n    Part A:  20 rolls\n    \n          Distilled Water      1 L\n          Sodium Sulfite     180 g    (  18% solution)\n          Ascorbic Acid     34.5 g    (3.45% solution)\n          Washing Soda      16.8 g    (1.68% solution)\n          Borax              4.2 g    (0.42% solution)\n    \n    Part B:  20 rolls\n    \n          Propylene Glycol   200 mL\n          Phenidone          0.9 g    (0.45% solution)\n\n  \nTo mix the working solution:\n\n    50mL Part A\n     5mL Part B\n    Water to make 300mL\n\nThen follow instructions for XTol 1+1 dilution.\n\nFrom what I've read, **Part B** should last for many years. I have no idea whether **Part A** keeps well or not. If you have any idea whether Part A would keep well, do let me know.\n\nAnyway, what do you think? It's not as super-concentrated as PC-TEA or Rodinal, but it's something.",

Or if you want something you can do at home, I recommend using a color-depositing shampoo, conditioner, or hair mask that you can apply directly to the hair without mixing two ingredients together.  They're non-damaging, and very low safety risk.  There's no chance that it would interact with the compound henna on your head now.  The color does wash out gradually with each wash, so you will have to refresh the color periodically.\n\nWella ColorFresh mask (Espresso), Maria Nila color refresh, Keracolor Clenditioner, Evelon Pro Color Mask, and Nirvel Nutre Color are just some options for you to look for.",

Sodium (hydrogen) sulfite is a pretty strong reducing agent so it'll probably reduce your quinone to the hydroquinone. Sodium thiosulfate and dithionite definitely do this really fast. It'll be easy enough to tell - if it decolorizes a small amount of quinone solution it's reducing it (to the hydroquinone, which is colorless).\n\nThe other thing that HSO3- does is form adducts with aldehydes and certain ketones by just attacking the carbonyl as a nucleophile. Not so much under acidic conditions like you have, although those quinone carbonyls are pretty hot for it. See the reactions section of the wikipedia page for sodium bisulfite if some pictures would help: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bisulfite. Again, decolorization will accompany this reaction, so you can tell very fast.\n\nTL;DR - I wouldn't be surprised if it reacts -- there's a couple of plausible things that my experience with naphthoquinones makes me wary of.

I gave the mixture a week  to settle nicely (as our room temp is less than ideal nowadays) . I tested Parodinal with a little snip of a (Fomapan 200 120) leader. The emulsion blacked instantly.   \n\n\nI loaded the film in darkness without any issues. I wanted to try stand dev but decided to go with the safer route and prepared a 1+50 solution. I used first 30 seconds constant, 5 seconds gentle agitation each 30 following seconds scheme for 9 minutes. Plain water (purified) stop bath, 6 min Ilford Rapid fixer, final wash a la Ilford (5,10,20 inversions).\n\nThe film looks fine. The sharpness and the contrast feels nice BUT the roll has a white streak in the middle. It's predominantly present in the middle five to six frames. I came across this problem before but I thought that it was linked with Caffenol (washing soda) specific problems or with using expired film.\n\nI know Foma 200 has sometimes quality control issues. I'm fairly sure that I developed this film in a pretty straightforward fashion. My camera is a an expertly CLA'd Yashica 124G from '79.\n\nDo you have any experience with this issue? All thoughts are welcome. Thank you.\n\n\\- Second photo shows the isssue.-\n\n \n\n[looks good,](https://preview.redd.it/v70ouo1195hc1.jpg?width=3568&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2a39aaf0d6b676f12a9ae26b9bc47934f160df9)\n\n[but...](https://preview.redd.it/4nz99p1195hc1.jpg?width=3568&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fea48745cc45a75c58c0767019bb48a8189e662)",

        "body": "That sounds like a rather roundabout method, and will probably work poorly as described due to formation of insoluble Cr2S3.\n\nIf you have hydrazine hydrate, you can probably go directly from an aqueous solution of dichromate to a Cr(OH)3 precipitate, but be sure to add the hydrazine dropwise. You can look up references on this. If you don't have hydrazine hydrate, you can reduce dichromate by refluxing in water/isopropanol mixture with sulfuric or some other acid. This will give you a soluble Cr(III) salt, which you can then turn into Cr(OH)3. I don't know how hard you'd have to heat it to get the oxide, you may need several hundred degrees.\n\nThe most direct and a relatively clean method seems to be just heating the dichromate to several hundred degrees to get 2 K2Cr2O7 -> 2 K2CrO4 + Cr2O3 + O2 , then washing with water to remove the soluble chromate. Another clean method is to add conc. sulfuric acid a concentrated aqueous solution of the dichromate to form insoluble CrO3, filter that off over a glass frit (not paper), then heat the CrO3 to a few hundred degrees to get 4 CrO3 -> 2 Cr2O3 + 3 O2. None of these chromium species are volatile unless you use a blast furnace, but the oxygen evolution from the solid will likely form an aerosol of the chromium, which is a significant hazard.\n\nAll in all, you should avoid doing this if you can. It'll take some effort and you have to do a bunch of handling with rather toxic compounds. Cr2O3 is very common and cheap, just ask around.",

It may not be at the top of most poeple’s to-do lists, but caring for your heart through a healthy diet and regular physical activity is the secret weapon to preventing heart disease. While many may assume that popping a few pills that your healthcare provider prescribed is enough to quell symptoms or prevent a heart attack, the real preventative power lies with real changes to your lifestyle – which can reduce the risk for heart disease by as much as 80 percent. Read on to find out how. Use the following tips to embark on a heart-healthy lifestyle to fight heart disease.\n1.\tSchedule a Yearly Checkup \n Your heart is in your hands. Each year on your birthday, schedule a checkup to have your blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels checked, and ask your doctor to help you reach or maintain a healthy weight. Be sure to follow your healthcare professional's recommendations, including taking prescribed medications as directed.\n2.\tGet Physical\n Step, march or jog in place for at least 15 minutes a day while watching your favorite TV shows. Increase your activity by five minutes each week until you're getting a minimum of 30 minutes most days of the week. If exercise and diet do not get you to your goal, ask your doctor about adding medication. Keep your numbers in check: Get Physical\n3.\tDrink More Water\n Take a water bottle with you wherever you go. It'll keep you hydrated and the bottle's weight will strengthen your arms.\n\n\n\n4.\tEat Healthy\n Keep packages of unhealthy food hidden. Put raw veggies and fruits in front in the refrigerator and healthy snacks in the front of the pantry, so that's what you see first. If you grab healthy foods for a minimum of 21 times, healthy choices will become a habit. Also, look for the American Heart Association red and white heart-check mark. This easy, reliable grocery shopping tool helps you identify foods that can be part of a sensible eating plan. Keep your numbers in check.\n5.\tControl Cholesterol\n Eating foods high in saturated fat, trans fat or cholesterol can lead to high blood cholesterol. To help keep your cholesterol levels down, eat foods low in saturated fat and trans fat, such as lean chicken or turkey (roasted or baked, with skin removed), fruits and veggies, low-fat or fat-free dairy products and whole grains.\n6.\tCut Down on Salt\n To help lower high blood pressure, watch your salt intake. It may be disguised in food labels as sodium alginate, sodium sulfite, sodium caseinate, disodium phosphate, sodium benzoate, sodium hydroxide, monosodium glutamate (MSG), or sodium citrate.\n7.\tQuit Smoking\n Try this four-step way to kick your habit:\n•On Day 1, cut the number of cigarettes you smoke by half\n•On Day 3, cut the number of cigarettes you smoke in half again\n•And on Day 5, cut your smoking in half again\n•On your Quit Day... quit!\n\n8.\tMaintain a Healthy Weight\n Excess weight increases your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. To achieve steady, painless weight loss, take it easy. Each day, if you eat 200-300 calories less than you would normally consume, and exercise at least 30 minutes on most or all days of the week, you'll get closer to your goal and be able to achieve weight loss that's steady and painless.\nIn addition to the physical toll a lack of exercise takes on the body, a whopping 65 percent of all American adults today are obese or overweight, increasing their risk for heart disease. So, follow these tips and make sure to care for your heart!\n",

But at a slightly more advanced level, you can also note that hydrochloric acid is not HCl, but HCl (aq). That is, when we say \"hydrochloric acid\", we are referring to an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride, which on its own is a gas.\n\nIf you dropped a block of anhydrous sodium sulfite into a bottle of HCl gas, yes, sodium sulfite wouldn't have any water to dissolve into, and so the reaction may be different or may not proceed at all.\n\n>it seems like it's a big leap to assume that any ionic compound will dissolve in any medium without water present\n\nIt's a leap to assume that any ionic compound will dissolve in any medium, I'll grant you, but water is not the only solvent which can dissolve ionic compounds, nor is it the only solvent in which ionic compounds can dissociate. Tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, for example, is an ionic compound which is poorly soluble in water but quite soluble in organic solvents such as acetonitrile, in which it can be used as a supporting electrolyte in non-aqueous electrochemistry.\n\n>an aqueous solution by definition is one where water is the dissolving solution\n\nBy the way, the term you want here is \"solvent\".\n\nHope this helps! Let me know what questions you have.",

Like DNA is acidic because of the phosphate groups that can act as an acid, and therefore DNA is basophilic.\n\nBut why are the basic dyes then described as cationic? Aren't bases usually negatively charged? I get that a staining molecule would need to have a positive charge to be able to bind to the DNA, but looking at the chemical structure of e.g. haematoxylin I can't see how it would be a basic dye, same for toluidine blue.\n\nLike with Orange G I can see that it has a phenol group and sodium sulfite that can act as an acid and ditch a hydron and thereby become negatively charged and bind to a positively charged acidophilic substance.\n\nOr am I completely wrong in my understanding?😵‍💫\n\nAny help is appreciated :)\n\n",

After only taking it for a month I've started experiencing symptoms such as a light rash on the sides of my face and swollen tonsils. The rash is very itchy and burns.  It's gotten hard to eat lately, and I'm forced to take small bites. My throat is not sore, and I have very mild congestion. A couple years ago I was proscribed a medication for a digestive issue that contained Sulfa and I had a similar reaction only worse. I went to the doctors and they said I was allergic to Sulfa and proscribed me a new one and everything was fine after that. After some research I've discovered that Aubra contains sodium lauryl sulfate. I've also had other experiences with things such as Pravana hair dye, which contained sodium sulfite, that caused my head to burn. Today I went to Planned Parenthood to try to change my birthcontrol to something else. I explained all my symptoms and told them my doctor said I was allergic to sulfa. The nurse proceeded by calling poison control and they got back saying that it was impossible that I was allergic to sodium lauryl sulfate because it's found in a lot of soaps and washes. She also claimed my tonsils were no different than average, however after recently going to the dentist a couple weeks ago, my dentist made a statement claiming my tonsils were abnormally swollen. My tonsils have yet to reduce in size, if anything I feel as if they have gotten bigger. After wasting an hour and a half waiting for a new pill, she claimed she couldn't give me a new one because of the insufficient evidence linking my symptoms to the pill. \n\nAm I allergic to my birth control? \n\nNothing in my life has changed since I started taking the pill, same makeup, shampoos and body washes.\nI'm a 19 year old female, 5'2 and Caucasian. I've had the same boyfriend for 3 years and have already been tested for any STD's and have none. I have no food allergies. I have no sign of fever and I drink lots of water and eat fairly well. ",

So there is a solution with the following ions mixed together Ag+(aq), Cu2+(aq) and Mg2+(aq) and then you have three other solutions which are sodium sulfite, sodium chloride, and hydroxide. And you have to add the solutions in an order which lets each ion in the solution to precipitate one at a time. And I have no idea how this would work.",

    "body": "Recently, I've switched to a new birth control called Aubra. After only taking it for a month I've started experiencing symptoms such as a light rash on the sides of my face and swollen tonsils. The rash is very itchy and burns. It's gotten hard to eat lately, and I'm forced to take small bites. My throat is not sore, and I have very mild congestion. \nA couple years ago I was proscribed a medication for a digestive issue that contained Sulfa and I had a similar reaction only worse. I went to the doctors and they said I was allergic to Sulfa and proscribed me a new one and everything was fine after that. After some research I've discovered that Aubra contains sodium lauryl sulfate. I've also had other experiences with things such as Pravana hair dye, which contained sodium sulfite, that caused my head to burn. \nToday I went to Planned Parenthood to try to change my birth control to something else. I explained all my symptoms and told them my doctor said I was allergic to sulfa. The nurse proceeded by calling poison control and they got back saying that it was impossible that I was allergic to sodium lauryl sulfate because it's found in a lot of soaps and washes. She also claimed my tonsils were no different than average, however after recently going to the dentist a couple weeks ago, my dentist made a statement claiming my tonsils were abnormally swollen. My tonsils have yet to reduce in size, if anything I feel as if they have gotten bigger. \nAfter wasting an hour and a half waiting for a new pill, she claimed she couldn't give me a new one because of the insufficient evidence linking my symptoms to the pill.\nAm I allergic to my birth control?\n\nNothing in my life has changed since I started taking the pill, same makeup, shampoos and body washes. I'm a 19 year old female, 5'2 and Caucasian. I've had the same boyfriend for 3 years and have already been tested for any STD's and have none. I have no food allergies. I have no sign of fever and I drink lots of water and eat fairly well.",

It is also added to sulfured molasses. Sublimed sulfite is ignited and burned in an enclosed space with the fruits.

Contains no preservatives..  \n**Doxsee (No MSG) Minced Clams:** A 61/2-ounce can yields 1/2 cup clam juice and 1/2 cup minced clam meat. The meat doesn't have the pinkish orangy color of the other varieties. This is the best of the canned minced clams. Not too tough, not artificially tender.  \n**Gorton's Chopped Clams:** A 6-1/2-ounce can yields 1/2 juice and 1/3 cup meat. Because the clams arc chopped. nor minced, the pieces are uneven, with larger pieces mixed in with smaller. MSG and sodium bisulfate are added to preserve color, and sodium tripolyphosphaw w retain moisture. Tastes bland.  \n**Progresso Recipe Ready, Gourmet Quality Minced Clams:** A 10-1/2-ounce can yields 2-3 cup clam juice and 24 cup meat. MSG is added to preserve color, and sodium tripolyphosphate to retain moisture. The final product looks chewed up, and some of the pieces taste chewy. The meat also looks bleached.  \n\n\n### [SMALL WHOLE CLAMS](http://www.free-easy-recipes.com/2018/09/the-right-canned-clams.html)\n\n**Cento Whole Shelled Baby Clams:** A 10-ounce can yields 1 cup clams and 2/3 cup juice. Contains the same additives as Gorton's and Progresso. Much lighter in color. Looks and tastes washed out. These clams seem to have been cooked longer and do not hold their shape very well.  \n**Chicken of the Sea Baby Clams:** A 10-ounce can yields 1 cup clams and a scant 2/3 cup juice. My favorite of the baby clam variety. With their soft texture, they don't feel overly cooked. They also look natural, neither too green nor washed out, and taste more clamlike than Cento or 3 Diamonds. Citric acid and calcium disodium EDTA arc added to promote color retention, sodium PF and sodium pyrophosphate to maintain flavor and firmness, and sodium sulfite as a preservative.  \n**3 Diamonds Whole Small Clams:** A 10-ounce can yields a scant cup of clams and 2/3 cup broth. Citric acid and sodium sulfite are added as preservatives. Very strong flavor. Bellies are very green and give the clams a bairlike flavor. A small crab was found in the can.  \n**Chopped fresh frozen clams** (available at most grocery store fish counters and [seafood](http://www.free-easy-recipes.com/) markets): These clams were as chewy as rubber bands, gritty and almost flavorless.

    "body": " [Chopsticks](https://www.bestchopsticks.com/) are an important component of Asian culture since they are the utensil of choice for meals, and the popularity of [disposable chopsticks](https://www.bestchopsticks.com/disposable-chopsticks/) has increased because of to-go restaurants. Today, chopsticks are commonly used around the globe, even though they originated from Asia.  The modernization of chopstick manufacturing is the result of increasing demand for these commonly used utensils; however, the production of disposable chopsticks consequently leads to the waste of raw materials and uses potentially harmful chemicals.\n\nThe lifecycle of disposable chopsticks from its creation to commercial distribution starts at the harvest of raw materials, resulting in a devastating impact on the surrounding environment by processes such as deforestation. By understanding the processes behind harvesting the raw materials used in the production of disposable chopsticks, we will have a better understanding of what steps are needed to limit the harmful effects of large-scale manufacturing on the environment.\n\nThe production of disposable chopsticks begins with the destruction of forests to harvest timber. Disposable chopsticks are primarily composed of aspen wood, but other organic materials such as bamboo, oak, and cedar are commonly used in the production of chopsticks. The woods used must have certain properties such as hardness and imperviousness to water in order to be used for chopstick composition. However, this process causes severe deforestation, as the 50 billion chopsticks produced from China cut down over 20 million trees. A mixture of heavy machinery and chainsaws are used to both cut down the trees and load the timber onto trucks to have the wood transported to a mill to be processed.\n\nThe machinery requires lots of fuel in the form of gasoline to power the chainsaw and heavy machinery. For trees on level ground, diesel-powered tractors are used to transport the fallen trees onto trucks for loading. Other machinery, like telescoping hydraulic yarders, are used for steep slopes in order to effectively collect the most amount of trees. If the trees are on level ground, the wood is dragged directly to the loading trucks. In contrast, if the trees grow on uneven ground, the wood is raised in the air and guided by guide wires to the loading trucks. The fuels are necessary to power the machines are extracted from crude oil fracked from oil-rich locations such as the Middle East and then processed into gasoline or diesel fuel to power the vehicles and tools necessary to cut down the trees.\n\nThe wood is then transported to sawmills where they are milled, steamed, and cut into the familiar chopstick shape. The milling of the wood consists of cutting the logs into small blocks to prepare for steaming so the wood will be easier to peel into longboards in later parts of the manufacturing process. Cutting and shaping the wood involves using a bandsaw, usually with a carbon steel blade. The carbon steel blade consists of material primarily comprised of iron and copper, but also has trace amounts of other elements such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, and titanium. These elements are smelted in blast furnaces to expel any impurities and input carbon to create a strong blade that will cut through wood with ease.\n\nThe blocks of wood are steamed in a steam box, made of a material that ranges from treated wood to PVC pipes. Steam boxes made of PVC are really made of vinyl chloride monomer, a synthetic material created by combining chlorine obtained through electrolysis of salt and ethylene in a reactor at high temperatures. The PVC steam boxes are attached to a steam generator, which uses water pumped through tubes made of alloy 600, a non-corrosive nickel-chromium-iron solid alloy. This alloy is created by combining the elements together at a very high temperature in a furnace.\n\nThis results in a product that is capable of withstanding high heat so water can be heated while traveling through the furnace without compromising the structural integrity of the metal itself. The water is heated in the tubes and produces steam that is injected into the steam box containing wooden planks. By steaming the wooden planks, they are making the wood more flexible and easier to peel. They are peeled using a veneer peeling machine equipped with a carbon steel blade, resulting in logs that are cut into thin boards, usually about 5 millimeters thick. These planks of wood are then cut again using a heat stamp that cuts the final shape of the chopsticks.\n\nThese chopsticks are then put into a chemical bath, but the process itself remains unknown to the public as the Chinese national standards have no record of this process, and companies withhold the details of this information in their manufacturing. In 2010, the Chinese government-imposed limits on chemical usage in chopsticks, but these limits were never strictly enforced. China’s lenient quality inspection has led to many chopstick manufacturing plants to operate with little to no scrutiny for the chemical treatment of its products.\n\nThrough alternative sources of experiments from other companies and individual investigators, chopsticks have been known to be treated with low levels of sulfur dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, sodium sulfite, and mold inhibitors. The U.S FDA restricts sulfur dioxide in fresh food to be 10 parts per million but does not impose that restriction on preserved or non-digestible products. Most of these factories are small workshops in remote areas, safe from any prying eyes and investigation by authorities. This reduces the restriction placed on these factories due to the lack of an effective quality control department to oversee production. Non-restrictive practices such as this give the chopsticks a yellow tint, indicating that those chopsticks are linked to excessive sulfur mixed into the wood.\n\nBased on reports done at small-scale chopstick factories, we assume this chemical treatment occurs after the wood has been cut into the final shape. There is a report depicting a large chemical bath, assumingly sulfur dioxide based on the description of a yellow liquid, with bundles of finished chopsticks being soaked in this bath. Sulfur dioxide is a waste product from processes such as burning fossil fuels and smelting mineral ores, where is then captured and used as an aqueous solution to treat the wood. This process requires a metallic sulfide, which comes from hard rock mining of metals in sulfide ores. The sulfide ores are extracted from mines in the form of minerals such as copper sulfide, iron sulfide, and silver sulfide and then smelted in factories to burn off the sulfur to purify the desired mineral. Instead of letting the sulfur dissipate into the air and cause harmful toxic effects, the gas is captured and liquefied by using ice and salts as well as high pressure to create an aqueous sulfur dioxide solution.\n\nThese finished chopsticks are then shipped out on cargo ships running mainly on heavy fuel oil. These tanker ships are some of the largest air polluters, using the lowest grade oil that contains the most amount of sulfur, causing enough pollution equivalent to the emissions of 50 million cars. They use crude oil that is hardly refined, often waste oil after other fuels like diesel and heating fuels are created. The chopsticks then are offloaded onto heavy and medium-duty trucks, using diesel or regular fuel to transport the chopsticks to the desired location.\n\nMost of these chopsticks are used once then disposed of when most wooden disposable chopsticks are compostable and can go in green bins. The end of the lifecycle of disposable chopsticks usually landfill, as very few chopsticks are reused in any way but new innovative and creative ways are currently being devised in order to minimize the waste created by chopsticks. In a few instances, people use creative methods to build sculptures and artwork to raise awareness of the environmental impact disposable chopsticks have on forests.\n\nHowever, there are new ideas to reduce waste by using wasted chopsticks to create biofuels. Companies are experimenting by using potassium carbonate to liquidate the chopsticks into a bio-oil with characteristics similar to diesel while being more efficient to heavy oil. These ideas, however, result in severe pollution like carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, so scientists are continuing to work on a way to utilize chopsticks effectively while minimizing the pollutants released from it.\n\nThe lifecycle of the chopstick is one that is severely wasteful, and the environment is paying the price, as well as possibly our health. Chopsticks use around 4 million trees each year in China alone with the majority of them ending up in a landfill since they are rarely recycled. Due to the leniency of health and safety policies of these rural chopstick factories, we don’t know the quantity or type of chemicals used to coat these chopsticks; instead, we rely on individual investigators to deduce the composition of the chemical baths used.\n\nHowever, there is starting to be a shift in people carrying their own personal reusable pair of chopsticks, usually made of metal, bamboo or plastic. This change is a gradual one, and there are still over 50 billion chopsticks produced each year in China, resulting in not only the waste from creating the product but also from using fuels to transport them all around the world via plane, boat, and trucks.",

Also, quest for new  alternative renewable energy source is quite argent and necessary.  Overall available technologies photoelectrochemical solar cell  technology has believed to be cost-effective and renewable energy source  for solar energy conversion. Generally, photoelectrochemical  performance of semiconducting materials depends on their respective  properties and essential physiochemical processes in which, i)  Absorption of light radiations, ii) separation of charge carriers, iii)  migration of carriers, iv) recombination of charge carriers and v) redox  reaction. Also, respective properties of semiconducting material are  nothing but, electronic band structure, crystal structure, chemical  constituents and their microstructures.\n\nII-VI group semiconducting compounds are the most  important and highly studied semiconducting material for scientific and technological point of application due to their direct  band gap \\[2\\]. Among this II-VI group semiconducting compounds, typically  CdS and CdSe have 2.40 and 1.70 eV optical band gap with wide  absorption band edge and excellent absorptivity in visible region \\[2\\].\n\nThese ternary CdSSe thin films synthesized by varied  of method such as, sputtering \\[3\\], Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD) method  \\[4\\]and solvathermal route \\[5\\]. All these methods require highly  sophisticated instruments, harsh experimental condition, different  surface directing agents and solvents \\[6\\]. However, in Arrested  Precipitation Technique (APT) their no need to use sophisticated  instrument, different solvents and harsh experimental condition. Taking  into concern these features of technique, we have used APT method for  synthesis of CdSSe thin films. APT method is nothing but hybrid chemical  process of CBD and Controlled Chemical Growth Process (CCGP) \\[7\\].\n\nIn present investigation, we have successfully deposited Cd(S0.8Se0.2) thin film using triethanolamine as complexing agent at via APT method. Our intension is to make efficient photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical application using triethanolamine as surface directing agent. Synthesized thin film show 0.37% power conversion efficiency under illumination of 500W tungsten filament lamp (intensity 30mW cm-2). Also, thin film formation growth process by using APT is discussed detailed.\n\n## [Experimental](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/AJOP.MS.ID.555575.php#Experimental)\n\n### [Chemicals](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Chemicals)\n\nAll chemicals were of analytical reagent (AR) grade and used without further purification. Cadmium sulfate hydrate (CdSO4.H2O) (98%, S-D Fine Chem.), thiourea (H2N-CS-NH2) (99%, S-D Fine Chem.) selenium metal powder (99.5%, Sigma Aldrich), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) (96%, S-D Fine Chem.), liquor ammonia (NH3) (28-30% Thomas Baker), and triethanolamine (N(CH2CH2OH)3) (99%, Merck).  \n\n### [Synthesis of Cd(S0.8Se0.2) thin film](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Synthesis%20of%20Cd(S%3Csub%3E0.8%3C/sub%3ESe%3Csub%3E0.2%3C/sub%3E)%20thin%20film)\n\nIn typical synthesis, initially Cd-TEA complex was prepared by triturating ‘Cd’ with TEA as complexing agent for 6 h homogenous crushing to form clear Cd-TEA complex. All metal ions and chalcogen ions precursors’ concentration is optimized at initial stage of synthesis as 0.05M. Cd-TEA complex release Cd2+ metal ions slowly and react with S2- and Se2- chalcogen ions released from dissociation of H2N-CS-NH2and Na2SeSO3 at alkaline pH, 10.4, and 50±2 °C bath temperature at 2.30h deposition time. Formation of thin films is well dependant on various preparative parameters such as, deposition time, bath temperature, pH and precursor concentration. These parameters were optimized during initial stage of thin film synthesis. \n\n After desired deposition time deposited film was removed from bath and washed with double distilled water and dried at room temperature in air. Deposited film was yellowish red in colour and designated as Cd(S0.8Se0.2).\n\n### [Characterization of thin film](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Characterization%20of%20thin%20film)\n\nThickness of film was measured using surface profiler (AMBIOS XP-1). Optical absorption spectra were taken by using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1800). Structural properties and crystallite size were carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS, D8) using Cu Ka (l= 1.5418 Å). Surface morphology and the elemental composition of the as-deposited thin films were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyzer (Hitachi, S-4700). PEC measurements were carried out using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley SCS-4200 Semiconductor) characterization unit using 500 W tungsten filament lamp (intensity 30mW cm-2) with sulfide/polysulfide electrolyte. \n\n## [Results and Discussion](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/AJOP.MS.ID.555575.php#Results%20and%20Discussion)\n\n### [Formation Growth mechanism](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Formation%20Growth%20mechanism)\n\n Main principle behind the film formation is slow ion-byion condensation of ions followed by multi nucleation process. Precipitation of metal chalcogenide thin films is occurred when ionic products (Kp) of Cd2+, S2- and Se2- ions exceed solubility product (Ksp) of Cd(SSe) in films. Slow release of metal and chalcogen ions from respective complex results into highquality and well-adherent thin films formation \\[7-9\\].\n\n### [Optical absorption studies](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Optical%20absorption%20studies)\n\nFigure 1 shows optical absorption spectrum of Cd(S0.8Se0.2) thin film recorded using UV-VisNIR spectrophotometer in 200- 1100nm wavelength range. Maximum light absorption edge observed at 650nm. Fundamental absorption corresponds to electron excitation from valance band to conduction band, used to determine value of optical band gap energy. Optical data were demonstrated using following eq. (1) as follows, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhere, A is a parameter that depends on the transition probability, h is Planck constant, Eg is optical band gap energy of material, and exponent depends on the type of transition. The values of n for direct allowed, indirect allowed, direct forbidden and indirect forbidden transitions are 1/2, 2, 3/2 and 3, respectively (Figure 1).\n\nFrom optical absorption spectrum clearly demonstrated that linear nature of plot confirms direct allowed type transition mechanism.\n\n Figure 2 shows plot of (ahϑ)2 vs photon energy (hϑ), value of optical band gap was calculated by extrapolating straight-line portion to X-axis. Obtained optical band gap energy is 2.13 eV, which is consistent with other reported ternary CdSSe thin films \\[7\\]. 3.3. X-ray diffraction study\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFigure 3 indicates typical X-ray diffraction pattern of Cd(S0.8Se0.2) thin film deposited by using APT method. All diffraction peaks are corresponding to (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200) and (112) at 2θ 26.02º, 28.40º, 31.13º, 42.80º, 44.93º, 50.89º and 52.07º of hexagonal crystal structure. Calculated d-values are in well-agreement with standard d-values (JCPDS card no. 49-1459) for an (hkl) plane, confirms formation of thin films with a pure phase material. \n\n Crystallite size is calculated by using known Scherrer formula and calculated crystallite size is 55nm. Thickness of thin film is 728nm measured by using surface profiler analysis. Crystalline nature and phase pure formed thin films are highly favorable for enhanced light absorption in solar cell application \\[8\\].\n\n### [Field emission scanning electron microscopy](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Field%20emission%20scanning%20electron%20microscopy)\n\nSurface morphology of thin films carried out by using FESEM study. Figure 4 demonstrates FESEM micrographs at different resolution of Cd(S0.8Se0.2) thin film. Low resolution FESEM image of Figure 4 (a) point out void free and well adherent film formation occurs via APT method. It shows twisted nest-like surface morphology is observed overall substrate surface. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh resolution FESEM images of Figure 4(b) clearly illustrate that twisting of nest-like morphology with irregularly grown sharp edged flakes. Such huge number of flakes winds together and formation of large network of nest-like morphology is observed from high resolution micrograph. This obtained surface morphology is beneficial for improve light absorption potential may due to crystalline nature and large surface area of nest-like morphology with twisted flakes \\[9\\]. \n\n### [Energy dispersive spectroscopy](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Energy%20dispersive%20spectroscopy)\n\nQuantitative analysis of element is confirmed through EDS study. Figure 5 shows typical EDS spectrum of deposited thin film. EDS spectrum shows peaks at 3.13, 2.50 and 1.38 keV confirm the presence of Cd, S and Se elements respectively \\[7\\]. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n### [Photoelectrochemical performance](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Photoelectrochemical%20performance)\n\nPEC performance of Cd(S0.8Se0.2) thin film was measured with standard two-electrode system. Figure 6 shows J-V curve of PEC cells. PEC performance was measured by forming Cd(S0.8Se0.2) thin film as working photoelectrode with active area 1cm2 and graphite rod (G) as counter electrode in 0.5M sulfide/polysulfide redox electrolyte. J-V measurements were done under illumination of light using 500 W tungsten filament lamp (Intensity of 30mW/ cm2). In dark, J-V curve shows diode-like rectifying characteristics. Upon illumination, curve is obtained at fourth quadrant, indicating generation of electricity and n-type conductivity nature \\[6-7\\]. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η %) of thin film were calculated by using equations (2) and (3) as follows, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhere, Jmax and Vmax are maximum short-circuit current density and maximum open circuit voltage, Pin is input light intensity (30mW/cm2). Jsc is short-circuit current density and Voc is open circuit voltage. From J-V measurement, short circuit current density (Jsc) is 0.288mA cm-2 and that of open circuit voltage (Voc) 765mV. Calculated power conversion efficiency is 0.37% for Cd(S0.8Se0.2) thin film. Overall obtained conversion efficiency might be due to good crystallinity and developed surface morphology with large surface area \\[9\\]. Table 1 shows calculated PEC parameter. \n\n## [Conclusion](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/AJOP.MS.ID.555575.php#Conclusion)\n\nDeveloped facile, cost-effective APT method shows potential for synthesis of thin films for solar cell. Synthesized thin film show promising properties favorable for photoelectrochemical performance is investigated. Optical study showed light absorption in visible region of solar spectrum and direct allowed transition mechanism. From XRD pattern it confirmed that formation of pure phase hexagonal crystal structure with nanocrystalline nature. FESEM analysis demonstrated synthesized surface morphology is void free and having large surface area for efficient light absorption. EDS pattern confirmed presence of Cd2+, S2- and Se2- elements in synthesized thin film. PEC performance indicated conversion efficiency of 0.37%.\n\n  \n\nFor more Open Access Journals in [Juniper Publishers ](https://juniperpublishers.com/index.php)please click on: [https://juniperpublishers.com](https://juniperpublishers.com/)\n\nFor more articles in [ Academic Journal of Polymer Science ](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/index.php)please click on:  \n [https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/index.php](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/index.php) \n\nFor more [Open Access Journals](https://juniperpublishers.com/) please click on: [https://juniperpublishers.com](https://juniperpublishers.com/)",
