    "body": "I don't even know what this thing is called but obviously it has escaped my attention while cleaning for some time. I saw some Irish Spring and impulsively bought it and used that and it worked great. I just applied some with a cleaning brush and then after my shower (10-15 minutes) I used that brush to brush it off. \n\nBeing impulsive I was like \"hey this says it's shampoo AND conditioner I wonder what would happen if I used it on my hair.\" If you have long hair DO NOT USE THIS LOL, I think it's only a conditioner if you have extremely short hair.\n\nAlso my hair smelled SO MUCH like Irish Spring and felt like I'd washed it with dish soap or something. The roots especially were flat and rough. Never again. \n\nI actually think the thing that makes it unusually good for cleaning might be why I hated it so much on my hair. It has Polyquaternium-7 and Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride which seems to be the \"conditioners\", and both are fairly \"sticky\"/substantive ingredient meaning it does a good job staying on things even if you try to wash it off. Probably helps it stick around while cleaning a bit longer than regular cleaners, but I did not appreciate it sticking to my hair and making me smell like a 20-something year old dude all day. \n\n",

        "body": "Some of the classic bar soaps such as Irish Spring and Dove are really good detergents (soap, but more specifically a compound that can bind to both water soluble and lipid soluble agents), Dawn soap as well. The reason why it sucks on your hair is because hair isn’t something you just want clean and stripped of oil, you want it clean but with a bit of something left behind so that hair can be sleek, shiny, and slip around without friction. Some shampoos do remove all the oils and products (typically clarifying shampoos) but following with conditioner will put back oils or silicones (depending on the formulation) so hair looks shiny, is slick, detangles and is frizz free. Additionally, some formulations use even gentler shampoos that have oils and silicones (usually curly hair formulations). Most have a gentle formula with a little bit of silicones to prevent breakage from friction. Hope that helps!",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: Do not use my work on any platform without prior permission. Ask first! \r\n\r\n\r\nHey everyone! So here I have a guide to moisturising/non drying body washes with experience test to see whether it’ll work for you or not.\r\n\r\nSo how do you find one? Its simple as you only have to find some ingredients i.e. Polyquaterniums(also referred as polyquats or PQ) OR  Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride(GHPC, let it stay on skin for a minute or two). \r\n\r\nThese are film forming agents that will form a protective layer on your skin. They have been around for a long time, intensively researched and can be used on your whole body including skin(including face) and hair. Since the silicone scare happened, their usage have increased exponentially. You’ll find them in your hair masks, shampoo, conditioners and even some face washes.\r\n\r\nSo you need to find one specific polyquat in your body wash i.e polyquaternium-7 (also written as polyquat-7 or PQ-7). This is the gold standard polyquat to help moisturize and soften the skin in body washes. Polyquat-10 will also do but PQ7 is the gold standard.\r\n\r\nSo now I’ll come to the test. This test is based on YOUR experience. So ik due to current pandemic situation you don’t wanna spend on unnecessary things. So I’ve mentioned the list of all body wash I could find with PQ7 and I’m sure that you would have used atleast one from them and if you felt that below mentioned products worked for you in the past and you left them thinking them to be too commercial or it moisturised or at the very least it was non drying to your skin, then Polyquats and GHPC are your gold ingredients to find in a bodywash. I will also mention some common tips that helped me after the products list.\r\n \r\nI went through whole body wash section on nykaa for this list. \r\n\r\nProducts list(including cheapest and expensive):\r\n\r\n1.\tPalmolive (absolute relax, morning tonic, luminous oils, sensual)\r\n\r\n2.\tNivea (Fresh pure, protect n care, energy, cool kick) \r\n\r\n3.\tCamay Paris (lavande, romantique, crème n strawberry, hypnotique, dynamique)\r\n\r\n4.\tBody Cupid (24k gold, beautiful rose)\r\n\r\n5.\tKaya (colloidal oat, tea tree n honey)\r\n\r\n6.\tBoro Plus (neem lavender, almond turmeric)\r\n\r\n7.\tSwiss Tempelle (tulsi&iris)\r\n\r\n8.\tWow (ubtan, rose otto, acv, peach & strawberry, pineapple n coconut, lemon n pine, pine n rose, melon n cucumber, green apple, valencia orange, cherry blossom, lavender n chamomile, tea tree n mint, wild aqua)\r\n\r\n9.\tAll nykaa wanderlust series(PQ7 + silicon oil)\r\n\r\n10.\tSolimo by Amazon (fresh lavender, sweet apricot, lemon n tea tree, cool menthol, antibacterial with SA)\r\n\r\n11.\tMamaearth (all PQ22 based)\r\n\r\n12.\tDettol all variants (PQ10 + BHA)\r\n\r\n13.\tPlum BodyLovin shower CREAMS (All are PQ7 based)\r\n\r\n14.\tSt. Botanica (peach n avocado, strawberry n vit e, argan oil)\r\n\r\n15.\tLove Beauty & Planet all range (cetrimonium chloride & GHPC based)\r\n\r\n16.\tSt. D’vence (ocean drop, pink salt, hemp n aloe, lime n basil, Alphonso mango)\r\n\r\n17.\tMan Arden (Pacific prince, tahitis exotic, lemon n mint, energising, bergamot n cedarwood, arabian oudh)\r\n\r\n18.\tSedure whole range (PQ is unconfirmed)\r\n\r\n19.\tOlay whole range (GHPC based. Needs to stay on skin for some time)\r\n\r\n20.\tSuperdrug (coconut n white peach, fruity coconut)\r\n\r\n21.\tAveeno daily moisture (PQ10 + GHPC), skin relief(GHPC Based)\r\n\r\n22.\tThink skin by big bazaar (neem, total moisture)\r\n\r\n23.\tLocal companies in your city.(usually found in supermarkets like dmart, big bazaar)\r\n\r\n24. Cetaphil restoraderm(GHPC)\r\n\r\n25. NMFe body wash(GHPC derivative)\r\n\r\n26. The skin cottage, whole range (PQ7 based. Some have different PQ)\r\n\r\n27. Moisturex body wash (PQ67 based)\r\n\r\n28. Sirona therapeutic body wash (GHPC)\r\n\n29. Dermadew body wash(PQ10) \r\n\n30. Parasoft moisturizing shower gel(GHPC+SQ8)\r\n\r\nTips: While rinsing out, try not to rub your skin. Use the softest towel you have. If possible only pat dry and avoid rubbing towel rigorously.\r\n\r\nConsidering the nature of polyquats, these products mostly will work the same for you. So that means you have so much fragrance options to choose from.😇 The list may or may not have fragrance free options. I haven't checked for fragrance. \r\n\r\nIf you are new to trying these ingredients, I personally recommend Nivea Fresh Pure for first timers. It has the softest foam ever. Very mild, fresh aquatic fragrance and has been on market for years. \r\n\r\nThere can be an instance where these products are not moisturising enough for you but they’ll be atleast non drying.\r\n\r\nAlways prefer to shop offline as most of nivea and some other brands are always on BOGO(like in dmart and big bazaar). Also be on the lookout for local companies in supermarkets bcz they will be even cheaper. (find PQ7)\r\n\r\nIF YOU HAVE A PRODUCT WITH ABOVE MENTIONED INGREDIENTS (PQ7, PQ10 OR GHPC) AND NOT IN THE LIST ABOVE THEN MENTION THEM BELOW SO THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE MORE OPTIONS. 😇",

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

I am using the L'Oréal Total Repair 5 and I have no complaints. \n\nThe most important thing in my opinion is the conditioner. Even then it's more about letting the conditioner sit and work for a few minutes that makes a lot of difference. I have tried Pantene, Sunsilk, TRESemmé and Garnier Ultra Blends conditioners and the Pantene works really well for my fine hair.

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

So, I don't care if Biotique is sulphate or sulphate free. I just know its gentle, and even if I use more, it never harms me.

Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

I had to test the products adequately before making my mind about them. Other than the products in the picture, I purchased the Milk Protein Shampoo Bar as well. Overall I am very angry at myself for trying these products out.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **0.5% FERULIC ACID, 15% VITAMIN C, 1% VITAMIN E MULTIVITAMIN AGE DEFENSE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C, Alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, D Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate)\n\n***My experience:***  This is the product I was the most excited about. Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum. It was clear when it arrived but has turned slightly yellow now.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Took a picture of the vitamin C serum. It turned slightly yellow now. It was clear when it arrived.](https://preview.redd.it/a5ikili8bjg51.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd81bcb46e515122c37d2f0c79d1440712e1a2f0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **COPPER TRIPEPTIDE + PHYTO CERAMIDE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phospholipids (and Sphingolipids, Copper tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.))\n\n***My experience:*** I wanted to include copper-peptides in my routine after Gothamista raved about them. I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

Also if one batches PH went wrong I hope they weren’t being cheap and informed the other people who purchased from that batch and refunded them.

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

I’ve been rotating this with my VaniCream Cleanser and I just want to be done with that so I can keep using this!\n\n**Name:** Pipette Baby Wash + Shampoo, Fragrance Free (https://pipettebaby.com/collections/bathing/products/shampoo-wash?variant=29620520616022)\n\n**Price:** $6-10 available in so many stores like Target, Ulta, Bed Bath & Beyond, Amazon, etc\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycerin, Coco-Glucoside, Glycolipids, Squalane, Citric Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Sodium Gluconate\n\n**What I Like About It:**\n- Large size: 11.8 fl. oz\n- Super affordable. When I bought mine, I got it for around $5. That turns out to be 43 cents per fl. oz\n- Easily available in so many stores. There’s always a store that has it on sale so it’s easy to pick it up for $6-7.\n- Simple, non-stripping ingredients that keeps the face hydrated, but is still able to remove sunscreen and make up. Sometimes, I don’t even bother double cleansing if my make up and sunscreen aren’t too resistant.\n- Cruelty free and vegan\n\nI honestly don’t have anything bad to say about this product. I was hesitant to make this review because I wanted to keep it on the DL haha! But, it’s so good! I’m glad I tried it based on a recommendation here. Never going back to regular cleansers. If it doesn’t work for you, you’re not out much at all.",

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

    "body": "# About me\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**24M**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin Type**: Combination to Dry (Cheeks often get flaky)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Climatic conditions:** Hot and dry weather\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Skincare Routine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AM:** Simple replenishing cream cleanser (the one being reviewed), Re'equil ceramides and hyaluronic acid moisturizer, Minimalist invisible sunscreen SPF40\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PM:** Garnier micellar water(1st cleanse with cotton pads), Simple replenishing cream cleanser (the one being reviewed), Aziderm 10% gel, Re'equil ceramides and hyaluronic acid moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# About the cleanser\n\n**Cleanser ingredient list**:  Aqua, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Lauroyl Taurate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide MEA, Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Benzoate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Methyltaurate, Stearic Acid, Cetrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Cocoyl Alaninate, Pantolactone.\n\n**Price**: MRP is Rs. 399. Got the product from Paytm ONDC for Rs. 199 (50% off coupon).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Quantity:** 150ml\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Packaging:** The cleanser comes in a cute pump packaging. Pump can be twisted to lock and unlock which will be helpful for travel. Refer to the image below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cleanser packaging](https://preview.redd.it/vqxzomkuovuc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=649c3171c0244b1d9614b79e9d103d984e140049)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cleanser texture:** The texture is creamy as the name suggests. Very similar to Cetaphil gentle cleanser, just a little more creamier. Consistency is runny just like Cetaphil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cleanser texture](https://preview.redd.it/ag9wyjnfqvuc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6d8189d598a85417d5eb3b24cc7079240c65177)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though it is Soap-free and very similar to Cetaphil gentle cleanser, it still lathers up quite well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lathering](https://preview.redd.it/luyjpocoqvuc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c058bb3a9a6ff7f29d07661e7861e8e7084c6833)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experience:** The cleanser cleansed my face very well. Lathered up decently and the application on my face was very gentle. It felt as if I was applying a body lotion on my face. Skin felt soft and clean after wash and face was not stretchy or dry. I used this cleanser as second cleanser in my routine after removing off my sunscreen using micellar water. I did not face any breakouts or bumps on my face so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe  cleanser is fragrance free. However it has that medicinal smell like other simple cleansers. Smell is a bit different and weird but not overpowering or irritating at all so can be ignored.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, it is a really good gentle cleanser which does not strip my face off of essential oil but still cleanses pretty well. It seems like a suitable replacement for my daily cleanser which is the simple refreshing facial wash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough it has only been a couple of days since I started using it so take this review as an initial impression for now. Will update the post after using it for a longer duration or if I face any issues with the product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to shoot your questions/queries and do let me know if I have missed out on anything since this is my first review here.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have accumulated a great deal of different shampoos from various indie companies throughout my time here and I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on them!\n\nSince everyone's hair is different, your experiences might differ from mine, so just keep that in mind! For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

    "body": "After seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/r613jf/my_experience_with_prose_finethin_curlywavy_hair/) on here, I was inspired to share my thoughts about my experience with Prose.\n\n**My hair:** 2A, fine-medium strands and medium density. It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The “factors” they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind. (who knows how much of this they actually factor in but whatever lol.)\n\n**Full Ingredients lists:**\n\n*Shampoo:*  Water, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl- Glucoside, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Jasmin Flower Water, Propanediol Dicaprylate, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, PPG-Caprylyl Ether, Pyridoxine, Panthenol, Jujube Bark Extract, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyquaternium-10, Tropolone, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Kale Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Spirulina Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Yucca Stem Extract, Arginine, Cannabidiol, Cocamidopropyl PG- dimonium Chloride, Grape Seed Extract\n\n*Conditioner:* Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance, Cetrimonium Chloride, Birch Juice, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-7 Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-7, Polyquaternium-10, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 20, Poppy Seed Oil, Plum Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cocamidopropyl PG-dimonium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**(These lists look pretty basic to me. But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them 🙄. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called “Odele Volumizing Shampoo” which I used before Prose. And yall… The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that’s what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

All the money you paid your stylist will go down the drain, as shampoos like this have pH levels way beyond the natural pH of our hair and skin, which can cause more harm than good.

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product?

I used their conditioner as well, and for a while, it made my hair nice and soft.  \n\nThen all of a sudden, my hair started to get extremely dry and tangled all the time. I am talking self dread locking, small animal around the nape of my neck tangled.  I first chalked it up to being winter and my jacket/scarf being the culprit, but as we moved into and through summer, same problem.\n\nI started changing conditioners, trying different ones, but nothing seemed to help.  I tried protien treatments and that seemed to help. Then I realized, it was not the protien treatment that was helping but the aphogee shampoo for damaged hair which had SLS in it. \n\n I have been experimenting with this theory and it appears that whenever I shampoo with the aphogee and my regular conditioner its fine.  If I use the SLS free shampoos I have, tangled, dry mess. I am thinking that the more natural shampoos just dont cut it (literally), I think there is junk left on my hair, which means that the moisture from my conditioner isn't penetrating in there and also that junk likes to stick to junk, causing tangling.\n\nIs there any rhyme to my reason or am I totally off base here?

At first, its was wonderful, felt super nice in my hair and for the first time in my life, my frizziness was gone just after using the shampoo and conditioner.\n\nI thought I'd found a shampoo that was perfect for my hair finally, but just recently, it hasn't been so great. For the first 2 weeks, all my frizziness was completely gone, but it seems it comes back more and more with each wash, and I've been getting little tiny flakes of either dandruff or product buildup. I always make sure to scrub my scalp with the pads of my fingers and work the lather down, and the conditioner absorbs so well  into my strands that there's barely anything to wash out after waiting a couple minutes. On top of that, my hair has been getting greasy on my second day, which never happened on any shampoo I've ever used (Suave, Tresseme, RegisDesignline, Big & Sexy, Paul Mitchell). I don't use any heat products or any other kinds of products to set my hair, so I don't think that it's because of damage or product buildup, unless it's somehow the shampoo itself. \n\nI'm really at a loss at this point and not sure if I should try a different line within Shea moisture, to give this one a bit more time, or to try a different brand.\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Shampoo**\n\nWater (Aqua), Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycol Stearate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Trichilia Emetica Seed Butter, Ficus Carica (Fig) Extract, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearamide AMP, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Honey\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Conditioner**\n\nWater (Aqua), Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyropermum Parkii (Shea) Butter *, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Trichliav Emetica Seed Butter, Behentrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Cellulose, Glycerin (Vegetable), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Ether, Honey, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) Tocopherol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG Propyl Silanrtriol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ficus (Fig) Extract",

It smelled SO lovely and it had been recommended to me by my sister who has defined ringlets so I thought I'd give it a go. I have 2c hair and oh man this stuff was a disaster for me. The top of my scalp was always so so waxy. Yes, I do mean waxy, not greasy. It had turned the hair on the top of my scalp into a straight (no longer wavy) waxy mess. I was full of dandruff, my head was also itchy (which made the dandruff even worse, and god I mean it was *insane* how itchy I was!!!) so I figured I should use more shampoo and really get it sudsing to wash it out. It made my situation worse. I was not using any product in my hair and going to work on the daily so it was always in a bun and I let it air dry almost every night, I was treating it right so I couldn't understand wtf was happening. \nAbout that time I decided I needed a hair cut and apologized in advance to the hair stylist and told her my woes (I'd never seen her before) and once I told her I was using this line of shampoo and conditioner she told me immediately to stop using it. The shampoo I had been using was full of too many oils and I wasn't clarifying my hair in any way. I was kinda drowning my hair in oil. The conditioner didn't really help much either. \nI haven't used their products since cause I was so upset from what it did to me. I know I used a different shampoo but there's something about this line that could never groove with my hair. I stole a pump from my sister's styling cream and it gave me a headache all day from the scent and my hair didn't take to it, either. \nI tossed my bottles in the end. You could try another one of their products that may actually wash your hair better and you can avoid all the dandruff but my experience has been bad with this line.",

There are little scalp focused products (although there are more lately in the form of scalp acids).\n\nThis line also has a shampoo but the treatment/conditioner is what I would really like to discuss. What's different, from just a glance, is that it's more \"dermatologically\" proven. It claims that the ingredients used are \"certified by Korean ministry of food and drug safety\" and it is also \"certified as low irritation through a rigorous skin patch test by Korean dermatology research institute.\"\n\nThis product REALLY caught my eye because I am constantly looking for more scalp-care products. It is my understanding that conditioner shouldn't touch the scalp, (especially if you are acne prone). I have a sensitive scalp prone to inflammation which is why I am very interested in scalp care. If this product is everything the marketing for it claims then this might just be a holy grail for scalp-focused skin-carers.\n\nPY's approach is interesting because most conditioner seem to be formulated as a hair conditioner first and skin conditioner second. In my experience, products formulated like this tends to leave an irritating residue as the consideration for the scalp is secondary. Their testing seems to be addressing this.\n\nI don't pay much attention to the hair loss claim in itself (only in terms of how much it improves scalp health which obviously affects hair health in the long term).\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:This hair conditioner is designed with scalp-contact in mind making this product stand out from most other I've seen on the market (something like a wash off scalp mask + hair conditioner)\\*\\*\n\nIt seems like a pretty new product (so long shot asking if anyone has used it) but this is product really caught my eye so I will try it out and report back.\n\nif this seems like an ad for this brand, it's not. I'm just really passionate about scalp health lmfao (check my posting history and rifle through the housewives and university posts)\n\nany thoughts on this product's formulation or comments on scalp-care asian products in general?

Everything I say here is my opinion based solely on their website content, and I've never tried their products or even heard of them before today. Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

I only used it this morning but I liked it a lot. It's not quite as thick as CeraVe in the tub, and it is slightly more shiny since it has grapeseed oil. To me this is a plus because CeraVe dries down too matte to feel moisturizing to me. It's also super cheap! $4.99 for 5.5oz and $9.99 for the full size. So if you're looking around for a new moisturizer, I would definitely give it a try. If you don't like it for your face, you can use it on your body. \n\nIngredients: Water, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide Np.

Of course, being the skincare junkie I am, I read the ingredient list and I was pleasantly shocked. \n\nIt has Colloidal Oatmeal and Oat Extract, along with Ceramides, panthenol and Caprylic Triglyceride. I used it as my second cleanse after a cleansing balm and it felt like it cleaned without stripping my moisture barrier. I almost want to switch away from my CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser because my skin is sensitive and I feel that the Oat component really soothed my skin. The price ($10) is also very good and fragrance free!

    "body": "Quite a long read since I list 3 shampoos’ ingredients. \n\nI ruined my hair (made it stringy and weak) using Garnier ultimate blends lemon and green tea shampoo before (which is no longer being sold, probably for this reason. Hasn’t been sold for about 3 years I think): \n\nAqua / Water,Cyclohexasiloxane,Nylon-12,Isododecane,Alcohol Denat.,Cyclopentasiloxane,PEG-10 Dimethicone,Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone,PEG-20,Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate,Disteardimonium Hectorite,Phenoxyethanol,Magnesium Sulfate,Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate,HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer,Titanium Dioxide [Nano] / Titanium Dioxide,Methylparaben,Acrylonitrile/Methyl Methacrylate/Vinylidene Chloride Copolymer,Tocopherol,Butylparaben,Aluminum Hydroxide,Isobutane,Alumina,Silica,Glycerin,Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate\n\nFast forward to 2 months ago I ruined my hair with Garnier ultimate blends coconut oil shampoo (I forgot this brand ruined my hair in the past):\n\nAqua/Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, CI 14700/Red 4, Cocos Nucifera/Coconut Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxycitronellal, Sodium Hydroxide, Theobroma Cacao Shea Butter/Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Caramel, Citric Acid, Hexylene Glycol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum / Fragrance\n\n(Though I do think my hair is bad with coconut oil, I’m not sure if that’s the sole reason as the result is basically the same as when I used this shampoo in the past) \n\nI initially thought that it’s because my hair is already dry and coarse (as well as low porosity fyi) that these shampoos didn’t do me much good as they have drying alcohols and a few sulphates, and nothing that is really moisturising or nourishing. Though, I thought about it more, and in between the two periods I ruined my hair, I was using this shampoo by Herbal & Essences which also does seem pretty drying, but didn’t damage my hair at all (from what I saw physically):\n\nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Magnesium Nitrate, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Rose Extract, Pearl Extract, CI 19140, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, CI 42090\n\nIt in fact has more sulphates, but also more humectants at the same time. Could it be the alcohol? Or is the problem in fact, not the drying of my hair? I’m really lost and scared to buy another shampoo in case I ruin my hair again.",

You will get a much better recommendation by making an appointment and they can even try out what you want to buy on you before you purchase and take it home! \nSide note: if you use a sulfate free shampoo always wash twice!

I'm in Canada and was using Live Clean shampoos and loved them, but wanted something in a bigger bottle as my boyfriend showers at my place often and we were just blasting through those little bottles together.\n\nI thought Yes To Carrots would be a great replacement, and at first it was fine. But after about six weeks of use, my hair is very dry and I'm experiencing itchy, flaky scalp for the first time in years. Granted, this could be due to the extreme cold weather we've been experiencing of late, but I'm pretty certain it was the shampoo.\nAlso, I'm not sure if the Live Clean shampoo contains silicone, and using Yes To Carrots simply revealed the true state of my hair (which is admittedly pretty damaged at the ends).\n\nEither way, I didn't enjoy the shampoo. On a more superficial note, the shampoo was very thick and difficult to squeeze out of the small opening (not an issue with the conditioner), so I unscrewed the cap and eventually just transferred it to a different bottle.\nAnd perhaps my biggest complaint: it BURNED my eyes! I'm not one to let shampoo run down my face in the shower, but I somehow couldn't keep this stuff far enough away from my eyes.\n\nAnd the conditioner, meh. It was fine. I'd buy it again, in fact.\n\nI notice that the reviews on the Yes To Carrots website are quite mixed. If you're curious about it and it won't damage your wallet, I'd still say it's worth a try.",

I am simply commenting on the lack of certain ingredients essential for a moisturising hair mask)\n\nIngredients list of biolage hydrasource:\n\nWater, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium chloride, stearyl alcohol, cetyl ester, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, isopropyl alcohol, aloe vera juice, limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, sodium citrate, hexyl cinnamal, coumarin, linalool, Butylphenol methyl propional, benzyl alcohol, hydroxycitronellal, Amy cinammal.\n \n(The one provided on nykaa is not for the Indian version.... 😐)\n\nIngredients list for aaranyaa hair pack:\n\nIngredients overview\nPurified Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Niacinamide, Emblica Officinalis (Amla) Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (Guar Gum), Eclipta Alba (Bhringraj) Extract, Acacia Concinna (Shikakai) Extract , Polysorbate 20, Vitamin E Acetate, Cedarwood Oil, Moringa Oleifera (Sahjan) Oil, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Seabuckthorn) Oil\n\n(I am not an expert on this, so if I'm wrong someone please correct me. Also if something works for you, then it works for you, ingredients list shouldn't be what makes or breaks it for you because cosmetic formulators are not idiots)\n\nThese are supposed to be moisturising hair masks... But here's the thing... there's no humectant... Not even one.\n\nBoth of these have fatty alcohol which provide that soft feel you'll be getting after using them and the cationic surfactant behentrimonium chloride will provide the slip for detangling but there's no humectant which imo feels like an essential ingredient in a hair mask, not even the humble glycerine... (Granted there is straight up water for hydration but really... Buying moisturising hair mask that depends on water for hydration?)\n\nI've seen curly hair influencers reviewing them saying though they provide slip they don't moisture their hair which kinda makes sense. These feel like detangling conditioners rather than moisturising hair masks. (again this is an opinion formed solely by looking at the ingredients list which isn't the be all end all)",

Any others who use/ have used their products? \n\nHey, first time poster here but a huge fan of the sub! I've been through many products the last year or so trying to find new products for my hair that fit me. I have long silky and straight hair but it gets easily split ends and can get very tangled in the mornings..\n\nI have recently tried a new brand though - the biosilk shampoo and conditioner plus silk treatment. I have paid much for hair salon shampoo and conditioners but these did not work as good as the biosilk products. I'm very surprised how good they work for my hair, the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair instantly combable after showering, which I've never experienced before! So long story short, why does the products work for me? Are the ingredients good long term? Any others who use or have used the products? If so, what was your experience with them?\n\n\nIngredients in the shampoo:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Polysorbate 20, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.\n\nIngredients in the conditioner:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Amodimethicone, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol , Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-8, Citric Acid, Benzophenone-3, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol.\n\n\nI noticed the conditioner has citric acid and cetyl alcohol in it, I've heard acid can let good moisture in the hair as well as bad stuff..\nAre the ingredients good for my hair/scalp? Should I continue using it without worry?\n\nThanks for replies in advance!!",

    "body": "So far I co-washed two times.\n\nFirst time I did it the lush way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage, wash, put significant amount of conditioner on hair from roots to ends, wait, wash. The hair was clean, I think it was too clean, there was more resistance when brushing vs after shampoo washing, there was significantly more hair left on my hands (and on the brush when brushing too I think) when applying the product. I think the hair was somewhat sticky and waxy, but not too much.\n\nThe second time I did it the easy way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage (and in the process get a bit on the hair and ends too), wait, wash. The hair was clean enough (not shampoo-clean, but I think that's better for my hair and for my scalp's accomodation). There was more resistance when brushign vs after shampoo washing (and I think also vs the first co-wash). There too was significantly more hair left on my hands when applying the product, but because it was applied only once it was this much less hair loss. My hair is sticky, waxy. It looks good, but feels really bad, because of the stickiness.\n\nI used warm water.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if I brush my hair downwards while leaning down, the hair will literally stay in the air afterwards as if I gelled it or something. This effect is present to some extent after I shampoo-wash too, but not this extremely. It's also quite difficult to brush in the first place.\n\nThe conditioner somewhat sticks to the hair even while washing with it, the consistency of conditioner is gluey, sticky, it doesn't make my fingers run through my hair with conditioner applied run buttery smoothly, but rather the complete opposite, I'm scared of pulling my hair out this way... No hair loss when rinsing it off. \n\nMy scalp is also itchy as fuck now. My guess is the preservatives Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are to blame, but the thing is the shampoo has them too, so maybe not and the waxiness or whatever (co-washing in general) causes this?\n\nI'm pretty certain that the conditioner causes this. I didn't use any other product. When I wash with just shampoo from the same brand (it's SLES based, but it's the opposite of potent, I take few times more of it to achieve the same potency that normal SLS shampoos have, could be the conditioner is similarly \"potent\") and either don't use any other product or only few drops of oil it won't be like this and it's pretty much what I want.\n\nThe ingredients of the conditioner:\n> Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Inula Helenium Extract, Humulus Lupulus Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Cera Alba, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Chamomilla Recutita Oil, Geranium Sibiricum Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-12 Dimethicon, Pinus Sibirica Needle Extract, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Ceteareth-20, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nNote that Cera Alba (Bees wax), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (guar gum derivative) and PEG-12 Dimethicon (water-soluble sillicon) are in it. Could it be that the Bees wax is the problem? The two other ingredients are water soluble so shouldn't be... Cera Alba (Bees wax) is also in the shampoo, but probably in smaller quantity.\n\nIngredients of the shampoo:\n> Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract*, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Glycine Soja Oil, Urtica Dioica Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Water*, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract*, Salvia Officnalis Oil, Carum Carvi Fruit Oil, Mel*, Saponaria Officinalis Root Extract*, Cera Alba, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nShould I buy another conditioner, keep on using this one or switch to non-harsh shampoo? If I should switch conditioner, what ingredients should I be looking for except no wax and sillicon? No oils? Other surfactants (glucosides instead of kationic chlorides)? Something more oily? Something very minimalistic (just kationic surfactans like cetrimonium chloride and humectants like cetearyl alcohol)? Something with more humectants?  I wouldn't be super happy buying another conditioner just to find out it's trash and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nEdit: My hair is ~5inch/13cm long.",

        "body": "I'm no expert and this is just personal experience over the past several years but I would try an SLS-free shampoo & silicon-/wax-free conditioner to see if that helps. It sounds more like an issue with the conditioner ingredients or other products sticking to your hair and scalp then not getting washed out with the co-wash so it builds up on your hair more and more. I tried many conditioners to co-wash and also water-only but neither worked for me. My hair ended up stringy, heavy and waxy though not as quickly as you have experienced. I have very hard water where I live which can also add to the problem.  You can also look into an apple cider vinegar rinse as an alternative (lots of info on the side-bar).\n\nI have had good success with SLS-free shampoo plus silicon-free conditioner every second wash or so. I only have to wash it once a week with water-only rinses as needed in between washes and my scalp is much less itchy and dry than when I was using regular shampoo or co-washing. When particularly dry and itchy, I use jojoba oil on my scalp as a mask/cleanse before I shower, massage it in well, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash out . This also helps with any build-up of product on my scalp.\n\nIt will probably take some trial and error to find out what works for you and a bit of time for your scalp to transition. You may also need to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build-up on your hair before starting over to give you a clean start but not everyone needs that step.",

        "body": "That's a very normal conditioning shampoo formula.  I wouldn't expect it to be particularly \"gentle\", given the sulfate cleansers but... If you like the way it makes your hair look and feel (and it's not outrageously expensive, because it shouldn't be) that's really what counts.\n\nIt's not necessarily bad (obligatory some people don't like sulfates cleansers, some people avoid heavy silicones) but there's also nothing special or unique about it.  \n\n**Edit**: I just noticed that it has zinc pyrithione in it, which can be a dandruff treatment.  I will check how much z.p. needs to be in a formula to be considered an active (edit: it's 0.3% for the control of dandruff (FDA final monograph [here](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/ucm111019.pdf), page 6 of the document).  That's plausible.  Not all the clear products seem to follow the labeling laws for OTCs though, and not all of the them even make dandruff-related claims, which might mean they're not all functional dandruff shampoos?  \n\n**OP, could you please give more information as to which shampoo in the Clear Line this is?  Is it being marketed as a Dandruff shampoo? Can you link to it?  I cant quickly find the one that matches the name in your title and the ingredient list in your post.**\n\n**Edit**: Just because it's interesting, Clear is owned by Unilever.  I thought it might be interesting to look at some of Unilever's other brand's products.\n\nHere's Suave Deep Moisture shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Dimethiconol, Fragrance, Carbomer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, TEA Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, PPG 9, Tetrasodium EDTA, TEA Sulfate, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, PEG 45M, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)\n\nYou can see it's pretty similar.  This one doesn't have the dimethicone, but the basic system is very close.\n\nHere's Dove Nutritive Solutions Daily Moisture:\n\n> Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycol Distearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Amodimethicone, DMDM Hydantoin, PEG-45M, Tea-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Cocamide Mea, Lysine HCI, Arginine, Peg-9M, Cetrimonium Chloride, PPG-9, Propylene Glycol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Red 33 (CI 17200).\n\nAgain, not identical of course, but pretty similar.  The basic sulfate cleanser + silicone is pretty common in \"moisturizing\" shampoos.\n\nIf your product is a real dandruff shampoo, here's a rival: Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Shampoo:\n\n> active ingredient: zinc pyrithione 1% inactive ingredients: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Dimethicone, Cocamide MEA, Zinc Carbonate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Magnesium Carbonate Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 5, Red 33, Blue 1\n\nNot identical again (could plausibly expect it to be a stronger cleanser), but same sort of idea.

That could *potentially* cause some problems on the scalp, but there are two caveats to what I'm saying: 1) GHC is pretty low on the ingredients list here, so it might not be enough to interact with the dimethicone to any significant degree 2) I've only read research on this in the context of binding to hair, not skin. I can't say whether or not the action would happen there too.\n\nSo if this is making you happy, then you're probably good to go. Just keep an objective eye on it for a month or two perhaps to see if there's any serious uptick in hair loss or dandruff. Like Hamfan said as well, it likely won't be very gentle to the scalp because of the sodium laureth sulfate, so if your skin is on the sensitive side, that might cause you some dryness and hair fall. \n\nKey word in all this being *might.*",

    "body": "Deep conditioning is a best practice to incorporate into your hair routine. Even if you feel your hair is not damaged, deep conditioners still help maintain healthy looking hair over time. Choosing how often to deep condition and which products to use can be a challenge. Deep conditioners go by many names, but are often thicker and heavier in their ingredient concentration.\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-deep-conditioning-your-hair.html))\n\n**What hair types and styles need deep conditioning?**\n\n* Long hair that feels dry\n* Chemically altered hair (examples: hair that has been lightened, permed, relaxed)\n* Naturally dry hair\n* [Damaged hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html)\n* [Hair with frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n* Swimmers that expose their hair to chlorine often\n* Beach lovers with sun-bleached hair\n* People with hard water, or who use well water\n* Anyone who frequently uses high heat to style their hair (ex: flat iron)​\n\n**What is the goal of a deep conditioning treatment for hair?**  \n​The two goals here are (1) hydration and (2) slip. Both help with the appearance and overall longevity of your hair's strands.   \n\n\nHydration\n\n* Silky, flexible strands (versus dry, brittle ones) with more shine\n* Smooth ends (versus puffy and frayed)\n* On curly hair - curls that form evenly (versus inconsistently)\n\nSlip\n\n* Reduces [tangling](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---tangles.html)\n* Reduces friction from [traction damage](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html) (to help hair grow)\n* Reduces[ frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n\n**How often should I deep condition?**  \nThis is unique to each person's hair type. Deep conditioning bi-monthly or monthly is common. If your hair is damaged, you can deep condition up to once a week. For more insights on how to fit deep conditioning into your routine, check out my post on [Hair Schedules](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-schedules.html).\n\n**What are the best ingredients for deep conditioners?**  \nBelow I've shared common ingredients you'll find in conditioner and/or deep conditioners. It's helpful to know what these ingredients are in case a company doesn't use the term \"deep conditioner\" on the product label. Other terms used for deep conditioning-related products are:  hair treatment, hair tonic, hair lotion and hair masque. You can also check out my post on [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html) for more insights on ingredient lists.\n\n* Panthenol\n* Glycerin\n* Amino Acids\n* Peptides\n* Cetyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol\n* Hydrolyzed proteins (ex: wheat, soy, keratin protein)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Quaternium-87\n* Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Dicetyldimonium Chloride\n* Distearyldimonium Chloride\n* Polyquaternium 55\n* Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride \n* Polyquaternium-44 \n* Cetrimonium Bromide\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride\n* Laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \n* Polyquaternium-4\n* Polyquaternium-10\n\n**How should you deep condition your hair?**  \nI've listed the process I recommend to my clients to help them get the best hydration and slip below.\n\n* Shampoo twice with clarifying shampoo, or use a regular shampoo plus a detox treatment, and rinse well.\n* Ring out most of the water from your hair, and/or soak it up with a towel.\n* Apply conditioner or deep conditioner from roots-to-ends.\n* Massage conditioner and water into your hair. Good coverage equals a better result. This can look like a combination of the techniques below. You can read more about the squeezing and scrunching technique [here](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/) in Cosmopolitan.\n   * untangling\n   * working in sections\n   * pressing root to tip\n   * gentle squeezing\n   * scrunching\n   * combing\n   * gathering all the hair together​\n* Let the deep conditioner sit for between 10-20 minutes on thicker hair or 5 - 10 minutes on finer hair.\n* Dunk hair in water using a sink or cup, or just quickly rewet in the shower.\n* Use the techniques listed above to press more water into the hair.\n* Do a final rise. On drier hair, this can be a quick rinse that leaves more conditioner residue. On finer hair, you'll want to do a more thorough rinse to prevent the deep conditioner from weighing your hair down. \n* Add leave-in products.\n* End with drying and/or styling  method of your choice:\n   * ​Air dry (avoid this method if it will take more than one hour to dry)\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with cold air\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with hot air and [heat protection](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html)\n\n**Can you over-condition hair?**  \nIf you are experiencing hair that appears:\n\n* limp, flat or heavy\n* to have build up or residue\n* straighter than you'd like\n* greasy or too shiny\n\nthen you could be over-conditioning. Try cutting back on the amount of deep conditioning treatments in your routine, switching conditioners to one that is for volume, or lightly shampooing after you condition.

    "body": "Hi, all!\n\nI recently switched shampoos and am now experiencing mild breakouts on my back and around my hairline.\n\nPrior to the switch, I was using Herbal Essence's Hello Hydration shampoo and conditioner. While using this shampoo and conditioner combination, my hair seemed dry, frizzy, and fragile. However, it did not cause me to break out anywhere.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium 76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nA little over a week ago, I stopped using both of the above products and switched to SheaMoisture's Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo to try to get away from sulfates. I started only with the shampoo, not the conditioner, because I break out very easily and wanted to test each product separately so that I'd know what product was causing me to break out if I did indeed end up breaking out (it's a mistake I've made before).\n\nThe ingredients in that shampoo:\n\n> Deionized Water, Decyl Glucoside(Coconut Oil), African Butyrospermum Parkii (shea Butter)*, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Argan Oil, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Rosemary Extract, Sea Kelp Extract, Vitamin E, Guar Gum, Lonicera Capifloium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Avacado Oil\n\nAfter a little over a week of using this shampoo every other day, I've noticed a change in my hair. It seems healthier, less frizzy, and easier to manage. I LOVE the improvement. However, since the change, I've also experienced breakouts on my back, around my hairline, and on my cheeks where the ends of my hair touch my face. This makes me incredibly sad, because I love what this product does to my hair, but the breakouts mean I can no longer use it.\n\nAre any of the ingredients in this shampoo particularly comedogenic? Which one(s) could I be reacting to? I really like the change this product made to my hair, so is there a shampoo similar to this one that is less likely to break me out?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nIf it helps identify ingredients I might be sensitive to, a long time ago, I dyed my hair black, and after noticing that the Hello Hydration Shampoo made the color fade quickly, I switched to Herbal Essence's Color Me Happy Shampoo and Conditioner. That stuff broke me out horribly. I know that it was the shampoo and/or conditioner and not the dye because I didn't switch products immediately after dying my hair but waited a few weeks. I experienced no breakouts during that time and only broke out after switching shampoo and conditioner. I switched to both at the same time however, so I have no way of knowing whether it was the shampoo, conditioner, or both that caused me to break out.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Red 33, Red 4, Yellow 10\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Benzyl Alcohol, EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 10, Red 33, Yellow 6",

I'd like to share it and also include other products I have tried below:\n\n**-Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash**: \n\n**Ingredients**: Water (Aqua), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Parfum), Bht, Tetrasodium Edta, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\n**My thought:** this product is unscented but does contain masking fragrance. Fragrance is listed on the ingredient list. I tried using it as a body wash and also doubled up as hand soap, and either ways I found this product fairly drying. It makes my skin tight and uncomfortable. Not my favorite body wash.\n\n**-Olay Eczema Prone Skin Soothing Body Wash:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Petrolatum, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Trideceth-3, Niacinamide, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Citrate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Glyceryl Oleate, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Vitamin B3.\n\n**My thought:** This product is a recent discovery of mine and I love it! It's truly fragrance free and unscented. The texture is fluffy, moisturizing, but rinses clean without leaving behind any residue. I also use it as hand soap and it works perfectly. This has to be my favorite body wash I have found so far.\n\n**-Eucerin Skin Calming Body Wash**: \n\n**Ingredients:** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Laureth-4, MIPA-Laureth Sulfate, Poloxamer 101, Laureth-9, Propylene Glycol, Water, Propyl Gallate, BHT.\n\n**My thought:** I tried this product a few years ago but didn't end up repurchasing. It’s fragrance free but not truly unscented in my opinion. It has a chemical/fish oil smell due to the omega oils which I imagine can be bothersome to some people. It’s also quite liquidy so you have to use a lot and it runs out quickly. Overall, the texture is just not as pleasant to use as the Olay one.\n\n**Sum up:** Olay Eczema Prone Skin Soothing Body Wash is the best one I have found. I'll attach picture of the product below in case anyone is interested.",

Iirc polyquats are even more difficult to remove than amodimethicone, but why bother? These ingredients impart shine and smoothness and are somewhat protective (among other things). Your hair does not contain living cells and does not require nutrients to be delivered into the inner core, nor does it require water inside the hair shaft. In fact, from my research less water in the hair shaft is ideal. So a layer of emollients will do more good than harm imo.\n\n\nObviously buildup will occur after some time, and when this occurs you can always use a clarifying shampoo. I was strictly no sulfates/silicones for a few years for my curly hair. Nowadays knowing the science behind things, I don't understand the movement.",

        "body": "There seems to be some disagreement about which cleansers remove which silicones. Amodimethicone is definitely one of the harder silicones to remove. My shampoo has that same cleanser, and some people describe it as essentially a sulfate while others say it's the most stripping of the non-sulfates but still weaker. If it were me, I would go by how my hair feels. If your hair seems gunky, sticky, or like it won't detangle the way it normally would, you can throw in a suave daily clarifying wash. If not, maybe your hair just likes being coated in silicone (or the shampoo is cleaning adequately) and you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to watch out for is that those heavy silicones tend to prevent oils from getting to your hair, so if you feel like your hair is really dry, or like the texture of it when unconditioned is getting worse, that may be a sign to switch conditioners or at least do a sulfate wash and use a silicone-free deep conditioner before you resume using the amodimethicone one.",

(Context: I have a fairly dry scalp, wash roughly once a week, and have fine hair in good condition.) Most of the things I've tried included sulfates, which could be the culprit, but the old formula skips a lot of common shampoo ingredients so I'm not certain. I'm not familiar with the function of many of these chemicals, and I don't know how much of a difference this will make to the effects of the shampoo--  **How worried should I really be here? Is this likely to make my scalp grumpy, or likely to be fine?** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp me HaircareScience, you're my only hope!",

Their whole thing is they have co-ops in Africa for shea production and almost all their products contain it. So this got me thinking: is there a shea shortage? I did some basic googling and it seems like maybe. A few years back (2015) someone posted that the trees skipped a season, which happens every decade. Some also said that a strain on cocoa production was leading to the use of shea as a substitute.\n\nAnyway, maybe that's why they reformulated. Or maybe it was for other supply chain reasons, or something else.",

    "body": "In early January 2020, actress and hairstyling enthusiast [Taraji P. Henson]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraji_P._Henson) launched her haircare line, TPH. The collection is currently sold exclusively at Target, both in stores and online. The line contains 18 products and is not designed to be exclusive to any hair type.\n[Five beauty editors at Allure](https://www.allure.com/story/tph-hair-taraji-p-henson-review) – including three who have Type 4 hair – tested the products and had complimentary things to say.\n\n##Product Details\n* __Price:__ $9.99 + tax for 12 oz. (355 mL)\n* __Hair Type:__ Curly & Coily\n* __Appearance:__ White conditioner\n* __Texture:__ Thick (maintains shape when poured); non-greasy feeling\n* __Scent:__ Light natural scent – shea butter, olive oil, sage oil; scent does not linger\n* __Marketing Spiel:__ Hustle & Co is an ultra creamy, suds-free conditioning cleanser that deeply refreshes while moisturizing your coils, curls, and waves. No side hustle (in this case additional conditioner) necessary- Hustle & Co delivers hydrating goodness into your hair without stripping your hair of its natural oils. To use, wet hair and apply a generous amount to hair and scalp. Massage in with your fingertips and rinse. Repeat if needed.\n\n##Ingredients (NOT CG-APPROVED)\nwater (aqua/eau), cetyl alcohol, glycerin, isopropyl palmitate, behentrimonium chloride, ISODODECANE, fragrance (parfum), cetrimonium chloride, AMODIMETHICONE, phenoxyethanol, laureth-4, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-7, ethylhexylglycerin, panthenol, trideceth-3, trideceth-15, disodium edta, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, aminomethyl propanol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, salvia officinalis (sage) oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, limonene\n\n###Method\nFor each wash, I poured an Oreo-sized mount of conditioner. I spread the conditioner out over my scalp and massaged vigorously for about two minutes. I then took a paddle detangling brush to spread the conditioner down to my ends and undo knots for somewhere in the 3-5 minute vicinity. I rinsed for about one minute.\n\n##Results & Observations\n * The product spreads super-easily. I got great coverage and had no trouble brushing it down to my ends.\n* While my hair was saturated and even after rinsing*, my hair had a TON of slip and I could have detangled manually if I had wanted.\n* The product absorbs into my hair very quickly. Even  after three washings and trying longer-than-usual rinses, I wasn’t entirely sure that I had most of it out.\n* I would have expected my Overtone to bleed, but the water rinses out 99.7% clear. My color looks as good as it did on the day I applied it.\n* My hair feels soft and amazing now, wet or dry. \n* My hair is super, *duper* shiny.\n* I’m getting much better than average volume at the roots, which lasts through my second day.\n* Either I’m not rinsing well enough or the product is too heavy for my ends to support. I have 2b/2c hair on Day 1 and wake up with 1c hair on Day 2.  (Which I am totally willing to let slide for how nice my hair looks and feels.)\n\n#Conclusion\nI’m deeply impressed with the salon-like power of this product for its drugstore price. I’m ready to kick my existing shampoo and leave-in conditioner off the shelf and make TPH a permanent fixture in my shower.",

I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up?

I always thought soft silky elastic hair = moisturized which is why I am writing this post because it no longer feels soft and silky, it feels rough.\n\nHeres the Shampoo  https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133656/Kirkland-Moisture-Shampoo/Unlisted-Brand/Hair \n\nIngredients: water sodium cocoyl isethionate cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine methyl isethionate disodium cocoyl glutamate sodium lauryl sulfoacetate decyl glecoside ammonium cocoyl isethionate divinyldimethicond/dimethicone copolymer disodium laureth sulfosuccinate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract glycol disterate glycerin fragrance quaternium-91 sodium cocoyl glutamate peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate amodimethicone panthenol polyquaternium-10 ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate chlorphenesin methyl gluceth-20 guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride c11-15 pareth-7 laureth-9 phospholipids hydrolyzed vegetable protein pg-propyl silanetriol c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate trideceth-12 superoxide dismutase sodium ascorbyl phosphate tocopheryl acetate methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone\n\nConditioner: http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133657/KIRKLAND-MOISTURE-CONDITIONER/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water cyclopentasiloxane cetearyl alcohol stearyl alcohol cetrimonium chloride behentrimonium methosulfate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract helianthus annus (sunflower) seed extract glycereth-26 dimethiconol divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer fragrance gluconolactone cetrimonium bromide panthenol ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate jojoba esters quaternium-91 amodimethicone hydroxyethylcelloulose cetrimonium methosulfate sodium benzoate c11-15 pareth-7 peg-45m laureth-9 aminomethly propanol glycerin butyrospermum parkii ( shea butter) c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride (sunscreens) trideceth-12 citric acid ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate sodium ascorbyl phosphate butylene glycol hydrolyed soy protein tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) hydrolyzed vegatable protein pg-propyl silanetriol\n\nedit: Some more info, My hair is just above shoulder length, when i get in the shower i use a wide tooth comb to get rid of knots then i soak my hair with warm water then lather the shampoo all over scalp and from root to end then rinse then i take a huge blob of Conditioner and use it the same way and leave it in for 1-2 minutes then rinse with cold water.\n\nThanks for the help!

It is color treated (because I have some greys) and I rarely use heat to style. The one upside it that is tends to be very soft (except when I pick the wrong product and dry it out). \n\nI am getting so turned around and confused with all the hair care advice I read. I am currently using [HairStory](https://www.hairstory.com/products/new-wash/) and it is going alright, but that s\\*&t is expensive. I made the mistake of using a leave-in that came in an Ipsy bag ( [FoxyBae Magic Daily Leave In Hair Mask - 12-in-1](https://www.foxybae.com/products/12-in-1-magic-daily-leave-in-hair-mask)). It was good the first time I used it but now my hair is feeling a bit grubby (so I guess I need to use a clarifying shampoo). I like to wash my hair ever other day, but on day two I always have to wear it in a ponytail. I'm tired of fighting it every day and spending a fortune on stuff that never seems to work. \n\nI have tried CG method, untold products for decades, products for curly hair, products for wavy hair, products for fine hair...). If I don't wash my hair frequently my scalp itches, so I have never managed more than three days. It takes my hair a long time to air dry, so I hate washing it because I have to go to work with wet hair or sleep with wet hair. \n\nI just want my hair to be moisture/protein balanced and not weighed down. I don't like complicated hair routines and prefer to use little or no product outside of shampoo and conditioner. I occasionally use [L'anza Bounce Up Spray](https://www.ulta.com/healing-oil-bounce-up-spray?productId=xlsImpprod18041073) and that seems to be magic. I have [Olaplex](https://olaplex.com/) 3 and it worked great the first time and has had diminishing returns since. I also have Olaplex 6 and it feels heavy in my hair. \n\nI tried that hair in water test and it never sunk despite leaving it in the cup for over an hour; however, I hear that this test may not be that helpful.

I’ve use the shampoo and conditioner for about six months, and I’ve tried the hair mask and oil from the same line. The Ghost hair mask is very light, so if you felt weighed down by others, definitely try that one. I use the oil sparingly at night any time my ends feel dry and I always wake up to super soft hair. I bought one of those [shampoo brush things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZDXFL6?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) for a scalp massage while shampooing and that feels nice and I think my roots are less greasy for longer.

I eventually found Ology and tried it out- I hated it. I didn't feel clean and my hair felt heavy. After that, I learned about the no poo method and started washing my hair with baking soda. One time I ran out though, and forgot to make a new solution. I would have been late, so I just washed my hair with the Ology that was already in my shower. This time I LOVED it and I'm still using it. My hair is very shiny/soft and it feels light and clean. Plus, my shoulders don't break out!\n\nSo the common shampoos to Ology was a bad transition, but baking soda to Ology was great. I recommend trying it out.",

I posted this in the Daily Questions thread yesterday, but hope I'll get more visibility this way. \n\nIs/was anyone else a fan of the [Skinfix foaming oil cleanser from before their brand overhaul and move to Sephora](https://www.influenster.com/reviews/skinfix-foaming-oil-cleanser-34oz)? This is my absolute favorite second cleanser — I love the super-creamy, rich, dense foam and the barely-there scent, and it leaves my skin feeling so clean but never dry or tight. (I have very dehydrated, combination skin.) But with Skinfix's brand overhaul a year or two ago, it seems they've not only updated the packaging, but [reformulated it as well](https://www.sephora.com/product/barrier-foaming-oil-cleanser-P442836). I've been subsisting on a panic-driven eBay haul of the original version ever since but will soon be down to my last bottle. Sad.\n\nHere are their relative ingredients lists (looks like they mainly took out most of the fruit extracts, which might not be so bad?):\n\n**Original:** Water/Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Panthenol, Betaine, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydrolyzed Chondrus Crispus Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rose Extract, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower/Leaf Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Extract, Rubus Ideaus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n**New (Barrier+) version:** Water/Eau/Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycol Distearate, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Gluconolactone, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Tocopherol, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Coconut Acid, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate.\n\nHas anyone used both versions — or just the new one — and are you willing to share your thoughts? I'll probably end up purchasing the new version anyway, just to try it, but I'd love to have some insight beforehand, if possible! \n(I'd also appreciate any recs for similar cleansers from folks who've used the old one before!)",

    "body": "  MooGoo’s Natural Full Cream Moisturizer has a gorgeous silky feel on the skin and isn’t heavy at all. It is, according to the MooGoo website: \" For everyone and everywhere. Use on face & body, all ages and skin types\".  \nThe cream was quite moisturizing on my face. It has a light, pleasing fragrance (which coming from me is saying something – fragrance typically triggers migraines for me and I usually avoid it like the plague). It has a very delicate honey-milky-vanilla scent that fades fairly swiftly after application.  \n Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite heavy enough for me on its own (my skin is quite badly dehydrated at the moment). It’s a cream that I would really like to try the slug method with. I finished my bottle, sadly, and didn’t get the opportunity to try Vaseline over the top of it (I only just learned about the slug life!) which I think would be fantastic for dehydrated skin - it contains some really nice skin-repairing ingredients. I’m definitely planning on getting it again and I’m going to try out some of their lip balms, too. \n\nA word of caution: this cream does contain numerous oils, so if that’s a known acne-trigger or sensitivity of yours perhaps steer clear! It didn’t break me out and I’m usually quite prone to pimples if something disturbs my skin; however, YMMV. The company is also very responsive and helpful about answering questions about their products. \n\nFull list of ingredients copied from MooGoo’s website: Aqua (H₂O’s Fancy Name), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol (Plant-Based Emulsifying Wax) and Polysorbate 60 (Food Grade Emulsifier), Glyceryl Stearate (Food Grade Emulsifier),  Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Aloe Vera), Squalane (Olive), Piroctone Olamine (Olamine Salt), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (Guar Gum), Mel (Honey), Allantoin, Acetum (Apple Cider Vinegar), Natural Pear Fragrance, Natural Vanilla Fragrance, Hydrolysed Milk Protein (For Skin Elasticity), Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract.",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This baby shampoo includes gentle plant-derived cleansers like Decyl Glucoside and Cocamidopropyl Betaine. Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate also contributes to the product's cleansing ability and can help moisturize the skin. It's worth noting that Phenoxyethanol is a preservative that's generally safe, but has been linked to skin irritation in some cases. The product also contains several beneficial oils and extracts that can nourish and soothe the scalp and hair. However, the presence of an essential oil blend for fragrance can cause irritation for some babies, especially if they have sensitive skin or underlying conditions like eczema.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Propanediol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Tocopherol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin (Vegetable), Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Flower Extract, Vanilla Planifolia (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Boswellia Serrata (Frankincense) Extract, Commiphora Myrrha (Myrrh) Resin Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend). Certified Organic Ingredient. Fair Trade Ingredient. Natural ingredients may vary in color and consistency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Phenoxyethanol\n   * Phenoxyethanol is used as a preservative in cosmetic products and also as a stabilizer in perfumes and soaps. Exposure to phenoxyethanol has been linked to reactions ranging from eczema to severe, life-threatening allergic reactions. Infant oral exposure to phenoxyethanol can acutely affect nervous system function.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some cases, phenoxyethanol can cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction, presenting as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin and may be more susceptible to such reactions.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though less common, some people may experience an allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol, which could result in symptoms like hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Eczema: It is also a common allergic reaction to skin exposure of products containing one percent or more phenoxyethanol. Reactions only occur in the area of application and eczema subsides after avoidance of the product causing irritation.\n      * Acute nervous system effects (infants): In 2008, the FDA warned consumers not to purchase Mommy’s Bliss Nipple Cream. Phenoxyethanol, found in the cream, was depressing the central nervous system and causing vomiting and diarrhea in breast feeding infants. Symptoms of a depressed nervous system include a decrease in infant’s appetite, difficulty waking the infant, limpness of extremities and change in skin color. There is no known health risk to the mother.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Cocamidopropyl Betaine\n   * Cocamidopropyl betaine is a surfactant commonly used in personal care products, including baby lotions, due to its mild cleansing and foaming properties. It is generally well-tolerated and considered safe for use. However, in some rare cases, individuals may experience certain side effects.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Although uncommon, some individuals may be sensitive or allergic to cocamidopropyl betaine. This can lead to skin irritation or allergic reactions such as redness, itching, rash, or hives. If your baby develops any of these symptoms after using a baby lotion containing cocamidopropyl betaine, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.\n      * Eye Irritation: Direct contact of cocamidopropyl betaine with the eyes may cause mild eye irritation. It is important to avoid contact with the eyes and rinse thoroughly with water if accidental exposure occurs.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Rosa Centifolia (Cabbage Rose) Flower Extract\n   * Rosa Centifolia, also known as Cabbage Rose, is often used in skincare products for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Its extract, when used in baby shampoos, provides a gentle and natural way to cleanse the skin and scalp. Although Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract is typically safe for most people, as with any ingredient, it might cause some potential issues.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some individuals, particularly those with sensitive skin, might experience irritation, redness, or itching due to Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Some individuals could be allergic to the extract, leading to allergic skin reactions such as itching, redness, swelling, or rash. In rare cases, more serious allergic reactions could occur.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n   * Sodium Benzoate is a type of salt that's used as a preservative in many types of products, including food, beverages, and personal care products like baby body wash and shampoo. It's generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States when used in appropriate amounts. That said, there are potential side effects to be aware of, especially when used in higher concentrations or by individuals with specific sensitivities\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some individuals, particularly those with sensitive skin, may experience skin irritation when using products containing sodium benzoate. Symptoms can include redness, itching, or a rash.\n      * Allergic Reactions: In rare cases, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to sodium benzoate, which could result in hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Potential Interaction with Vitamin C: When combined with ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), sodium benzoate may convert into benzene, a known carcinogen. However, the conditions required for this reaction to occur are typically not present in personal care products, and the FDA regulates the amount of benzene allowed in products.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fragrance\n   * \"Fragrance\" in the ingredient list of baby shampoo (and other personal care products) is often a catch-all term for a mix of various scent-producing chemicals. Fragrances can make products smell pleasant, but they can also cause some potential side effects, especially in people with sensitive skin or allergies. In babies, who generally have more sensitive skin than adults, these side effects might include.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Allergic Reactions: Although it's not common, some babies might have an allergic reaction to certain fragrances, which could lead to symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing. These reactions might not occur the first time the baby is exposed to the fragrance, but could develop after repeated use.\n      * Sensitization: Regular exposure to certain fragrances can lead to the development of a sensitivity over time, where the body starts reacting to a substance that it was previously okay with. This can lead to allergic contact dermatitis, a type of eczema.\n      * Respiratory Issues: Inhaling some fragrances can trigger respiratory symptoms, particularly in babies with asthma or other pre-existing respiratory conditions.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

    "body": "Purple shampoo never toned well for me, so I've been on the hunt for purple conditioners that function effectively and are CGM-approved. There are not many in the recommended products list, and adding semi-permanent dye to my conditioners, as the guide recommended worked very badly (I had color in it months later!). So I went on a search for approved conditioners and this is what I found!\n\n*My hair:* Definitely wavy and not curly, relatively fine, color-treated but weirdly protein sensitive despite that (????), naturally dry, high porosity, long. My coloration isn't dramatic - I basically go from a dark blonde to having honey-colored highlights. \n\n**Pura d'Or ColorHarmony Purple Conditioner** - This one is nicely pigmented - I can leave it on 3-5 minutes and be toned, though I usually leave it 7-10 - and moisturizing. My hair generally feels nice and soft afterwards. It has glycerin, though not high on the list; regardless it works best for me if I use it within the 30-60 dewpoint range. It has some protein, but not too much - my hair has never gotten strawlike after it as long as I moisturize adequately. I really recommend it. \n\n*Ingredients**:*  Decolorized Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\\*, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract\\*, Glycerin\\*, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol (1-Hexadecanol, 1-Octadecanol), Colocasia (Taro) Esculenta\\*, Biotin, Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract\\*, Citrus Aurantium (Orange) Peel Extract\\*, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Bambusa (Bamboo) Vulgaris\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\\*, Keratin, Biotin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Saponins, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Zinc Sulfate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Oil\\*, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil\\*, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil\\*, Xylityl Sesquicaprylate, Citric Acid, Ext. Violet 2 (CI 60730). \n\n**dHue Cool Blonde Conditioner -** This one is less pigmented - reports are that it doesn't tone well for certain people - and has more protein; overall I enjoy it less and find it more drying, but I have it in my arsenal because it's glycerin free and I need it for \\~30 and 60+ dewpoints. I've kind of just worked out how to use it - every 2nd or 3rd wash, leaving it in for 10 minutes, followed by a moisturizing, protein-free conditioner (so I condition twice overall *on top of* a leave-in). With that in mind, it works perfectly fine; it tones decently and my hair still looks nice. \n\n*Ingredients:*  Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Pa\u001drfum), Citric Acid, CI 60730, Acid Violet 43 (Ext. Violet 2). \n\n**Note on the Shampoos:** The shampoos associated with these conditioners have questionable ingredients for CGM and are pretty drying. I do find they're good clarifying shampoos every month or two, but wouldn't personally use them on a regular basis since my hair is already dry.\n\nHope this helps!",

A few weeks ago I used [Overtone Espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/henna/comments/1gg42bd/before_and_after_espresso_overtone_conditioning/) and this week I used Aura Bold Sonoma red. I've been using these over henna for over two years and they don't seem to affect dye uptake when I eventually henna the roots, but I do clarify with a sulfate shampoo and do hard water treatment before doing henna. The Aura masque certainly added some color and does help the roots blend even if it doesn't fully cover grey. However, it dyes the scalp much worse than Overtone does and overall the color is a bit dull for my taste.

I'd gotten serious about CGM over a year ago and have been pretty dedicated to SM products, because anything else is fairly hard to find in my area and DevaCurl costs way too much. I was using the SM smooth & tame shampoo (twice a week) and conditioner, a leave-in, and the coconut hibiscus curl & style milk. All products should've been ok for my curl pattern.\n\nAnyway, the stuff going down around DevaCurl got me reading up on build-up with products that are silicone-free. I fell down a rabbit hole regarding polyquats and ingredients that bind like polyquats such as Behentrimonium Chloride and Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride. I was also getting concerned about oils building up on my hair as the ends were starting to dry out and my hair was simultaneously getting unmanageably greasy, like it did back when I had silicone build up. \n\nI decided to do a clarifying wash with a shampoo with sodium coco sulfate (because apparently that will remove polyquats): The Green Beaver Company's Volumizing Lavender shampoo. It's a Canadian \"natural\" brand that i got for cheap at Winners. Anyway, while brushing conditioner (Desert Essence Coconut) through my hair with a detangling brush, the build-up started coming off my scalp in tiny white chunks (probably hardened oils). It was very alarming. I always brush product through with a detangling wet brush before plopping and there's never been hard white chunks in it before.\n\nI used Suave Coconut Conditioner as a leave-in this time (holla, Dollarama!), along with a little aloe vera gel. I already had a hair loss scare a little while ago where it was coming out in clumps. It's growing back in, so it probably wasn't due to build-up and was probably just hormones stuff (I did see my doctor about it), but I don't want to take anymore chances, especially with DevaCurl allegedly destroying people's hair. Has anyone else had this happen to them with SheaMoisture? I loved their products so much, but I think I'm totally done with them.\n\n(Edited to add: I have also used SM's \"build up blaster\" but it clearly does not actually remove build up!)",

This happened with another company a few years ago iirc.  I already was doing a clarifying wash about every two months because my hair is really fine and even a little buildup will weigh it down, but recently I stepped it up to every two weeks to be safe. I also don’t use products with a lot of protein because my hair isn’t really damaged (due to keeping it short), and I feel like too much protein is more harmful than helpful.",

It was around my hairline in the middle of my head, in patches more than all over. I called it dandruff, though I'm not sure *what* it was, as I got small white flakes in my hair around the same time. I bought E45 shampoo, which (as far as I remember) stopped the itching and helped me cope with it while it cleared up. \nI don't remember my scalp being abnormally itchy over spring or summer, but late autumn this year it's got really bad again. A couple of weeks ago I noticed it getting steadily itchier, and unfortunately I'm guilty of scratching it more than I probably should, at one stage to the point of it bleeding slightly. Again, it's usually worst in one or two patches, but it's so horribly itchy that once or twice it's stopped me from sleeping properly until I either give up and scratch it or put moisturiser in the places where it's worst (which stops it for a short while but makes it necessary for me to wash my hair in the morning.) The other day I accidentally scratched it, and a yellowy scale-flake thing came off, which is (I think) the first time that's happened. This time around, E45 has done nothing for me. That might have something to do with the fact that I've been trying to cut out harsh cleansers from my usage and E45 shampoo has Sodium Myreth Sulfate in it. What I'm using at the moment is a shampoo called Child's Farm, which is in fact a baby shampoo that's been 'dermatologically approved' and 'paediatrician approved' and 'suitable for eczema' but it hasn't been doing much for me. It cleans my hair/scalp perfectly well, and for a while afterwards my scalp isn't itchy, but about midway into the day or the next day, my scalp's back to being itchy again. \n\nI'm really sick of having an itchy scalp, and I don't know if it's down to the cold/wet weather (it's been foggy and cold and rainy recently), too much of something in my diet, or just sensitive skin that is now affecting my scalp. I've heard of and can get Neutrogena T-Gel, but it's expensive and I don't want to try it unless I know it could make a difference. \n Has anyone out there gone through this and come out the other side? Is it just an awkward phase of itchiness or is there some magical thing that I haven't heard of that can bring it back to being healthy and itch-free again?\n\nIf anyone's curious, the ingredients in Child's Farm shampoo are as follows: Aqua, Sodium Coco-Sulfate,  Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Argan Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Parfum, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Lauryl Glucoside, Limonene, Lactic Acid, Sucrose Laurate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil*, Citric Acid, Alcohol, Amyl Cinnamal.\n\nEdit: wording",

        "body": "Seborrheic Dermatitis is the fancy tern for the dandruff spectrum, though it's usually just used for the severe side of the spectrum. It typically causes flakes and the bigger, more severe flakes in more severe cases are typically yellow and often greasy. It's very closely related to eczema to the point that eczema of the scalp is usually diagnosed as SD, and some people think they are completely the same disorder. Both are associated with an overgrowth of a particular microbe that is supposed to be on our skin. Its technically a fungus. The overgrowth irritates the skin and when the immune system goes after it, even more damage is done to the skin, which just lets the microbe overmultiply more. Ketoconazole shampoo (nizoral) is very good at attacking that particular fungus, as is monistat cream, but obviously ask your pharmacist or doctor because I'm not either of those things. Tea tree oil 5% in shampoo is also supposed to be very effective against that kind of microbe.",

It took a while before my hair really showed the damage it was doing, but it is seriously parched now. I'm doing deep conditioning treatments, pre-pooing with oils, etc.   I wanted to try it because it's cheaper than my SheaMoisture and more readily available, but it is not worth it.  I did try the conditioner also but wasn't wowed- it felt a bit waxy to me.\n",

I feel like I have zero way to predict whether my scalp will like a shampoo or not; some with supposedly \"harsher\" ingredients work great for me and others that are \"gentler\" make me super dry and itchy! I have to stick to low-poo because my low-porosity, medium-thickness 2C hair gets weighed down really easily. I desperately want to experiment with new shampoos but I have no way of narrowing down which ones might work for me!!\n\nHere are some of the products I've tried, how my scalp liked them, and their ingredients.\n\nTHE BODY SHOP GINGER SHAMPOO - Somehow? this is the nicest of all the shampoos I've ever tried on my scalp?? I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm. I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky.

The strands feel like they won’t run over eachother no matter how much product is on them the hair just knots up, and webs together even if I’ve managed brushed out the section is just does this all over again and feels like straw\n\nI’ve tried multiple different products and spent so much money.\nDoes anyone have any idea what could be happening or any advice?\n\nBack-story:\n\nI have fine long curly hair that was already kind of dry before this due to bleaching but easily manageable and styled and I absolutely loved it! I would’ve said it was high porosity, low density and 3a/3b\n\nJust over a month ago I don’t know what happened but I washed my hair one time with a really old bottle of “Tresemme Keratin 7 Day Smooth Shampoo” (ingredients below) As soon as I got out the shower my hair WAS HORRENDOUS. No matter how much conditioner I used I couldn’t get a brush through it, and the conditioner was almost foaming up?! I genuinely couldn’t brush my hair after 4 hours of trying. I immediately went to the hairdressers, she tried to wash out my hair, did Olaplex treatments on it, and deep conditioned it. After that she just about managed to brush it out. But that was a month ago and I haven’t been able to brush it properly since :(\n\nI’ve tried everything. Harsh shampoos, gentle co washes, deep conditioners, hot oil treatments, olaplex, silicones & sulphate free AND tried bringing them back in to my hair too. It just seems to reject everything I put on it and feel like unbrushable straw regardless\n\nThe ONLY thing that’s worked is the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yoghurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment on my hair for around an hour, keeping it warm.

    "body": "TL,DR:\nI want to add a leave-in conditioner to my routine and would like to know if I can use a regular, CG approved conditioner for this and if there are any ingredients to avoid. \n\n—————————————\n\nHey all,\n\nI’ve recently figured out my hair is actually curly and not straight but unruly. Now I’m trying to figure out what products to use. For the past 30 years I’ve been washing with sulfates and often conditioning with silicones, towel drying (not gently), brushing damp hair after and blow drying with high heat. So I’m sure I’ve got a decent amount of damage. I’ve had some success the past week co-washing, using gel and plopping, but I would like to add a leave-in conditioner. I live in Europe so a lot of the recommended products are hard to get or very expensive.\n\nI have low porosity hair and I think 2b-2c waves. Unfortunately my hair was thinned out A LOT with thinning shears during my last haircut so my upper layers lack definition and are very frizzy. \n\nRoutine: co-wash with Neutral conditioner, STC rinsing out 90%, add Wella New Wave rock & hold extra strong gel when still wet, plop for 30 minutes and air dry.\n\nI bought [this](https://www.hollandandbarrett.nl/shop/product/dr-organic-tea-tree-conditioner-60083573) conditioner, as well as the [manuka honey](https://www.hollandandbarrett.nl/shop/product/dr-organic-manuka-conditioner-60083585?skuid=083585&promoId=3480009) and was wondering of it would be alright to use as a leave-in. It’s CG, this is what’s in it:\n\nAloe barbadensis leaf juice, Aqua, Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl alcohol, Melaleuca alternifolia (Tea tree) leaf oil, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea butter), Glyceryl caprylate, Panthenol, Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, Mentha piperita (Peppermint) oil, Tocopherol, Helianthus annuus (Sunflower) seed oil, Sodium benzoate, Potassium sorbate, Sodium phytate, Limonene.\n\nIs this a matter of experimentation or are there ingredients to definitely avoid?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Also a hair mask won't really do much beyond a conditioner for a doll's hair as it's basically plastic and won't absorb things the way natural hair will. Your best bet is a cheap sulfate free conditioner mixed with a little fabric softener.",

Two of those Organix products you listed have Dimethicone, which is a silicone.  Can't tell if the shampoo is ok but I have checked a few Organix shampoos at my local drugstore and I found a few with sulfates.  \n\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo is also listed there but has sulfates.  I found out after I've been using it for almost 2 months :(.  The YTC conditioner is ok though. There is also a Garnier Fructis that I made the mistake of buying but thankfully I verified the ingredients before using it.  \n\nThat \"search ingredients\" link is sadly another site that hasn't been maintained for a while :(\n\nIf you need product recommendations, try the pinned post at the top of this subreddit and scroll towards the bottom for the product recommendations.  There is also a product recommendation link at the sidebar in /r/haircarescience.  But before you buy, google the ingredients just in case the manufacturer changed ingredients",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This baby shampoo has gentle cleansing agents like Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate and Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate. However, the presence of Pyrithione Zinc signifies the shampoo is aimed at treating specific scalp conditions, such as cradle cap. It's important to use this only under a healthcare professional's advice for infants. The formula also includes Apple Extract, known for its antioxidant properties, and Panthenol, beneficial for skin hydration. Despite the inclusion of Phenoxyethanol as a preservative, it's typically safe in concentrations below 1%. Always perform a patch test to monitor possible allergic reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Pyrithione Zinc, Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Acrylates Copolymer, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Hydroxide\n   * Sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda or lye, is a strong alkaline compound that is sometimes used in the manufacturing process of personal care products, including baby lotions. It is used to adjust the pH of the formulation to ensure stability and efficacy. However, it is important to note that sodium hydroxide itself is not typically listed as an active ingredient in baby lotions, but rather used in very small amounts for pH adjustment purposes.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Sodium hydroxide, if present in higher concentrations, can cause skin irritation in some individuals. This may manifest as redness, itching, burning sensation, or rash. It is important to discontinue use if your baby experiences any of these symptoms and consult a healthcare professional.\n      * Eye Irritation: Direct contact of baby lotion containing sodium hydroxide with the eyes can cause mild to moderate eye irritation. It is crucial to avoid contact with the eyes and rinse thoroughly with water if accidental exposure occurs.\n      * Chemical Burns: Sodium hydroxide is a caustic substance and can cause chemical burns if used undiluted or in high concentrations. However, in properly formulated baby lotions, the concentration of sodium hydroxide is typically low and safe for use.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Zinc Pyrithione\n   * Zinc Pyrithione is a coordination complex of zinc that's primarily used as an antifungal and antibacterial agent. It's often found in products like dandruff shampoos, certain types of soap, and some skin care products due to its ability to treat seborrheic dermatitis, an inflammatory skin disorder that causes flaky, scaly patches on the skin. In baby shampoo, Zinc Pyrithione would likely be used to help manage cradle cap (a form of seborrheic dermatitis in infants) or other minor skin conditions. However, it's worth noting that not all baby shampoos will contain this ingredient, as its use will depend on the specific formulation of the product.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some individuals may experience skin irritation, including redness, itching, or a rash, particularly if they have sensitive skin.\n      * Allergic Reactions: While rare, allergic reactions can occur. Symptoms might include severe redness, itching, hives, or swelling. In extreme cases, difficulty breathing could occur, which requires immediate medical attention.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product with Zinc Pyrithione gets into the eyes, it can cause redness, watering, and irritation.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 6\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Phenoxyethanol\n   * Phenoxyethanol is used as a preservative in cosmetic products and also as a stabilizer in perfumes and soaps. Exposure to phenoxyethanol has been linked to reactions ranging from eczema to severe, life-threatening allergic reactions. Infant oral exposure to phenoxyethanol can acutely affect nervous system function.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some cases, phenoxyethanol can cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction, presenting as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin and may be more susceptible to such reactions.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though less common, some people may experience an allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol, which could result in symptoms like hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Eczema: It is also a common allergic reaction to skin exposure of products containing one percent or more phenoxyethanol. Reactions only occur in the area of application and eczema subsides after avoidance of the product causing irritation.\n      * Acute nervous system effects (infants): In 2008, the FDA warned consumers not to purchase Mommy’s Bliss Nipple Cream. Phenoxyethanol, found in the cream, was depressing the central nervous system and causing vomiting and diarrhea in breast feeding infants. Symptoms of a depressed nervous system include a decrease in infant’s appetite, difficulty waking the infant, limpness of extremities and change in skin color. There is no known health risk to the mother.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

Thanks in advance :)\n\nAM: Splash w water\n\nLight moisturizer: For the summer- Avene cleansing lotion (using as an emulsion)- it has the same ingredients as the emulsion so I assume it could be used as a moisturizer... correct me if I am wrong PLS or tell me if it is not a good idea. \n\nMy other option is the etude house soon Jung emulsion. (let me know ur thoughts if u have tried either) Probably will only use the cleansing lotion or emulsion in the summer when needing a lighter moisturizer. Until then I will use the etude house barrier cream before my spf. \n\nSunscreen: Drmtlgy tinted moisturizer spf 44 (physical sunscreen)\n\nPM: \n\nMicellar water by garner to remove sunscreen/makeup\n\nCleanser: Pipette baby wash/shampoo- weird that it is a shampoo I know, but someone on this sub swears by it and the ingredients seem really great.

IDK... ? thoughts?\n\nSerum: Cocokind ceramide serum- I have never used a serum, but I have heard great things about this and I know ceramides are great for the skin. Since they are not in my moisturizer I figured I could add them in this way...\n\nMoisturizer: Etude house soon Jung 2x barrier cream-heard great things\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAvoiding exfoliants while I try and repair my moisture barrier.\n\nConsidering incorporating slugging into my routine some nights, but I don't know what to use or if it is a good idea.",

        "body": "I'm not gonna explain every ingredient because I honestly have a lot of homework to be doing and reddit won't give me the room for it all in one comment, but I'll give you the highlights and a general conclusion.\n\n**Shampoo:** \n\n- Has mid-strength anionic surfactants (e.g. sodium cocoyl alaninate, disodium and sodium cocyl glutamate), so a good sulfate-free alternative but there are even gentler things out there. The up side is these surfactants also function as conditioners.\n\n- The main surfactant sodium bis-hydroxyethylglycinate coco-glucosides crosspolymer is a non-ionic which is the gentlest kind of surfactant. It's a cleansing, foaming, thickening, as well as conditioning agent. Also biodegradable, which is helpful when we think about how much of all these products get washed down our drains.\n\n- Glycerin is a common humectant that pulls water into the hair and is thus very beneficial in a shampoo where you want the shower water to replenish your moisture content.\n\n- Parfum (fragrance): The fact that this is so high up on the ingredients list gives me a little worry. Fragrance can be almost anything, and most fragrance ingredients contain phthalate esters which have been linked to many health ailments. The presence of this ingredient in the first third of the list leads me to believe that it is likely in a concentration near or above harmful when used in long exposures (but almost all plastics we have around us also emit harmful levels of these chemicals into the air so it's not like the absence of this shampoo will make everything all better, nor are you guaranteed to get diabetes or breast cancer just from being exposed like this. It just raises the risk). \n\n- Arginine: an amino acid with significant protective abilities. When used in the presence of bleach, [reduces protein depletion](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15645092). Also improves hair growth by [stimulating blood flow to the follicles](http://www.aminoacid-studies.com/areas-of-use/hair.html?PHPSESSID=jof4d69o6cc5gonk508kplsd04).\n\n- The others are mainly conditioning agents to coat the hair strand and improve it's softness, shine, and manageability or are emulsifiers to hold the whole mixture together. \n\n- **Conclusion: Pretty good shampoo. Not the best thing you could ever find, but this will be better for most people than sulfate shampoos. For your SD though, it may still be too harsh so pay close attention to see if you get itchiness, redness, and flakes when using this shampoo, especially because most people with SD need to wash every day and that means more exposure to it.**\n\n**Conditioner:**\n\n- Cetyl alcohol: a common fatty alcohol used in hair products. It coats the hair to protect it from protein damage and loss as well as seal in moisture, both of which this compound is pretty good at. May clog follicles and weigh down fine hair, however, so try not to use this much on your scalp. \n\n- Avocado oil: Another conditioner that coats. Rather thick, so this plus the cetyl alcohol may mean this conditioner is too heavy for fine hair, but avocado oil also has some vitamins and amino acids to protect from protein loss. Not penetrative however, so not a ton of this benefit. \n\n- See above for fragrance, arginine, protein.\n\n- Citric and ascorbic acid are lower pH than your hair, so they will tighten up the hair shaft and help make it shinier. [Some evidence](http://www.ergo-log.com/vitchair.html) also suggests that exposure to ascorbic acid can help protect hair follicles from the hair loss effect of androgens. \n\n- Nearly all of the other ingredients are various conditioners. \n\n- **Conclusion: I don't think this is the best conditioner for you. It might be too heavy on your thin hair, and will probably irritate your SD. You could try pairing it with a clarifying shampoo though and see if that makes it more bearable.**\n\n**Serum:**\n\n- cyclomethicone and cyclopentasiloxane: silicones, but the gentlest class of silicones. Most penetrative to water molecules and easiest to evaporate and remove in the shower. \n\n- [C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700898/C12-15_ALKYL_BENZOATE/): A fairly long-chain alcohol and thus conditioner. Suspected to be an environmental toxin. Soluble, won't build up. \n\n- Silk amino acids are great at strengthening the hair and partially rebuilding damage. \n\n- Shea butter is a heavy but effective emollient. \n\n- Coconut milk and oil are some of the best conditioners out there and also penetrate to deliver moisture and reparation. \n\n- Egg whites and acetate have some reconstructive power, but probably aren't doing much this far down the list. \n\n**Conclusion: sounds pretty good, but will probably work best if you apply it to damp hair rather than dry so that it don't lock out moisture and doesn't feel greasy.**",

I never knew about silicones, sulfates and that basically all the ingredients in a shampoo is harmful (*sarcasm intended ffs)* before I go on a rant, here's a bit about my hair. (*straight, medium strand thickness, normal to high density, oily scalp (gets oily anywhere between 24-36hrs sometimes it varies after washing, regardless of shampoo used, but* ***basically I can't go without washing my hair every day or every 2 days max****) - I have PCOS so my scalp has slight thinning at the crown. High androgens.*\n\nNow, I'm sick, like actually sick of seeing everywhere that oily scalps should avoid silicones in their **shampoos** at all costs as it clogs scalp, causes hair-loss, makes hair greasy, builds up etc etc, don't use this, don't use that blah blah blah (mind you I've used shampoo with silicones all my life and never had a reaction, hair's beautiful below waist length) \\~ should just stop washing my hair yeah?? smh\n\nMy current shampoo is formulated for all hair types and has the **following ingredients:** \"*Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Dimethiconol, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Cannabis Satvia Seed Oil (Hemp Oil), Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract (Hibiscus Flower), PEG-45M, Carbomer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cocamide MEA, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, TEA-Sulfate, Glycol Distearate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Mica, Titanium Dioxide.\"*  \n\n\nAs you can see dimethiconol is in the shampoo with SLES, but even if a shampoo works well for me, I get paranoid if it's not clear, like I know it sounds stupid but it's taken a huge toll on me, as I'm taking a holistic approach to managing PCOS, and I love my hair so I've been experimenting and trying out different shampoos, as I can't stick with one due to all the advice about \"don't use this, don't use that\" despite a shampoo feeling good on hair, I feel depressed as it feels like oh there's dimethiconol in my shampoo it's probs secretly damaging my hair and I don't know about it.   \n\n\n**Can someone,** *who hasn't graduated from tiktok university,* **please please tell me, are silicones really that bad for oily scalps??**  especially if it's in a shampoo that has SLES in it? how do silicones stick to **scalp** and lead to buildup? doesn't buildup happen if you don't wash your hair?  in that case anything and everything can build up? Why can't I find specific information about dimethiconol vs dimethicone, my conditioner has both dimethicone and amodimethicone, and no please don't stick a link from labmuffin talking about silicones, I've seen it, she doesn't go through it in the detail I'm looking for, and ps she talks about conditioners, I don't care about conditioners, as my **hair is not oily**, but sometimes dull, lifeless, and limp, sometimes frizzy, but **my scalp is oily.**  And **why and how does dimethiconol stick to hair and lead to buildup if the shampoo has SLES in it which is designed to cleanse and thus gets rid of the dimethiconol? if so, why is it used in shampoos then? and if it's getting cleansed, why would it buildup??**  \n\n\nI like washing my hair regularly, I don't believe in hair training or all that bullcrap, as sebum production is genetic and other factors play roles such as certain conditions and etc ie: PCOS. What bothers me is that people say \"shampoos for oily scalp's too stripping, shampoos for dry hair is too moisturising\" so isn't it better to use a hydrating shampoo that's formulated for all hair types that cleanses and also hydrates and provides a balance??  \n\n\nCongrats for making it to the end...🙏🏽",

        "body": "People say a lot of things about hair products, and most of them are not scientists who have truly studied it and how something affects anyone's hair but their own. \n\nInstead of listening to what other people say about how a shampoo might behave in your hair, your own experience of how the shampoo works for you is the best source of information.  It sounds like the shampoo you're using now works well for you.  If you're not experiencing scalp issues or noticing a lot of buildup on your scalp, then you're good.\n\nI know you've already seen at least one Labmuffin video that didn't specifically address dimethiconol, but have you seen [this older video she did](https://youtu.be/yzM4pCKXZ5Y?si=4XzJ3dq_VbQhYP1H) about silicones in skincare as well as haircare products?  I ask because she specifically addresses the concern of silicone buildup on the skin.  She talks about how it doesn't create an impenetrable coating in the skin, and even if it did, it would come off eventually as the outermost dead skin cells naturally are shed.  If you're really concerned about scalp buildup specifically, you can integrate a scalp exfoliant into your haircare routine to help it shed those dead skin cells.  Salicylic acid is great for oily scalps because it's lipophilic.\n\nAccording to [this sub's own guide on silicones](https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/), dimethiconol specifically is in Group 2, so it's relatively easy to wash out with shampoo.  I really don't think you have anything to worry about.  But if you're still worried, you could try writing to her directly; she loves to geek out about silicones specifically so I bet she would be willing to answer your question.  You could also try writing to [The Beauty Brains](http://thebeautybrains.com/), it's two cosmetic chemists who answer questions like this on their podcast.",

        "body": "It’s true that silicones can cause build up and weigh hair down over-time since they’re a polymer (plastic/rubber hybrid) that coats the hair in a similar way that oils do making it smooth and soft. I don’t know too much about the science but it can still be formulated to cleanse while coating the hairs to become smooth but will essentially cause build up. \n\nand yes typically those with oilier scalps are cautioned to avoid because of how heavy it can be. \n\nbut everyone’s hair and scalp is different. \n\nso if your hair and scalp are totally fine with the added silicone in your shampoo, then there’s no reason to eliminate it.  \n\nIf there is build up, it can easily be remedied by using a clarifying shampoo -some people like an apple cider vinegar rinse -once a week or how ever often you feel you need it which is what most people should be doing anyhow. Sadly I feel like not everyone knows this because companies don’t advertise clarifying products the same way we see hair smoothing,  anti-frizz, and even dandruff products being marketed.  Probably because it’s  the one product that could eliminate most scalp issues lol. But we’re just taught how to remedy one problem and make our hair look nice but no one talks about scalp care. \n\nI too have an oily scalp. I avoided shampoos and conditioners with silicones (and sulfates) for a while. But lately I’ve become serious about growing out my hair and found that some people use silicone to achieve healthy hair. \n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve used a shampoo with silicones but I can remember that most of them just weighed my hair down and made my scalp more oily or irritated so i just don’t buy it. As for now, I personally prefer a sulfate free/silicone free clarifying shampoo that I’ve found during my “free of all things bad” phase. And yes it’s clarifying but the one I’m using - I don’t find it to be harsh or stripping at all and it’s the only shampoo i like that makes my hair feel clean and light and most importantly keeps my scalp from getting oily within a day.  i still need to wash every other day but my scalp just feels a lot more comfortable with that shampoo. \n\nI’ve also tried other brands of shampoos that were sulfate and silicone free yet they were making my scalp oily and weighing my hair down?! Sooo…?!?!\n\nBut I do now use a  conditioner containing silicone and it’s been awesome. Before, I had been using conditioners without silicones and all the “nasties” yet those kinds never helped to truly condition or hydrate my hair and just made the ends of my hair a tangled mess. \n\nMy hair feels and looks healthier than it has in the past with my current regimen. \n\nSo use whatever you feel is working for you and what your scalp and hair is feeling comfortable with. Everyone’s scalp is different. Just keep a clarifying shampoo or a clarifying rinse on hand!",

        "body": "I'll add that it's a fair question regarding why silicones wouldn't be broken down by the surfactants in a shampoo, what function do they serve.  It depends of course on the formulation, but there is a technology that was developed in the 1980's to create 2-in-1 shampoo+conditioners by essentially suspending silicones in such a way that it will deposit on hair from a shampoo while it’s being rinsed.  Pantene later applied this technology in their shampoos without calling them a 2-in-1, and now many shampoos use this technology to add some conditioning to the hair even before a conditioner is used.\n\nIt's explained simply here: [https://thebeautybrains.com/2015/11/if-pantene-is-so-good-why-isnt-it-sold-in-salons-episode-108/](https://thebeautybrains.com/2015/11/if-pantene-is-so-good-why-isnt-it-sold-in-salons-episode-108/)\n\nand in more detail here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/lmbrwj/how\\_does\\_dimethicone\\_behave\\_in\\_a\\_sodium\\_laureth/](https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/lmbrwj/how_does_dimethicone_behave_in_a_sodium_laureth/)\n\nApparently guar is often used to create this suspension of the silicone; note that your shampoo contains Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride.",

Fyi, i use oil control shampoos as a counter for excessive sebum.\n\n**To start off i've noticed that some specific shampoos, f.e some H&S ones, with similar ingredients in them, tend to be more aggrevvating towards rosacea and they usually leave a flared up feeling post wash that can last, depending on how serious your rosacea is. However, they tend to be more effective towards acne (if you also have that) and dandruff.**\n\n* *Example 1-> Product: Head & Shoulders Deep Cleanse For Oily Scalp*\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Parfum, Piroctone Olamine, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-10, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Limonene, Sodium Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Citrus Limon Fruit Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, CI 42090*\n\n**Other shampoos like the le petit marseillais one** **(or gen ones that are more eco) with very different ingredients in it and missing the most well known trigger ingredients, is more friendly towards rosacea. I did notice that, post using it, my hair look more thin, shedding and thats a bit worrying. (placebo?!)**\n\n*Example 2->Product: Le Petit Marseillais w/ Thyme and White Clay*\n\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Thymus Vulgaris Extract, Kaolin, Polyquaternium-10, Glycol Distearate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n**P.S: Ingredients that can trigger rosacea flare ups, quoting AAD:**\n\n* *Alcohol*\n* *Camphor*\n* *Fragrance*\n* *Glycolic acid*\n* *Lactic acid*\n* *Menthol*\n* *Sodium lauryl sulfate (often found in shampoos)*\n* *Urea*\n\nThere's also shampoos that belong to an in between category, having slightly different ingredients in them, but i do notice that, thus far, none of them are as friendly as an eco shampoo which doesn't have the same ingredients as a H&S one, or has them in a very low percent.\n\nThis makes sense as ingredients that trigger rosacea when applied to the face straight away, can be effective when applying them to your hair/scalp which is a continuation of your face contact area. You can mitigate the consequences by avoiding shampoo run down your face/wash well post shampoo etc...\n\nYou can drop your recommendations below as well as the ingredients involved in the products you use.",

Sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate is not a sulfate, so if your goal is just to go sulfate free for environmental reasons or what have you, this would be acceptable. However, it is still a pretty strong surfactant meaning this will still be a shampoo with lots of foam/lather, I would think it would still disrupt your hair’s natural oil production and still has the same potentially irritating/drying effect. So if your goal is to not strip your hair and have more natural oil production, I probably wouldn’t go with this one. \n\nHere’s a good webpage- https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/ingredients/what-is-sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate-hi\n\nEdit: grammer",

However, Pantene shampoo contains several harsh chemicals—including sulfates and benzyl alcohol—that can lead to damaged hair and may even cause hair loss in some people.\n\nSo is Pantene good for your hair?\n\nLet’s look at what kind of shampoo is best for healthy hair and which harmful chemicals you should avoid to prevent scalp irritation and hair breakage. \n\n📷\n\n## How bad is Pantene for your hair?\n\nPantene hair care products may work for some people, but they contain several potentially harmful ingredients that can cause significant hair damage and have been linked to various skin conditions, including dandruff, dermatitis, and acne. \n\nHow bad Pantene is for your hair depends on your particular type of hair, your hair care routine, and whether you have colored or chemically treated hair. \n\nWhile Pantene products are marketed as beneficial for all hair types, the harsh chemicals in Pantene’s shampoos aren't suitable for fine hair, curly and textured hair, or color-treated hair.\n\nMany Pantene shampoos contain silicone which coats your hair shafts to make the hair appear shiny and smooth. However, silicone can build up and lead to clogged hair follicles, [a common cause of hair loss](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-common-cause-of-hair-loss) and scalp skin issues.  \n\n\nOther problematic ingredients in Pantene products are sulfates, including sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. These synthetic compounds are used as foaming agents and strip your hair and scalp of natural oils, which can cause dry, brittle hair that’s prone to breakage. \n\nSome people reported that using Pantene made their hair fall out and that switching to sulfate-free shampoo improved hair loss.  \n\n### Pantene ingredient breakdown\n\nPantene shampoo and conditioner ingredients can vary depending on the product. However, according to Pantene's [website](https://pantene.com/en-us/ingredients/our-essential-ingredients), there are common ingredients found in most of their shampoos. \n\nHere is a breakdown of some of the most common Pantene shampoo ingredients: \n\n* **Sodium lauryl sulfate** and **sodium laureth sulfate** in Pantene are surfactants that remove dirt and oils.\n* **Cocamidopropyl betaine** is another surfactant that helps to create a rich lather and improve the cleansing ability of the shampoo.\n* **Sodium benzoate** helps extend the product's shelf life and maintain its effectiveness over time.\n* **Benzyl alcoho**l acts as a solvent and helps prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi.\n* **Dimethicone** is a type of silicone that coats the hair shafts to achieve smooth and frizz-free hair.\n* **Methylchloroisothiazolinone** and other synthetic preservatives prevent microbial overgrowth and stabilize the texture of the shampoo.\n* **Artificial fragrances and dyes** are typically used in Pantene products to achieve a pleasant smell and color. \n* **Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride** is often found in Pantene conditioners and helps detangle the hair and improve its manageability.\n* **Tetrasodium EDTA** and other synthetic chelating agents prevent shampoos from separating and help to evenly spread the product.\n* **Cocamide MEA** is a synthetic compound that thickens shampoo and improves its texture.  \n\n\n📷\n\n## Is Pantene dangerous to use?\n\nUsing Pantene regularly has been linked to damaged hair and accelerated hair loss, and may cause allergic reactions and increase your risk of hormonal imbalances and cancer.  \n\nAlthough not all Pantene products contain parabens, some shampoos still include these harmful synthetic preservatives. \n\nParabens are linked to a range of health issues due to their potential to disrupt estrogen levels which can cause [hormonal imbalance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/hormone-imbalance-signs-causes-solutions), fertility issues, and weight gain—and they may even contribute to the development of breast cancer.\n\nIn fact, paraben exposure from shampoos may pose significantly more health issues than dietary intake of these preservatives. \n\n“*The topical application of paraben-containing products more likely contributes to the systemic paraben concentration than their oral intake due to the rapid intestinal and hepatic metabolism,”* states a group of toxicologists that published this [study ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618656/)in the *International Journal of Molecular Science*.\n\nIn addition, a [report ](https://www.safecosmetics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Not-Too-Pretty.pdf)published by *The Environmental Working Group* found phthalates in several Pantene hair care products. Phthalates are a group of chemicals that can cause an imbalance in sex hormone levels and have been linked to birth defects, [infertility](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-overcome-infertility), and reduced sperm count. \n\nIf you have been using shampoos containing parabens and phthalates and are worried about your health, it’s essential to consult with a healthcare provider to discuss any potential medical concerns.\n\n📷\n\n## What kind of shampoo is best for your hair?\n\nTo find the best shampoo for your hair, it’s essential that you understand your hair type and scalp condition. \n\nHere are three things to consider when choosing a [shampoo to restore damaged hair](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-shampoo-really-restore-damaged-hair).\n\n**1. Hair type** \n\nIf you tend to have [oily hair](https://www.drberg.com/blog/nutrient-deficiencies-in-dry-or-oily-hair), you may benefit from a gentle clarifying shampoo that helps to remove excess oil and buildup. \n\nIf your hair is dry and brittle, choose a shampoo with natural argan oil that hydrates and nourishes your hair strands.\n\n### 2. Scalp health\n\nA healthy scalp is a foundation for beautiful hair. If you have sensitive skin, a shampoo containing tea tree oil and [aloe vera](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-aloe-vera) can soothe an irritated scalp and reduce flakes and dandruff. \n\nA [review ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4452276/)published in *the Journal of BioMed Research International* confirms that aloe vera has potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties and can significantly reduce [dandruff](https://www.drberg.com/blog/best-remedies-for-dandruff)[.](https://www.drberg.com/blog/best-remedies-for-dandruff) \n\n### 3. Avoid harsh chemicals \n\nSynthetic ingredients tend to remove the natural oils on your scalp, which causes dull hair that’s prone to damage and split ends. \n\nSulfates, parabens, and benzyl alcohol, are bad for your hair. These harsh chemicals may cause dry and brittle hair, trigger skin irritation and allergies, and slow down hair growth. \n\n## How to shop for a shampoo with clean ingredients\n\nTo promote healthy and strong hair, choose a sulfate-free and paraben-free shampoo that doesn’t contain phthalates, silicone, or alcohol.\n\nLook for products with natural and organic ingredients such as plant extracts, essential oils, and botanicals that nourish your scalp and hydrate your hair. \n\nIt’s also important to read product labels. Opt for a shampoo with a short and simple ingredient list, and avoid those with long lists of unfamiliar chemical names.\n\nLast but not least, research the brand, look for statements such as cruelty-free and environmentally friendly, and check for certifications such as organic and USA GMP-certified manufacturing. \n\n📷\n\n## Could your scalp benefit from biotin shampoo?\n\nUsing the wrong shampoo can irritate your scalp and leave your hair frizzy and tangled. And, what’s more, shampoos containing parabens and sulfates may even harm your health.  \n\nTo achieve healthier hair, it’s important to support strong hair follicles and nourish the scalp. \n\nUnfortunately, many shampoos contain harsh chemicals that strip natural oils from the skin, which can cause dull hair that's hard to manage, slow growth rate, and hair loss.  \n\nWhile healthy hair growth relies on a wide range of nutrients, biotin is particularly important for stimulating the formation of new hair shafts and regulating normal hair follicle function.  \n\n*“Biotin is an essential nutrient that’s important to maintain the health of your scalp and hair,”* says Dr. Berg. “*Biotin deficiency can result in brittle and thinning hair and has been linked to hair loss.”*  \n\nWhile biotin is found in many foods, it’s a heat-sensitive nutrient that quickly degrades during cooking, leaving you at risk of biotin deficiency. \n\nStress, alcohol, and certain medications—including antacids, antibiotics, and cholesterol-lowering drugs—deplete biotin and may contribute to dry scalp skin and damaged hair that’s difficult to manage.   \n\nA combination of biotin deficiency and using the wrong shampoo can significantly impact the health of your hair follicles, and replenishing biotin should be the first step to revitalizing your hair.\n\nUsing a biotin shampoo may help:\n\n* Strengthen hair \n* Promote hair growth\n* Increase shine and smoothness\n* Nourish hair follicles \n* Reduce hair loss and thinning\n\nMost shampoos don’t contain biotin and are made with cheap synthetic ingredients that don’t hydrate and nourish your hair.\n\nThat’s why we designed our own shampoo infused with biotin and powerful hair-nourishing oils. If you’re looking for a premium-quality shampoo, you need to check out this product.\n\nWe designed Dr. Berg Biotin Shampoo to cleanse, hydrate, replenish, and promote soft and healthy hair—from roots to ends.\n\nIt not only contains highly-concentrated biotin, but it’s also infused with invigorating botanicals, rejuvenating essential oils, and enriching aloe vera.\n\nDr. Berg Biotin Shampoo is also packed with nutrient-rich argan oil that penetrates deep into hair shafts and replenishes your hair with essential vitamins and minerals.\n\n📷\n\n## A gentle and high-performing shampoo made for everyday use  \n\nDr. Berg Biotin Shampoo takes a far more gentle and nourishing approach to hair care compared to conventional shampoo brands.\n\nOur unique formula cleanses and hydrates without harsh chemicals that strip your scalp's natural oils, making Biotin Shampoo perfect for everyday use and suitable for all hair types.\n\nDr. Berg Biotin Shampoo is sulfate-free, silicone-free, and paraben-free and won’t leave residues or product buildup.

Is Pantene shampoo safe to use?\n\nPantene products contain sulfates, benzyl alcohol, and synthetic preservatives. These harsh chemicals can damage your hair and irritate your scalp and hair follicles which can cause hair loss and thinning.\n\nSome Pantene products also contain parabens and phthalates, which can penetrate the skin and disrupt hormone balance which has been linked to fertility issues, weight gain, and congenital disabilities.  \n\n### 2. What are the disadvantages of Pantene shampoo?\n\nPantene shampoos are made with low-quality synthetic ingredients that can strip the natural oils from your hair and scalp, leaving you with dry and frizzy hair that isn’t easy to manage.\n\nPantene also contains potentially harmful chemicals that can interfere with hormonal balance, cause skin irritation and acne, and disrupt normal hair follicle function.  \n\n### 3. What type of hair is Pantene good for?\n\nWhile Pantene shampoo works for some people, it contains harsh chemicals that may not be suitable for curly or fine hair, textured hair, and color-treated hair. \n\n### 4. Is Pantene bad for the environment?\n\nPantene contains tetrasodium EDTA which has been found to have negative environmental impacts, particularly when it enters the water supply. \n\nTetrasodium EDTA binds to heavy metals and prevents their breakdown, which can lead to pollution and is believed to be harmful to organisms in aquatic environments.  \n\n### 5. Does Pantene have silicone and parabens?\n\nYes, some Pantene products contain silicone and parabens. \n\n### 6. Does Dr. Berg Biotin Shampoo contain sulfate?\n\nNo, Dr. Berg Biotin Shampoo is a sulfate-free formula packed with biotin, aloe vera, and nutrient-rich argan oil that penetrates deep into hair shafts and keeps your hair healthy.",

I’d try balancing it out if too many of your products have too much protein in it, it could over dry your hair (if you’re not protein sensitive). \n\nIf you know you’re not protein sensitive I would try going for a routine like this = Moisture shampoo (no protein), protein conditioner (Manuka honey conditioner), protein curl cream, moisture gel, or something of a sort like that.  more moisture and just a little bit of protein is ideal for people with non protein sensitive hair. \n\nShea moisture’s low porosity line has all protein free products as well as Maui moisture which cheaper than Shea moisture but works just as good especially with the moisture.

    "body": "Hi, /r/curlyhair!  Long time lurker, first time poster!  I got these two products as a Christmas gift and used them for a few months before I decided to buckle down and write a review.  Here goes, please feel free to ask any questions!  \n\n**Basic Info** \n\nLeonor Greyl is a luxury natural hair care line.  I personally am a sucker for high-end products so I had to try these.  The shampoo/conditioners I usually use are the Cristalliste line from Kerastase (the pink bottles).  My hair is naturally 3B but I flat iron 1-2 times a week at most and rock it curly otherwise.  \n\nLeonor Greyl has a whole line of different products but the two I will be reviewing are the **Shampooing Reviviscence – Deep Repairing Shampoo for Damaged Hair and the Masque Orchidee — Conditioning Mask for Thick, Dry Hair**\n \n**Shampoo info:** Deep repairing shampoo for dehydrated, colored, damaged and brittle hair. This luxurious shampoo reconditions and restructures the most damaged hair, thus regaining strength and vitality, manageability, shine and softness.\n\n**Mask info:** Silk proteins, vegetal ceramids and oils work together to smooth, detangle, protect and restructure hair fiber. Leaves hair soft and manageable.\n\n\n**Ingredients** (as listed on product):\n\n**Shampoo:** Aqua, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-40 Glyceryl Cocoate, Sodium Coceth sulphate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl dimethylaminohydroxypropyl hydrolysed collagen, Hydrolysed Quinoa, Limonium latifolium, Fucus Vesiculosus Extract, Hydrolysed Silk, Bambusa vulgaris Extract, Myristamine Oxide, Polyquaternium-47, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-33, Quaternium-91, Cetrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-15 Cocopolyamine, Lauryl Dimethyl Amine Oxide, Parfum (Fragrance), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Cereus Grandiflorus (Cactus) Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Lactic Acid, Guar, droxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Daucus Carota Extract, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Limonene, Linalool, Geraniol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional\n\n**Mask:** Aqua, Methylheptyl Isostearate, Adipic Acid/Diethylene Glycol/Glycerin Crosspolymer, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamide MEA, Buxus Chinesis Seed Oil, PEG-15 Cocopolyamine, Orchis Maculata Flower Extract, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Sericin, Parfum (Fragrance), Ceteareth-33, Jojoba Wax PEG-120 Esters, Butyrospermum Parkii, Lauryl Dimethyl Amine Oxide,\nElaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, Hydrolysed Silk, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Triticum Vulgare,\nTrietanolamine, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Price**\n\nSuggested retail for the shampoo is $67 (!) and the mask is $62.  Both are 200 mL (6.8 oz).  I've seen it online on Amazon for cheaper though.  Good thing this was a gift!  \n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nStore retailers are available on Leonor Greyl's website but there are several online retailers that sell this, such as Amazon, Doobop, etc.  \n\n**How to Use**\n\nFor the shampoo, you are supposed to lather and leave it in your hair for 5-minutes before rinsing out.  The mask can be used like a regular conditioner or you can leave it in your hair for 5-minutes if you want to do light conditioning, or 20-minutes for a deep treatment.\n\n**Pros**\n\nAfter the first month or so of using it once a week I noticed a bit of a difference.  My hair felt soft after I washed with these products and it didn't feel stripped.  The shampoo lathers pretty well and the mask spreads really nicely on my hair.  It's like butter.  Curls looked more well-defined.  \n\n**Cons**\n\nThe price.  The smell.  Oh dear lord, the shampoo smells like old ladies.  Consistency of the shampoo is really weird, too.  Maybe I got a bad bottle but it was like some solid stuff mixed in with liquid stuff.  I have to shake the bottle when I get it out and [this](http://i.imgur.com/mEnHADU.jpg) was what it looks like.  The bottle also opens from the bottom so as soon as I opened it the first few times the flood gates opened and all this watery shampoo poured out that I didn't need.  The mask doesn't smell as strongly as the shampoo does but it's pretty pricey, too.\n\n**Overall**\n\nIn my opinion these products were not worth the money.  Considering the price, the amount of product I got, and its performance, I'd rather spend my money on something else.  Without a doubt, these products would be good as a step up from using something like, say, from the drugstore.  The products I was using already were pretty high-end to begin with so it was like a lateral (or dare I say a step down) shift for me.  \n\nIf you're looking to step up from drugstore stuff then check out Ouidad.  If you're using mid-range stuff and are in the market for something HE then go with Kerastase.  \n\nThat being said, don't be discouraged just because of my review!  They have a sampler set on their website you can try if you feel so inclined.  \n\nI really wanted to like these products but I just can't.  Very disappointing but I'm glad I was able to try them.

If you’re trying to recreate that effect, I’d look for a lightweight clarifying shampoo like: Redken Amino Mint Scalp Shampoo, Kenra Clarifying Shampoo, or Pureology Clarify Shampoo.\n\nThen for conditioner, you need a silicone-containing conditioner that also includes panthenol, hydrolyzed proteins, and a polyquaternium or two for slip.

Look at a betaine (CAPB) or decyl glucocide as a possible boost. Overall surfactant \"dry weight\" target would be 15 - 20% for a premium shampoo. If you  want a REALLY foamy product consider Polyquaternium 50 @ 0.5% as a foam booster.\n\nI would advise against xanthan/cationic guar - they don't do the best job as thickening agent in anionic systems and can feel a bit \"slimey\".  Somebody else suggested HEC and I would second that (try about 0.5% - 1% of HEC 50000 predispersed in glycerol and added after your surfactants are in the system). Spin until cl;ear.\n\nDepending on pH target, citric acid (down) or sodium citrate (up) to adjust is fine.\n\nKeep your essential oils below 0.5% - they will supress foam and cloud your product at higher levels.\n\nPreservative systems - your choice, but recognise that many are pH limited and don't work against all bugs. A mix of phenoxyethanol and potassium sorbate may work, but I'f go for DMDM hydantoin for general use.",

I would wash every day and never (or rarely) used conditioner.

And I have been realizing my itchy scalp and dry flakes can be connected to this and sodium lauryl sulfate. Also, I had tried a nourishing shampoo loaded with proteins in it and I'm thinking that could have contributed a lot as well, bc I seem to have all the symptoms of protein sensitive hair (dry, rough, straw like after using it).\n\nAnyway back to now, I have started using pantene essential botanicals volumizing shampoo. It seems ok, and my itchy/dry scalp seems to be reduced significantly. I haven't used it long enough to tell if it will change my texture, but will it have a positive impact on my poor hair? the primary detergent is Sodium laureth sulfate which I read is better, and I can't tell if there are any proteins - does histidine count?

A lot of companies will put these gum or gum derived components or other similar ingredients in their products, typically for curly or textured hair. From my own experience, (I have curly hair medium texture)… I have been looking for something cleansing but also won’t strip my hair. I found INNERSENSE brand just yesterday though and have heard really good things…And I am going to try their clarity hair bath which DOES seem to contain this ingredient but claims to be hypoallergenic as it does not contain any fragrance, essential oils/other irritants. \nWondering if this will make a difference.. \nThis company also makes other products that may be worth looking into however I do not know if they have co washes",

I've only recently started using a hair mask on top of my regular (shampoo + conditioner and/or diluted apple cider vinegar) routine once a week.
