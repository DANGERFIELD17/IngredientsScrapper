While potassium does react with the oxygen in air, the various oxides that can possibly form will react with excess potassium to become less oxidized (ie, the superoxide becomes the oxide), and they will react with moisture in the jar to become KOH. Any lumps of metal in that jar are going to be coated in a layer of potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate. That is going to be the hazard: It might not react rapidly because its surface is passivated, but once that layer is removed you'll have fresh metal exposed, which is much more reactive than sodium.\n\nOf course, EH&S will likely claim that potassium is a super serious peroxide former and must be disposed of within 3 months. Well, my EH&S department also says that ethanol has a twelve month shelf life because it forms peroxides... So use your noggin before you blindly follow EH&S.",

I’m convinced that it’s going to run well into >$1 territory in April. I may post small updates when the big catalysts start rolling in next month.\n\n**Full disclosure: I own 50,000 shares, now at an average of 0.11.** I obviously have a vested interest in this stock, so please do your DD and do not treat this as financial advice. I also welcome your thoughts and criticisms in the comments. I don’t know how else to make it clear that this is not a pump and dump, but I hope you get a sense for that as you read this post. I have included some red flags at the end.\n\n**There are sources at the end of this DD which cover all the datapoints I quote in the post**, should you wish to investigate further, as well as a list of other good DDs on this company. I have adopted some of the research in these DDs in making this (e.g., u/Manlikecheese, u/NightcoreRo, u/Silly_hat7720).\n\n# 2.

The company is currently trading as RSSV while it waits for FINRA to approve an update to the ticker. RSSV currently has 3 portfolio companies, with more on the way. The existing portfolio companies are below (more detail on their financials further on):\n\n* **Tieshan Oil:** a Beijing-based supplier of refined petrochemicals products (e.g., methyl tert-butyl ether, paraffin oil, petrolatum liquid). The company was founded in 2005, with a long-term client base comprising licensed Chinese gasoline operators. It does \\~$30m in revenue per year\n* **Admall:** a Malaysia-based B2C eCommerce platform focusing on health and wellness, selling products in SE Asia, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea\n* **Wandi Mine:** a mine containing 24m tons of clean, low-sulfur thermal coal. It was acquired for stock in 2020 by RSSV, but the details of the transaction are yet to be confirmed (more on this below). 80-90% of the coal is attainable, and it is all pre-sold to the Chinese government, meaning there is no wasted production. In 2017, this mine was valued at >$1bn USD (lifetime)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wandi Mine - exact google maps co-ords are 34.137889, 113.161561](https://preview.redd.it/3a8c5usqrnl61.png?width=349&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66ff59af5447f4b15ba43b45a9cd743942d3f7a)\n\n# 3. Where we are, and how we got here\n\n**RSSV is currently trading at $0.08**, and has oscillated between $0.08 and $0.2 over the last 6 months. In late 2019, the stock was trading at $1-3, but fell rapidly as the onset of COVID-19 in China put a hold on Tieshan Oil’s revenues. Since then, Tieshan Oil revenues have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, but – remarkably – the stock price has not.\n\nNote: The stock price has oscillated somewhat in the last 6 months, on the anticipation of news regarding the Wandi Coal mine. Although we are still waiting, it’s likely that we will hear by the first week of April (in the RSSV annual report – more on why I think this below). **I believe these oscillations up to $0.2 are still far, far below the fair value of this stock, which is why they do not concern me.**\n\nLooking back a bit further, you’ll see that RSSV previously traded at a much higher price. From 2017 to 2019, this was between $20 and $30. The current management team took control of the company in 2018, and issued a 1:100 split in 2019. They are now assuming an acquisitive strategy, having reduced their liabilities/debt from $34m to $2.5m in 2019/20. Assets are at $12.5m - so the balance sheet is positive.\n\n# 4. RSSV is undervalued based on existing financials alone\n\nAs of March 5th, RSSV’s market cap is USD $10m. **Yes, $10m**. That’s 128m outstanding shares at a $0.079 price per share. Based on current performance alone, that’s low. **In fact, the market cap is lower than the assets on the balance sheet.** ($10m vs. $12.5m)\n\n**In 2019, Tieshan Oil did $30m in revenues and $0.6m in gross profit, and in 2018 it did $37m in revenues and $1.4m in gross profit**. The difference between these years corresponds to the higher oil price (>$70) in 2018. Although TO was hit hard by COVID, **its recovery is complete** – it generated more revenue in Q3 2020 ($4.8m) than Q3 2019 ($3.2m) – and the rising oil prices will work in its favour. Admall is less of a money spinner, bringing in $0.6m revenues and $0.1m in gross profit.\n\nSo, **in an ordinary year, RSSV’s current subsidiaries should do around $30-35m in revenues and around $1m in profits**. It was valued at \\~$1.50 a share pre-COVID, and even though its financials are bouncing back post-COVID, that is not reflected in the current stock price.\n\n# 5. Upcoming catalysts\n\n**Wandi Mine**\n\n* We are expecting to see confirmation of the $1.2bn Wandi Mine transaction in the RSSV annual SEC report (due 31 March), or soon after. It is already listed as a portfolio company on the RSSV website.\n* As stated, **the mine was purchased for stock on Feb 24 2020, with 60m of RSSV’s shares transferred to the owner of the Wandi Mine, at a value of $1.50**. In essence, the owner of the Wandi Mine sold it in return for 49% of the shares in RSSV, who will then contract out the extraction of the coal using equipment which is already on site. The Wandi owner made this agreement when RSSV was trading at $0.5, meaning that he must have confidence in the fact the stock was at least 3x undervalued, even back then. **If RSSV reaches the $1.5 valuation at which the Wandi deal was made, that makes it 19x undervalued at current prices.**\n* All that is left is for the transaction to close. In Feb 2020, RSSV estimated that this would take one year (i.e., it should be happening right now). To add to my confidence that this will happen, DS Chang (RSSV CEO) is listed as a director of the Wandi Mine, and there was a further change in Wandi Directors in November 2020 (presumably to RSSV management but this was not disclosed).\n* The Wandi financials are very attractive: it has 24m of clean coal, of which \\~19m is extractable and all is pre-sold to the Chinese government. **RSSV has determined an initial production scope of 0.9m tons of coal a year, and taking a coal price of $65/ton, this would generate revenues of USD $58.5m per year.** As the annual production scope increases with extraction, annual revenues are likely to be substantially higher than this in the future.\n\n**99technologies:**\n\n* RSSV has an acquisition agreement in place for 99technologies, **a Swiss disinfectants company which owns 27 patents and was expected to generate $14m in 2021 revenues**. We are also expecting to hear news on this acquisition in the annual report. RSSV has an acquisition agreement in place with another disinfectant company in China – Culmination Radiant – to be finalised as a complementary acquisition to 99technologies. For some bullish evidence: in **August 2020, RSSV formed a subsidiary – PRX Biomed – to enable the distribution of infection control products in the USA**. Sounds a lot like what 99technologies are selling, right?\n\n**Ticker and name change:**\n\n* This sounds like a small thing but I’ve seen a lot of questions about the use of the old ticker (i.e., what is Resort Savers? What does oil have to do with resorts?) and I believe that this lack of clarity reduces investor confidence. When FINRA changes the ticker, the stock will seem more trustworthy.\n\nIn summary, we are looking at $30m in revenue from Tieshan Oil, $60m from Wandi Mine, and potentially $14m from 99technologies. **That’s up to $100m in revenues – for a stock with a $10m market cap. I surely cannot be the only one who sees that and thinks that this is crazily undervalued.**\n\n# 6. The share structure is excellent\n\nAs mentioned above, there’s a comparatively small float of 128m shares outstanding, with **\\~40% of shares owned by the CEO, CFO and COO as of last year’s annual report.** **DS Chang, the CEO, was subsequently granted an additional 16m shares in June.** It’s encouraging to see that the management team is heavily invested.\n\n# 7. The CEO is experienced, and has a long-term relationship with the Wandi Mine\n\nDS Chang, the CEO, has 25 years of experience in corporate finance, and was formerly the Vice-Chairman for SGCI, a French international financial group ([https://www.sgcifinance.com/](https://www.sgcifinance.com/))\n\n**DS Chang also has a long-term relationship with Wandi Mine – in 2018 via SGCI, he was tasked with bringing it public on the CSE** (Cyprus Stock Exchange) which did not work out – which is now why he is bringing it public via RSSV (i.e., purchasing it for equity).\n\nLast thing to mention is that Chang’s firm, SGCI, was hired to help RSSV on its journey towards uplisting to NASDAQ back in 2018. Now Chang is the CEO of RSSV, he’s taken that mission on properly.\n\n# 8. Red flags\n\n**The biggest red flag is the lack of PR** – i.e., in a similar vein to companies like TLSS, the management team only seems to issue PR when it also has to make an SEC filing. This is in equal parts frustrating and concerning, but I believe it can be attributable to two things.\n\nFirstly, it’s an Asian investment holdings company – and culturally, it could be that these companies are more focused on turning a profit than they are in publicity. Compared to ALPP, for example, which has an incredible PR team and which I am also invested in, RSSV puts out no PR for months at a time, even when it has been profitable over the last couple of years.\n\nSecondly, the deals on which we are waiting are only now reaching the point where we would expect disclosure. **The CEO has also responded personally to a number of emails stating that he is working on some PR at the moment, and that he will release more in the year ahead.** On the other hand, that is indeed what you would expect him to say.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the lack of PR really pisses me off. But I think it will improve following this month’s annual report, and even without any PR I still think RSSV is undervalued.\n\nAnother red flag is that it’s hard to find information on the company’s CFO, Lucy Liu, online. The RSSV website states that she has worked very closely with the Chinese government, which leads me to believe she might be using a Chinese name online rather than the anglicized ‘Lucy’. But if anyone finds more info on this, please let me know.\n\n# 9. Conclusion\n\n**Without any acquisitions, I believe RSSV should be trading at $1+** and will do so with its next annual report regardless of the Wandi mine.\n\n**With the acquisition of the Wandi mine, it should easily be trading in the multiple dollars**. I expect this to occur following the annual report or soon after, given some of the evidence on the Wandi transaction noted above.\n\n# 10.

Recently i found [this guide], and it seems the inclusion of Paraffin Oil was a huge gamechanger. I have found my results different from that post a lot. I'm not sure if that is due to different supplies, or something in my process. But for instance, I have found I use (by weight) a higher ratio of Perc than wax. I'm continuing to run tests now that this lamp is flowing so beautifully. I want to modulate the amount of paraffin oil, perc, and take detailed notes on exactly how much of a difference each makes to the overall look and flow of the lava. For instance, how different does a light wax with water react versus a heavy wax and dense liquid. Or a wax with a lower melting point and weaker bulb, versus higher melting point and hotter bulb. Hopefully I can provide more updates, and my own take on a custom wax guide in the coming months!\n\nI do have some of my own critiques for this lamp. I think I used too much dye, because the Lava is a bit too opaque and doesn't capture the light as well as it did before adding the dye (the red used to glow spectacularly before I got trigger happy with the dye). The bubbles also fall a bit too slowly for my liking, and I am open to suggestions on how to speed up the flow. I'm thinking it needs a few drops of Surf to break up the lava into smaller blobs. I also need to release some of the liquid, as the lava is reaching to far into the neck of the bottle and getting stuck. Something I have also noticed is that the longer it runs, the more tiny bubbles of wax form. Pretty much every time a blob of wax splits, it leaves behind 2-3 tiny bubbles. Any insight into how to avoid that is also appreciated it. \n\nThe lamp base is a [salt rock lamp](https://a.co/d/gzlOmq4) in a 3D printed shell, lined with aluminum heat insulation tape. I intend to improve the base later, but it seems to be holding up just fine for now. \n\nOver all I'm extremely pleased and excited with these results! Lmk what you think! 😁",

We had to force him to eat even a bit and had to use a syringe to get him to drink even some water.\n\nTook him back to the vet. They gave him IV fluids because he was dehydrated, and cleaned and checked his teeth in case tooth pain was stopping him from eating. After I insisted, they also took X-ray photos and one of the photos (picture 1) he had a sternal dislocation but the vet said she is almost certain it is an old injury, from perhaps since he was a kitten, and it doesn't seem to cause him pain. He doesn't mind when the bump on his chest caused by this is pressed.\nIt also showed he had a bit of osteoarthritis on his back legs (picture 3) He is getting mild pain medication for that. \n\nThe photos also showed he was constipated (picture 2) so the vet percribed him paraffin oil. After two doses of this, my cat pooped twice. But he still does not eat or drink. \n\nSo basically, still no answer as to what's wrong. We are just treating symptoms. I am losing my mind I am so worried. This has been going on for too long. I believe we could still try ultrasound but the closest is 120km away and my cat gets stressed during car rides. The vet said they do not recommend sedating my cat for the car ride there as my cat is already so weak. \nI will of course take him there, still. \nI am the type of person who would give 20years of my life to my cat if it meant we could live together longer.

It did happen over the course of a year and a half, but she went from 12 pounds (5.4kg) to 5 pounds (2.2kg) during that time.\n\nFor a while I thought she was just eating less and losing weight, she was a healthy weight for a while so I wasn’t worried, but then she got thinner and thinner and sicker and sicker. Her blood work was normal, even when she was 5 pounds, puking a lot, and refusing to eat for a couple days at a time.\n\nMy vet recommended trying Royal Canin Hydrolyzed Protein food before having to do X-rays or an ultrasound because it was most likely it wouldn’t show anything. The food worked very very well. It was like night and day the way she acted, and she did gain all her weight back eventually. \n\nAnyway, if your cat will eat it, try a hydrolyzed protein food. It’s pricey which sucks, but if your cat has a food allergy then they will keep losing weight and keep getting sicker the more they eat the food they are eating. You can ask the vet for a food allergy test, but the vet has told me as well that they are not very reliable, they don’t show the best results, so it’s best just to try if the food works or doesn’t work.",

    "body": "'Evening gents.  \nI keep reading on here and on other online forums mainly from new riders on how a bike should be cleaned/washed/maintained and which products to use/avoid.  \nMotorcycle washing isn't exactly rocket science but with 10056856786 products out there (overpriced at that) i thought of creating a guide of sorts with no \"specific\" gear/products required, just cheap-ish, normal household products (mainly).  \n\n\nWhat to avoid :   \n\\- needlessly expensive cleaning products like \"Mucc off\" and chain cleaning kits (that can cost up to 30€/$) . They're bullshit (especially Mucc off) since you'll need a large quantity for each wash and you might as well do the job easier (not to mention much better) using simpler cleaning products.  \n\\- specific types/brands of brake cleaners since they can leave permanent stains/eat through your rim(s) paint etc.  \n\\- Overly harsh chemicals (generally speaking).  \n\\- Avoid dry cleaning your motorcycle (i.e : using wet wipes/micro-fiber towels) as you can leave swirl marks that way (or even worse, scratch your paint/body work).  \n\n\nΑlso :  **Avoid (like the plague) washing your bike at gas stations** : Don't know about the US but over my side of the pond (Europe), gas stations use the cheapest, harshest chemicals/soaps for washing and in conjunction with the pressure washers they use...they can leave permanent chemical stains and/or actually remove color from painted parts on your motorcycle - i've seen M1200s's, Panigales, MTS's, Gixxers etc with discolored Ohlins forks/stains on them, discolored painted black parts and/or stains on the bodywork because of it, not a pretty sight at all.  \n\n\nWhat you'll need :  \n\\- A bucket  \n\\- A hose  \n\\-  A couple of good car-washing sponges (i.e not too harsh on the touch) - one for cleaning the bodywork of your bike, the other one for cleaning the engine/rims/exhaust/etc.  \n\\- Some good car-washing soap - Turtlewax, Meguiar's etc, they're all good and safe, get one with wax if you want.  \n\\- Some chamois leather and/or some micro-fiber towels for the drying part.  \n\\- Some silicone spray (cheap) or some (liquid) wax (more expensive) for the final, detailing part.  \n\\- A good, tested, non-aggressive motorcycle brake cleaner that won't eat through your paint - i've always used Wurth's motorcycle brake cleaner and it's been brilliant.  \n\\- Some **paraffin lamp oil** (you've read that right), it can be used to remove dirt/oil stains from your engine, lube stains from your rims/wheels, lube stains from flinged chain lube on your exhaust(s)  and generally speaking, for cleaning your chain, also : it's dirt cheap.  \n\\- A normal tooth brush (alongside the lamp oil) for cleaning your chain.  \n\\- Some good, sticky chain lube.  \n\n\nLet's start !  \n\n\n**1)** **Chain maintenance** :   \nYour chain, along with your tires are 2 of the most important parts of your bike and they both need constant monitoring.**A chain should be lubed roughly every 400Kms/250miles (give or take) as to ensure peak performance and also prolong its life.**  \nPretty easy huh ? just grab a good chain lube can (the stickier the better - i always used the Castrol racing one) and just spray your chain every 400/400+ Kms/250+ miles. No need for a motorcycle stand, just put your motorcycle's side stand down, spray the visible part of the chain, lift up your bike a little bit, move your bike backwards (or forward), spray the rest of the chain, rinse and repeat until you've lubed the whole chain.Pro-tip : *it's better to do this when your bike's chain is hot as to make the lube adhere better*, so, take it for a little spin and just spray your chain when you get back.  \nNow, every now and then it's also good to CLEAN/WASH your chain :  \n\\- Grab the paraffin oil, spray the exposed part of your chain and start rubbing/cleaning that part using a normal tooth brush, spray again some paraffin oil on the same part as to have all the excessive gunk removed, rinse and repeat by moving your bike backwards or forward as to clean the rest of the chain.  \n\n\n  \n**2) Washing** :  \nFirst of all, *your bike's engine should be COOL, never wash your bike with a hot engine/parts* as - you've guessed it - you'll leave water stains on your engine casings etc due to the difference in temperatures.  \nStarting with the disc brakes/rotors, if they're exceedingly dirty by road debris/brake pad dust, you can use some good, non aggressive brake cleaning spray, i've always used the one from Wurth with no problems whatsoever.Spray (carefully) your disc brakes and clean them thoroughly using a rag.   \n\\- hose your bike well, leave it for a couple of minutes for the water to do its thing. Be careful with your brake/clutch levers, do not over do it - same with your brake calipers, DO NOT spray water on/in them.  \n\\- Get your bucket, fill it with water and use the appropriate amount of car wash soap.  \n\\- Get the the 1st sponge (used to wash your body work/tank ONLY) and start washing the upper part of your bike, tank, headlight, mirrors, tail - you name it.  \n\\- Get the 2nd sponge (used to wash the lower parts of your bike) - engine, rims etc.  \nPro-tip : If you also cleaned your chain described in step (1), use another rag/sponge and wash your chain.  \nAfter you washed your bike thoroughly, it's time to hose it down again.  \nFor the drying part now : use the chamois leather/microfiber towels and give her a general wipe, thing is, it's not possible to reach all crevices/nooks and crannies  as to remove all the water accumulated, for that, you'll need an air blower, if you don't have one, you can take your bike for a quick ride/spin (long straights required) and squeeze on that throttle (always being careful eh ?) as to have the accumulated water removed from the hard-reaching spots (and chain).After you get back home, wipe the rest of the water droplets down using your microfiber towels/chamois (chain should be OK).  \n\n\nNow that we've got our bike all dried up, we need to give her a good shine :  \nGet your silicone spray and/or wax and apply carefully to your bodywork/engine/black plastic parts, CAREFUL when spraying the lower part(s) of your bike, you DO NOT want to spray silicone/wax by accident on your brake calipers and tires, that's a big no-no for obvious reasons.  \nPro-tip : using silicone spray and/or wax works as a kind of hydrophobic treatment, plus, you'll be able to wash your bike easier next time.Also, those black painted parts on your bike ? they'll become less black due to aging/being exposed to the elements, spraying them with silicone spray (or    \ncar dashboard spray for that matter) will revitalize their color giving that deep black effect back.  \nSilicone spray/car dashboard spray works better for the painted/unpainted black parts (plastic or not), car wax is better used for the main bodywork (tank/tail etc).  \n\n\n**Other pro-tips** :  \n\\- Rims/wheels : I've said to never dry-clean/wash your bike *but*, if it's mainly dust that you want to clean off your rims/wheels, baby wipes work wonders and the can also be used to remove chain lube stains/gunk off of them - just be careful as to not use excessive force/elbow grease as there's always danger of scratching them (if you're not careful).  \n\\- for those small rims/wheels chips/dents caused by road debris : just grab a bottle of  black nail polish.Most wheels are black so it's an easy and cheap way to touch-up your wheels.  \n\\- Always monitor the state of your tires AND chain.Don't cheap out on rubber and your chain starts developing some slack just tighten it up, if you don't know how to do it, just visit your dealer/mechanic.  \n\n\nI think i've got everything covered, if you have any questions don't be shy to ask, cheers ;)",

I wouldn’t use that at all on a bike.\n\nWith the wax, be careful to not put it on the matte parts of the bike, unless the wax is specifically designed for that. Most car waxes are for glossy paint only. \n\nBrake cleaner will attack rubber and destroy it over time. If you want to clean your discs, spray it on a clean rag and wipe the discs with it. It’s too easy otherwise to spray brake cleaner directly on the discs and have it drop on the tires, or overspray on the calibres rubber parts. \n\nChain lube interval is 400 miles or 600km according to most manufacturers recommendation.\n\nA “sticky” chain lube isn’t perfect. It’ll attract a lot of dirt. It should be sticky enough to stay on the chain, but slippery enough to not attract too much dirt, and not too liquid that it’ll fling off the chain to your rear wheel.

New ingredients you might think? What magic is in this bottle that isn't in the regular or old version of the fragrance free?

Am I paying almost twice the price for less ingredients?!  Seriously?  The only reason I can think of for the price increase is to pay for the rebranding, because you know, a new baby's ass needs the utmost care as opposed to an old baby's ass.\n\nTotal and utter bollocks.  I can't even find any reference to their old unscented version.  They've probably cleared all reference to it on the internet in order to hide their dirty secret.\n\nAnyway, I'll see you all over in the DIY aisle picking up a vat of mineral oil for a fiver to dunk a newborn in.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "[If you don't know what it is, here's the go-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHr9znwpwmQ). I am aware this is a contested issue but I'm bored and quite like reading other peoples opinions.\n\nI decided to wax my chain because I HATE degreasing and cleaning my drivetrain. I don't keep on top of it very well, and it makes me avoid cleaning my bike in general because I don't want to go anywhere near my dirty chain, chainrings and cassette. I figured £15 on some wax (with PTFE - I didn't realise until I put it in that it was bad for the environment. It is not necessary, so next time I will leave it out and I would recommend you do the same) would be worth it, even if I only used it in the best of weather conditions. And I have a history of replacing chains and cassettes way more frequently than I should because my chain gets so dirty that it wears away in no time. Like 2000-3000km.\n\nI've now done 1100km on it in the past month, and I'm pretty much sold. I went out with a buddy for a 90km ride and his chain was dirtier and noisier than mine despite having applied a leading dry-lube - and my chain had done about 300km since the last wax.\n\nMy drivetrain has never been cleaner. It actually shines. I've re-waxed the chain 4 times now. It's a bit of a pain, but really it's not as time-consuming as people say - I just melt the wax as I'm cooking my dinner - boil the kettle and pour it in a pan, stick the chain in, swish the chain round a wee bit and take it out, wipe it dry and stick the wax in to melt. When melted I stick the chain in and leave it as I eat my dinner. Then I take it out, let dry and stick it on my bike the next morning. It sounds like a lot, but honestly, it's the perfect job to do whilst you're waiting for things to cook etc.\n\nI haven't had to clean the cassette or the chainrings AT ALL and they look as good as new. Everything is clean to the touch. My chain has dropped a few times for unrelated reasons, and I put it back on with my bare hands and get zero marks or black gunk on my hands. I wouldn't hesitate to lick my chain if someone asked me.\n\nThe jockey wheels are completely spotless. Previously, after even the shortest rides I would get black gunk and mysterious hairs and fluff tangling them up, and they're a bitch to clean. Now there isn't a single bit of dirt on them.\n\nThe rest of the bike is cleaner too, because I can just take a sponge and soapy water, wipe everything clean, and then just dry the chain with a paper towel. When I take the chain off to re-wax, I can do a really thorough clean of the whole bike and it takes max 10 mins.\n\nI live in Scotland, where it rains a fair bit and the roads are never dry - there's literally algae in places. I haven't ridden in any rainstorms but I've been caught in showers of rain and snow on salty roads and there isn't a hint of rust. I've done some minor gravel riding, ridden through more sheep-shit than city-dwellers will see in their lives, and even gone through a couple of fords. I did a 200km ride with zero problems. It might not last as long if I ride through thunderstorms in the summer, but we shall wait and see. I would be more than happy to buy another batch of wax with some paraffin oil and a separate chain for wet weather and swap them around as need be.",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml. Available in 45ml,  200 ml tube and  500 ml pump bottle.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above. Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), 🌟[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, 🌟** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Crème\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.  Pictured above. Feels heavy for a lotion.\n\n**Ingredient List :**[Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), 🌟[**Zinc Oxide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide)**,** [Sorbitan Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-stearate), [PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-30-dipolyhydroxystearate), [Butylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butylene-glycol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Copper Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/copper-sulfate), 🌟 [**Mannitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol)**,** [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), 🌟 [**Xylitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol)**,** [Zinc Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-sulfate), [Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Vine Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/vitis-vinifera-vine-extract), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose),[Laureth-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-3), 🌟[**Asiaticoside**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiaticoside)**, 🌟**[**Madecassic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/madecassic-acid)**, 🌟** [**Asiatic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiatic-acid), [Hydroxyethylcellulose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethylcellulose), [Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract)\n\n**Fragrance:** A subtler version of that greasy smell, a teeny bit herbal, to be this dissipates the quickest of all the bioderma moisturisers.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  😍 I love it. I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

    "body": "I just want to preface this post by saying that I like Jaclyn Hill. I bought Champagne Pop when it first came out because 1) I wanted to support Jaclyn and 2) it looked like a beautiful highlighter in a color I don’t have. I thought the highlighter was going to be limited edition….it ended up being permanent and I felt silly to have woken up at a strange hour to order it. I don’t regret purchasing it because its my most used highlighter in my collection. \n\n\nRecently, I saw a review on the eyeshadow palette that is part of this new collection that JH did with Becca. This youtuber (Rita B) was disappointed with the disparity in formula between JH eye palette and other Becca palettes. \n\n\nIt seems as if Becca used cheaper ingredients and a standard formula to mass produce these palettes cheaper and quicker. They cut corners to make more money. So I got curious as to whether the formula for the highlighter was the same or different in the palette vs the single. Lo and behold – it’s DIFFERENT. In the JH face palette, MICA is the first ingredient, whereas in the single TALC is the first ingredient. This leads me to believe that Becca put more fillers in the Champagne pop in the face palette to save production costs. TALC is an additional ingredient in the blush Rose Spritz whereas its not in the regular blush formula. I’m disappointed to be honest.

For instance, while regular MAC brushes are handmade and typically use higher end fibres (real and synthetic), their holiday brush sets are always machine made and low quality fibres. Many companies use cheaper quality ingredients in palettes as the price is quite low for a large number of shades which is more of a pain in the ass to manufacture. A change in ingredients doesn't necessarily automatically equate to a lesser quality, but it's always a good idea to be wary of limited products. I always advise waiting out the first batch if you can, and then read reviews from people you trust or swatch it yourself if you can get the chance. Yes, it's not as exciting and sometimes brands market it in such a way that \"it might be your only chance\" - but it'll save you $$.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

There were literally just 6star evo mats, the event weapon materials, and the materias.\n\n**Event Duration**:\n\n9.5 days vs 14 days (u/zolares)\n\n**Price changes**:\n\nMaterias:\n\n- Thunderfall 2400 -> 6000\n\n- Here We Go 1600 -> 5600\n\n- Attacker 1200 -> 2600\n\n- Defender 800 -> 2600\n\n- Stat +10% (excluding Attack +10%) 800 -> 2000\n\n\nMaterials:\n\n- Enhancing Tail 40 -> 80\n\n- Menacing Wings 40 -> 80\n\n- Iridium Plug 40 -> 50\n\n- Paraffin Oil 80 -> 80\n\n- Crystal Oscillator 120 -> 120\n\n\nExclusive Weapons:\n\n- Hyades Magnum DNE -> 5000\n\n- Malboro Wand DNE -> 5500\n\n- Calamity Spear DNE -> 5000\n\n- Tezcatlipoca DNE -> 5500\n\n\nOther stuff:\n\n- Rare Summon Ticket DNE -> 28000 for 10\n\n- 1st Moogle DNE -> 30000\n\n- 2nd Moogle DNE -> 70000\n\n- Gigantuars DNE -> 10000 for 100\n\n\n\nOh, since it was the first event, no limit to 6 star materials.\n\nInfo taken from the GL megathread and Famitsu.\n\nRealized I do not know how to reddit format at all.",

        "body": "Let me see if I have this straight...\n\nSo, they added the bonus on gear drops for the banner units in GL\n\nBut they raised the overall cost of event items by 2 to 3 times as much\n\nAnd then they gave us some exclusive weapons and items not present in the JP event like Cactuars and Tickets?\n\n... That's overall worse, IMO. You need several bonus units in your team to come close to getting enough gears per run to make up for the increased cost of event items and that's kinda difficult because first you have to spend enough money pulling to get multiple bonus units and then you have to spend the time and NRG to grind them up to being capable of even entering the ELT dungeon, otherwise you're stuck on PRO. In which case, you'd be better off not getting the bonus units and just grinding ELT with your main team. In short, the event items are just flat out more difficult/time-consuming to get in GL.\n\nI'd rather we didn't have the increased event items cost but lost the bonus on banner units. It doesn't work out in our favor unless you're a mega-whale.\n\nI guess being able to grind some tickets is nice, though...",

This is also a reasonable explanation for why they split the Unit Summon (and Lightning Bonus) to two weeks instead of one. \n\nAs for why they did this, my guess is simply because they need more time for either a Global exclusive Christmas event (guessing since we had a global exclusive Halloween one) or that new Noctis release announcement. Unlike before, Noctis is being released at around the same time as Japan so they might need more time to work it into the game. \n\nBut I do stress that this is just my guess.",

(This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "*The following account was found in a box of diaries purchased in a London auction house in 1977. While its validity remains questionable, certain records suggest that events similar to those described did occur in Punjab Province in February, 1905.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n...I did not know wealth as a young man. My father had a weak constitution and died of cholera shortly after my twentieth year. With what money I had earned and what little he had left me I bought passage to India. I had been told that a man could make his fortune there, and I was a fool then for I believed it. For a few years I wandered through the North, working any job I could, and like this I narrowly scraped by. \n\nFinally, in 1881, I found myself a position on a steamboat which ran supplies and guns to the outposts of the North-West Frontier. It was only one job to begin with, but the captain offered to keep me on, and I was willing, for the pay was good. Two jobs turned to three, three to four and so on. What had begun as a temporary occupation turned into my profession, and for more than two decades I worked up the Indus River. \n\nThroughout those years I saw many strange sights and met a great number of peculiar people and I reckon I could tell a thousand tales from those days. However, none rattled me so much as the incident at Pala-Kani. I can only describe the entire episode and its circumstances as bizarre, and while it troubles me to admit it, nothing more than that singular event facilitated my retirement from the river service. \n\nIt was in February of 1905, and had started as a routine supply trip. By then I was the second officer aboard the steamboat *Ursula*, crewed by ten and commanded by Captain Müller, an ageing Austrian widely known to be a martinet. We left Hyderabad at the beginning of the year and travelled five hundred miles up river to arrive in Nandla a month later. \n\nThe way there was easy enough. We were not beset by any problems and everyone aboard was cheerful as could be. After arriving in Nandla, our ship was joined by a single passenger, a young lieutenant who had become bored with frontier life and was headed back to England after resigning his commission. After a day the haulers had unloaded the supplies at the outpost, and soon we were ready for the return journey. \n\nWe were away quickly, and all seemed well. The dry season never causes much bother on the river, and we were glad of the rest. Normally we would have stopped a few days for standard repairs; however, Müller’s efficiency was unmatched, and he insisted that we get back to Hyderabad for the next assignment as soon as possible. The overworked engine seized after two weeks headed downriver, and we were forced to stop for onboard repairs. \n\nSo it was that on an afternoon in late February, we docked at a small village nestled in an oxbow. The youngest of our crew, a Multan lad who had some knowledge of the area, told us it was called Pala-Kani. The landscape of the region was desolate and barren, but within three miles on either side of the river, swathes of dense brush and forest crept out into the watercourse. Pala-Kani stood as a little dusty outcrop amongst an untouched sea of green. \n\nWhile Müller ordered the engineer to assess the damage, I was sent for fresh water and food from the village, and to have a telegram sent to the shipping office in Hyderabad alerting them of our delayed arrival. I took Daniel Thomas, the stoker, and Atma, the Multan boy, for I did not know the language. We were also joined by the young lieutenant, who was eager to stretch his legs after his long period of stagnation.\n\nHowever, as soon as we had drawn up along the banks, something struck me as odd. So many of the other sleepy villages along the meandering Indus had grown used to the river traffic, and therefore gave little attention to visitors. The only ones to ever take notice were the children, who lazily watched us from the banks and sometimes waved and laughed or threw rocks as far as they could. However, Pala-Kani greeted us in numbers. All of us flocked to the sides to see dozens of villagers, arms raised, shouting for us to come down. \n\nMost of the men thought that this was some practice of hospitality, and were eager to disembark. Müller, however, who disapproved of congregating with the natives, ordered all to stay aboard. Only we four descended, and as we did so, the locals seemed to be gathering about the young lieutenant. Being of seniority, I had Atma translate the questions of the loudest village representative, a slender old man.\n\n“Where have you come from? How many are you?” he began. \n\n“We are from Nandla heading to Hyderabad, we are here to purchase food and water.”\n\n“Are there soldiers with you?”\n\n“No, we are not a military vessel. Can we buy supplies here?”\n\n“You help us and we will give you water.”\n\n“Help you with what?”\n\n“There is danger in the forest.”\n\nBandits were nothing new in the North. Afghan warlords have always seen it as their right to range across the frontier, raiding as they go, and I have known many hamlets and villages ransacked in the night, with groaning wounded and weeping children left behind to starve. I turned to Thomas, who had been in the river service nearly as long as myself.\n\n“Danny, how many arms do we carry?” \n\n“We have the five rifles, but as you know Jack they’re rusted something awful,” he replied.\n\n“That they are Danny. Still, might do to try and scare off the blighters.”\n\n“Depends on how many of them there are,” interjected the young lieutenant, who had been listening intently to all the goings on. \n\nI nodded to Atma, and he gave the question to the old man. Atma listened and furrowed his brow. As he thought on the elder’s words I could tell he was having trouble figuring out a translation. \n\n“I think sir, that it is not a human danger. He says it is a beast.”\n\n“A tiger no doubt,” said the lieutenant.\n\n“Ah well,” said Thomas, “I reckon a few flares should see it off.”\n\n“And how many flares do we have Danny?” I asked. \n\n“Ten or so signal flares, they burn dreadful crimson at night.”\n\n“Grand, then we’ll scare it off tonight. Tell them we’ll help them this evening Atma, in the meanwhile we’ll have our food and water.”\n\nAtma told the elder, but he and the rest of the crowd, who had been largely silent during our exchange, seemed to find this unsatisfactory, and they spent some time chattering amongst themselves. Eventually the old man spoke up.\n\n“He says,” Atma translated, “That they would rather have us help them now during the day, he says it is dangerous at night, he says it comes at night.”\n\n“Tell him we have guns.”\n\n“He says it makes no difference.”\n\n“We’ll see,” I scoffed, although in honesty I was becoming nervous, “Then tell him that we’ll have to see what we can do.”\n\nWith that, we returned to the ship. Müller was barking orders down to the engineer, who was still deciding on the best course of repair. I joined the captain on the quarterdeck and explained that a tiger in the forest was causing trouble, and that if we killed it, the villagers would grant us all the food and water we’d need. Upon reporting the situation, he grew unusually contemplative. \n\n“Tigers eh?” he finally said, “I do not think it wise to go near the forest. Tell them that we’ll pay in cash for the supplies.”\n\n“I don’t think they want the money Captain Müller, they seem to be more worried about the beast. \n\n“Well then we will have to do without Mr. Daventry.”\n\n“Very well sir, but seeing as it wouldn’t do any harm, might the lieutenant, Mr. Thomas, Atma and myself take the rifles and scout around the village? Just to put their minds at ease.”\n\n“Seeing as there is nothing to be done aboard at present, I will allow it. But I warn you Mr. Daventry, no good ever came of chasing after tigers. You must return by evening.”\n\n“Aye sir.” \n\nI descended and yelled for Atma to fetch the rifles from below. I joined Thomas and the lieutenant on the bow.\n\n“So what’s the plan Jack?” asked Thomas.\n\n“We’ll look around a bit. Not much else we can do.”\n\n“What about the beast? The tiger! We can’t pass up a hunt,” said the lieutenant. \n\n“Müller’s orders. Besides, I haven’t a clue about hunting, let alone tigers.”\n\nHere the lieutenant became very excited, and began to recount stories about his uncle's big game hunts in Africa, and how the same uncle had been employed in shooting tigers which terrorised railway workers in Kenya. He even got out a ring to show to us, he told us his uncle had taken it from one of the victims as a kind of memento. He seemed to have got it into his head that he was on an adventure, and ran off to his cabin to get his own hunting rifle. \n\n“He’s got no patience that one,” Thomas remarked as Atma handed him a rifle. \n\n“That he doesn’t Danny,” I said as I slung mine over my shoulder.\n\nOnce we were all ready, we came down the gangplank much to the relief of the elder and his villagers. We were led by the old man through the settlement and in the direction of the distant woodland. As we approached from the spindly dock we saw the bay absent of any fisherman’s dinghy or longboat, which was unusual for the hamlets of the Indus. The village itself was a meagre assortment of huts and bungalows all centred around a meeting hall. \n\nSmoke rose from perhaps half the buildings, but even with such a large crowd it did not seem very populated. There were empty traps and nets hanging from the buildings, all of which were vacant. We were led onward through the settlement and into the fields. Except for our guide, the villagers began to disperse as we traversed further along. The wind blew over the small plain and whistled through the dry maize, which rustled all around us as we proceeded. \n\nBeyond, we could see the forest, and the closer we got, the denser it looked. We were about halfway between the village and the forest when the old man stopped. He stood before a post, and would not take his eyes off the woods in front of him. While the rest of the fields had been harvested, the land beyond the post had evidently been abandoned, leaving a markedly barren territory.\n\nThe lieutenant looked as if he were about to continue, but the elder grabbed his arm and looked into his eyes with terror. Atma translated his warning. \n\n“He says that the marker should not be crossed so close to the day’s end.” \n\n“Would he have us come back tomorrow? We can’t kill the damn thing if we can’t get in the forest.”\n\nThe old man looked fraught with fear, and was nervously shifting his weight. His discomfort soon became our own. The lieutenant had taken a ring in the shape of a snake from his tunic and slipped it on his finger. It was the one from Kenya. \n\n“Come on, the sooner we get it over with, the better,” said Danny, and he was the first forward. The lieutenant joined him, as did I. Atma looked just as frightened as the old man, and I said he could stand guard if he wished, which I think relieved him greatly.\n\nAs we went up the road, the forest seemed to loom. It was lit up beautifully with the afternoon sun behind it, and a few rays of light seemed to penetrate its canopy, but it made it seem so much more immense, so much more impenetrable than when we saw it from the *Ursula* as we chugged along the river. Stumps of corn lay uncollected and rotting beneath our boots, and they made an awful crunch as we stepped through them. \n\n“That’s strange,” observed the lieutenant.\n\n“What’s that?” I said. \n\n“There’s another post here. And over there, another one!”\n\nAt intervals ranging from a few feet to several yards, the path bore a series of wooden posts. All of them were painted red and decorated with an assortment of plants, flowers, and small bits of animal bone.\n\n“What do you think they mean?” I asked.\n\n“I haven’t the foggiest.” he replied.\n\n“It’s simple,” began Thomas, “They put one up for every victim.” \n\nHis solemn hypothesis put us all in a sombre state as we passed by the tenth or so marker. \n\n“It must be getting bolder,” said the lieutenant.\n\n“Or it’s realisin’,” said Thomas. \n\n“Realising what Danny?”\n\n“Realising they can’t do nothin’ about it.”\n\nWe said nothing more until we came to the end of the deserted fields. Small bushes and a few fig trees had taken hold on the side of the fence that marked the beginning of the settlement, and they turned into the forest further along the path. Apart from the buzz of insects in the pasture, the forest seemed to be enveloped in an eerie silence. \n\n“This place gives me the fear,” muttered Thomas. \n\n“What’s the plan then?” I asked.\n\nThe lieutenant, who looked far less enthusiastic than he had an hour before, thought for a full minute before he spoke. \n\n“I say we go up the road a ways, look for any pathways in the brush. The first thing we need to do is find the lair, then we’ll flush the bastard out.”\n\nThomas and I took this formulation as sufficient, and we nodded in agreement. He took the lead and we followed up behind, our rifles unslung. The path had not been travelled in some time, and roots and weeds had begun to cleave their way through the dry earth. Arms and branches of ancient hardwoods crept out above, as if they sought to reclaim the narrow strip of road. \n\nNeither birdsong nor the monotonous chirp of insects were to be heard, only the wind far above. It had been a hot day, and the ground was caked in dust, but here, it was like entering a cellar. However, the cool air was not welcoming. My skin crawled with the sudden chill and I rolled down my shirt sleeves. Danny, who was ahead of me, was looking back and forth nervously. \n\n“It’s not right,” said Danny. \n\n“Quiet man! If the bugger hears us we’ll never find him!” hoarsely whispered the lieutenant. \n\n“What couldn’t hear us here? We must be the only living things in the godforsaken place,” said Thomas. \n\n“That’s why he’s preying on the villagers. My uncle told me about this sort of thing. It was the same in Kenya with the railway workers. When the lion runs out of beasts to hunt, he comes for man.” \n\nHe dramatically bore his hand into a fist to show the snake ring on his little finger. \n\n“How many villagers would you say there were Jack?” asked Thomas. \n\n“I don’t know, fifty? Maybe more,” I postulated. \n\n“And how many huts did you count?”\n\n“God, I don’t bloody know! I wasn’t counting them as sheep Dan.”\n\n“Well I did, and I tell you there’s something off here. There were thirty huts or more, and I’ve known with a population of a hundred live in fewer than twenty.”\n\n“What’s your point Danny?”\n\n“There’s just too few of ‘em.”\n\nAgain, this somber remark turned us quiet, and for the better part of an hour we eased our way up the wood. Not once did we see any disturbance in the foliage, and no pathways that the tiger could have used appeared. In fact, the further we went, the worse it got. The silence seemed to pierce our ears, a kind of pinching hum emanated from all around. I think we all hoped the wood would run out and we would be greeted by the familiar bleak plains of Punjab, but no such luck. Through the canopy, the sky seemed darker, and it was clear that night would be on us soon. \n\n“I say we turn back,” I said, and the others gravely nodded. \n\nWe trekked back quite carelessly, and even if we had maintained a cautious retreat, there was no chance the beast hadn’t realised our presence. I hoped that it was satisfied in our bold advance, and that it would not return to the village. However, I quickly dismissed this wishful thinking.\n\nWe emerged from the wilderness just as the sun declined behind *Ursula*’s funnel, and we saw the elder and Atma sitting by the distant marker. Atma stood up and waved, a cheerful sight. Although I pitied the villagers, I was glad at the prospect of getting back on the river. \n\n“Look there Jack,” said Danny, pointing. \n\nFor the first time I saw that the small riverboats had been piled between the outermost huts, so as to create a kind of barricade. \n\n“Poor blighters.”\n\nWe were led back, and as we passed back through Pala-Kani, the villagers had changed from a bare hope to a doleful resignation. The faces of the little ones were undoubtedly the worst. I suspected that it had begun with the children. \n\nI asked Atma to tell the old man that we had found nothing, and that perhaps the beast was scared off by our presence alone. His response was silence. \n\nWe returned to the ship quickly, where the lieutenant found the captain and spoke with him hurriedly.  I talked with the engineer, who had assessed the damage as extensive. *Ursula* was hardly in her prime, and the replacement parts would need to be adjusted. Having underestimated the extent of our engine troubles, Müller had withdrawn to his cabin to make preparations for the journey tomorrow morning.\n\nThe prospect of being moored to that place, that cursed village, unsettled Thomas and I, and we leant over the bulwarks gazing at the forest’s edge for some time. We knew that the beast, or whatever it was, would not cease its attacks on our account. \n\n“I have an idea,” said the excited lieutenant, who had decided to interrupt our vigil. \n\n“Good evening,” I said. \n\n“We’ll light the place up, get a perimeter of torches. That way we’ll be able to see it coming and kill it at a distance.”\n\n“We’re not sharpshooters, Lieutenant,” I said. \n\n“Well perhaps not, but I’m a decent shot from a few hundred yards. I think I could ease down close by the tall leaves, close enough to wound the beast at least.”\n\n“Seems like a fool’s errand,” said Thomas. \n\n“What does the captain think?”\n\n“I’ve spoken with Müller, he seemed unconvinced but allowed us the materials.”\n\nI looked at Danny, he said nothing. He was right, it was a fool’s errand, but I agreed that it was better than doing nothing. The lieutenant recruited Atma to find yard posts, rags and a can of paraffin oil. We helped him carry it all down to the village and into the outer fields. The villagers and their elder watched us from the barricade, tentatively whispering to one another. \n\nThe four of us spent the better part of an hour hammering in posts a few feet apart a hundred or so yards around the barricade of boats as we worked against the setting sun. The darkening day cast long shadows as we plunged the last post into the dry earth. \n\nAs the sky sank from pale red to dim purple, we wet the rags in paraffin and set the posts alight. We layed damp blankets below so as to stop the fields from catching fire, then all of us retired to the village, save the lieutenant. He scouted out a shallow mound behind which he took up his position, rifle in hand, barely a hundred yards from the torches.\n\nThus began our lonely night. We had been waiting and watching no more than an hour when Thomas spoke up in his usual dismal mood. \n\n“What are we going to do if he gets himself killed?” .\n\n“Beats me Danny, but I don’t think he’s that much of a fool,”\n\n“I reckon we’ll need our rifles before the night’s out,” he said dolefully. \n\n“Very well. You go with Atma and get the three best ones, and two dozen rounds for each man, just to be sure.”\n\nHe nodded and off they went, leaving me in the company of the two villagers who hadn’t withdrawn into their huts. The lieutenant was crouching perfectly still, his rifle tilted back behind the mound, his head peeking out into the darkness. He had taken off his pith helmet and lain it by his side, where a few cartridges had been conveniently placed. \n\nThe torches flickered in the wind coming from up river, and it seemed to grow exponentially darker as the deep blue sky turned to starless black. Then I began to hear it. It started as hardly noticeable, perhaps the result of yawning a few times in a row. But I knew it wasn't that. It was that hum, that piercing hum that sent a spike into one’s head and caused a wave of blinking.\n\nThat dreadful noise, if I can rightly call it a noise, made me dip my head down and cover my ears, but even then it just kept on, like needles had been driven into my ears. I looked up to see the young lieutenant, absolutely still. Worse than that, I could sense movement beyond. The darkness seemed to shift, not like a beast moving within it, but the night itself was shifting around our solitary outpost of light, and we knew that it could, at any moment, envelope us. \n\nThe lieutenant raised his rifle and aimed it at a confluence of movement. In one swift movement he locked the bolt and pulled the trigger, and the deafening explosion sent a wave of screaming through the village. At once, every single one of the torches were extinguished. It was as if the candles had been blown out on a cake. The last thing I glimpsed in the dim light of the burning posts was the lieutenant, standing up to meet his end, rifle in hand. \n\nI  froze. The calamity of the situation dawned on me as I turned back to the ship. Distantly I could make out the silhouettes of men by the gangplank. Danny’s voice cried out for me and I ran towards the sound. Behind me I could sense it moving; the whole darkness had surrounded the village. I could have tripped at any moment, for I would have been running blind had it not been for the *Ursula*’s gas-lamps. I dared not look behind me, for that electric hum snapped at the hairs on my neck. Just as I was sure that it had caught me, someone let off a signal flare and the whole plain was illuminated in the horrible crimson light.\n\nI was not as far from the ship as I had anticipated, and it wasn’t long before I reached the dock. At the gangplank I was greeted by Danny, Atma, the engineer and Captain Müller, all armed to the teeth. As I approached them I looked back. The village and its fields were desolate and devoid of any trace of the young marksman. The only thing I spotted by the lieutenant’s perch was his helmet, in the same place he had left it. \n\n“What the Devil were you thinking!?” cried the captain. \n\nMüller’s face burned red with unrelenting rage, but behind his fury I could sense that he had the same biting fear in his heart as the rest of us. I couldn’t think. The hum had reached its full intensity, and I thought my skull would explode if it didn’t subside. \n\n“He told us, he told you—”\n\n“The Lieutenant said he’d spoken to you sir, he said he’d told you his plan,” Danny interrupted.\n\n“He did no such thing Mr. Thomas! Now come on, if we are to have any decent chance at finding him, we must start within the next hour,” Müller scornfully peered at me, “You look ill Mr. Daventry. You had best get back to quarters. Atma, take him back to the ship.” \n\n“Aye aye, sir,” said the lad, and grasping my arm we staggered back aboard. \n\nI did not exactly sleep through that night, for I heard so much shouting and commotion that it would have been impossible regardless. That throbbing noise would not leave despite feeble attempts to quell my agitation. But eventually, as the rest of them returned towards the dawn, I began to drift into dreamless and painful slumber. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I awoke we had already left the village far behind. The last memory I have of it is bathed in the red light of the flares and the villagers confusedly trying to get passage on the ship. \n\nThomas told me they scoured the fields well into the night, and only stopped when they ran out of signal glares. They found neither hide nor hair of the young lieutenant. Atma took the helmet back, although I don’t quite know why. Müller had ordered us away as soon as the repairs were finished, and as the ship sputtered to life and pulled away down the river, Atma and Thomas looked at the tired and haggard faces of the villagers as they peered at their last hope disappear behind the oxbow. Neither Danny nor Atma could not count the elder’s face in amongst them. \n\nTwo weeks later we reached Hyderabad. Müller reported the incident at the magistrate’s office. It was only when we wired the news of the lieutenant’s disappearance to the Nandla outpost that we realised none of us remembered his name, although he had certainly told it to us. That was my last job on the Indus. I haven’t seen that place since, nor should I care to. \n\nHowever, I’m afraid that was not the last I heard of Pala-Kani. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDan Thomas never stopped working the rivers, as he had known no other life,  but migrated south after the incident. It was only eight years later that we had a chance meeting in Kochi, where I had found work in the shipping office. \n\nOf course, we shared a few drinks, and a few turned to many and we talked about the old days on the river, and old Captain Müller, who had apparently died two years back, and how the rest of the lads were doing. Eventually, our conversation drifted towards the end of my career, and inevitably to the subject of the Pala-Kani incident. \n\n“They had an investigation, you know,” he said after a long silence, “The Provincial Superintendent even got Atma to lead him and his men up the river, up the very same route—just to see where the poor blighter had got to.”\n\n“And?” \n\n“Nothing,” he took a long swig from his glass, “Nothing. They went in one side of the oxbow and came out the other without any break in the trees...it was like,” Danny paused, and he shifted in his seat, his eyebrows lowered, “It was like there had never been a village there at all.” \n\nThere was another long silence before I spoke.\n\n“Did you ever find out his name?”\n\n“Oh, someone told it to me but I’ve forgotten Jack. I shouldn’t like to remember it anyhow,” he took another long gulp, “Müller told me after that the tribunal ruled the death an act of God.” \n\n“The death? It a disappearance, wasn't it?”\n\nHe shook his head, and looked me in the eye.\n\n“It was a full year after. A full bloody year. A hand washed up in Nandla. It had that ring Jack. On the little finger. Remember? That Kenyan ring?”\n\n“I remember Danny.” \n\nI could picture it now, the ring in the shape of a snake. Thomas filled his glass and downed it at once.\n\n“One of his old chums identified it. Christ above, Jack—it was as if it were sliced off that very day, clean as a knife through butter.”\n\nHe shook his head again. \n\n“Do you ever wonder Jack? About what was in that forest? There weren’t nothing good in it. Nothing at all. I can’t help thinking of it. It’s the same feeling you get, on those dark nights, you know? Do you remember how dark it was? Couldn’t see your own nose in front of you. It was a miracle it didn’t get the lot of us. I think it could’ve, mind you. No, it were toying with us. It won out in the end. There weren’t nothing we could do. Nothing at all,” he stopped, deep in contemplation, “Anyway, that was the last I heard of it.”\n\nI solemnly nodded, and we finished our drinks. We talked a little more about the changing times, the river service, and the state of the Raj, but soon we parted ways. It wasn’t long after our chance meeting that I left India. That was twelve years ago now, and I haven’t seen Dan Thomas since...",

Putting a drop of water on the crack reduces the strength by about 20% whereas moistening the crack with dry paraffin oil strengthens the tube by about 20%. Milligan does not advance an explanation for either of these effects, but many glassblowers can attest to the accuracy of the statement that water in the scratch reduces the strength of the glass tubing\".\n\nTo cut glass, a cutting tool is used to make a scored line, then the glass is tapped or torqued and the stress concentration at the scratch causes the glass to break along the desired line.\n\nGlassblowers always suggest wetting the scored mark to make the break easier, cleaner, and more reliable.

    "body": "Hello everyone, sharing this for all those who need a little bit of hope. Maybe you'll find something useful too. You are not alone! You got this! Sending you all a virtual hug.\n\n**Background information**\n\nI am a 25-year-old cis woman living in Europe. I was on the combined contraceptive pill for 5 years. Before developing vestibulodynia I never had any kind of vulvar or vaginal pain. I am experiencing this condition in a heterosexual relationship.\n\n**My villain origin story**\n\nIt all started 2 years ago, when for no apparent reason, I had several recurrent yeast infections, which were treated with classic oral and vaginal medications. After the yeast infections, I also had a gardnerella vaginalis infection twice, which was then treated with antibiotics and creams. This all took place over a period of 9 months, and by this time I had already realized that the constant use of these products was irritating my vulva, which was becoming more and more sensitive, between redness, burning, itching and bleeding.\n\nIn January 2022 I went to the gynecologist convinced that I had an infection again, as I was presenting with the usual symptoms, itching and burning and severe pain during penetration. However, all tests (including for STDs) came back negative. The gynecologist also performed an ultrasound on me, but there was no abnormality. The gynecologist then told me that there was nothing she could do for me.\n\nAt this point I was desperate, feeling completely abandoned alone with my pain without knowing what to do. Having penetrative sex or even just being touched with fingers was impossible and every attempt ended with me in tears. This situation brought me immense frustration : I felt like I had lost a part of me and intimacy with my partner. Activities like riding a bike were no longer feasible. All my tightest clothes had become a torture to wear.\n\n**Finally a diagnosis!**\n\nIn the meantime, however, reading on the Internet, I inquired and suspected that I had vestibulodynia. I exposed this doubt to another gynecologist, who confirmed it and advised me to start pelvic physiotherapy. In the following months I had the opportunity to meet with another gynecologist specializing in vulvar-vaginal pain, who further elaborated on the diagnosis. According to him, it is a mix between a hormonal vestibulodynia and an acquired neuroproliferative vestibulodynia. Basically, the gynecologist suspects that the combined pill has weakened my mucous membrane and made my skin thinner, which, combined with countless infections and aggressive creams, has made my nerves more \"exposed\", specifically in the 5-7 o'clock area. In the following months I then worked in order to resolve the situation, accompanied by the gynecologist and my beloved physical therapist. If you were looking for a miracle solution in my story, know that you will be disappointed : in order to find relief I used a **holistic/comprehensive approach**, tackling different dimensions of my condition at the same time.\n\n**Creams and medicines**\n\n* I stopped the contraceptive pill as soon as possible. I currently use condoms as my only means of contraception.\n* My doctor prescribed a compounded preparation of 0.1% testosterone and 0.01% estradiol, to be used twice a day for several weeks. Now I use it only a few times a week. This cream is super useful to restore the vulvar mucosa!\n* In addition to this cream I apply a protective cream that I love called Deumavan Intim Neutral. I don't know if it is available worldwide, but the ingredients are : Paraffinum Liquidum, Petrolatum, Paraffin, Tocopheryl Acetate. I love this cream as it is ultra gentle. I think Aquaphor is very similar.\n* I also stopped using classic intimate soaps, and started using Der-med, a medical moisturizing skin wash lotion, which also helped me! During the peak of inflammation, I simply stopped using soap on my vulva and only rinsed with lukewarm water.\n* I also tried lidocaine, but personally it caused me terrible burning which only made it worse. So I stopped it shortly after that.\n* Finally, my gynecologist recommended that in the future, I treat vaginal infections only through oral medicines and no vaginal creams or ovules.\n\n**Physical pelvic therapy (PPT)**\n\nThis aspect has been central for me not only in the physical aspect but also in the mental side, as I have been fortunate to be followed by a super competent person. Being a condition that I faced mostly on my own, being able to rely on her expertise brought me a lot of comfort. This is what pelvic therapy consisted of.\n\n* I had approximately 30 sessions. For the first 20 sessions we saw each other once a week, and then every 2 weeks. These sessions took place over a period of about 8 months. During the first 9 sessions I was very pessimistic, I still had a lot of pain and I was not convinced it would help me. But then over time I realized that there were beginning to be small improvements. The process is very gradual, which is why it is unrealistic to expect improvement overnight. Mentally, you have to put into account that physiotherapy for vestibulodynia is a process that lasts many months.\n* As for exercises, be prepared for a lot of manual therapy. In the beginning, we worked mainly on stretching/unclenching the muscles with trigger point therapy and myofascial release. Because I had begun to associate sex/penetration with pain, my muscles had begun to contract automatically on these occasions, which only made things worse. So thanks to my physical therapist, I learned to do diaphragmatic breathing, control my pelvic muscle and to stop contracting automatically. This made me feel very empowered as I felt I could be a little be in charge of my own body/pain, and not the other way round.\n* After that we worked a lot with tissue desensitization, alternate focus and emotional release. Toward the end, we also added dilators and TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) therapy.\n* At present, given my improvement, we ended the sessions. In fact, my reported pain has gone from 8/9/10 to 1/2 or even 0 on good days. Now it is up to me to continue the exercises at home: stretching (pigeon pose, baby pose etc) and self-massage. I also ordered a TENS vaginal probe to continue this therapy.\n\n**Couple and sexual life**\n\nThis was definitely the most difficult part of all, as vestibulodynia brought me enormous frustration, but also insecurity toward my partner. The moments of sex were all now mixed with anxiety. If you are in a relationship, what I can recommend is first and foremost to reflect on your partner: do you feel safe? Do they ask for your consent before touching you? Do they avoid putting pressure on you? Are they interested in what your body is going through? Are they ready to put their sexual practices back on the table to accommodate your changing needs? If there are any \"no's\" in your answers, ask yourself if this might not play some part in the pain you are experiencing. Sometimes our bodies try to talk to us in these ways.\n\nBeyond that, here are some tips that have helped me get through this period with my partner:\n\n* Use a vibrator all the time! The vibration is great for confusing the brain about sensations, and it often helped me feel less pain\n* Take advantage of this period to explore new sexual practices and play games beyond penetration!\n* If sex at the moment is simply too much for you, but you still want to share some physical intimacy, I recommend the \"Sensate Focus\" exercise, an internet search will give you all the info\n* Finally, when I was slowly able to try penetration again, I learned to really take my time, to overindulge with foreplay, and only begin penetration when I was dying for it. All of course with gallons/liters of lube!\n\n**Mental aspect**\n\nFinally, with all the tears I have shed, I understand very well how difficult the period you are going through is. I personally have talked a lot about it with my psychologist, and I strongly encourage you to also seek help if you feel too down about the situation.\n\nFinally, a general piece of advice that took me a long time to embrace myself, is that you have to accept that vestibulodynia is a slow condition to heal and it will take months, maybe years. But the improvement is there. Be patient. Be gentle with your body. Don't force yourself to do activities that hurt, to wear clothes that fit uncomfortably, to have sex when you don't feel like it. Gradually over time, without almost noticing, you will be able to do more and more things.\n\n**So in conclusion : can I have sex??!**\n\nThe answer is yes, and it's satisfying and pleasurable!! I won't lie, I'm not yet at the stage where it's like before vestibulodynia, I still have to be careful not to overdo certain movements, take my time and stop early those times I feel the burning sensation is coming. But compared to a year ago, I can do so many more things, and on the best days I can have sex with absolutely no pain. And after penetrative sex the slight burning sensation (if any) stays for a few hours, no longer for a whole week. In short, my journey is not over and there are still things I want to work on, including the itchy sensation that appears now occasionally (instead of the pain that used to appear). The situation is not perfect yet, but for now it has allowed me to look to the future with much more optimism and to live my daily life with much less pain and worry.\n\n\nPT EXERCISES: \n\nFor relaxation techniques during insertion/penetration (finger, dilator, penis, toy, ... ), which would be interesting to pursue, with the aim of stretching tissues, relaxing, re-educating at sensory level and thus helping the body to regain neutral sensations and also pleasure, I mention : calm breathing, \"sun massage\" (from the center of the tension/discomfort outwards), visualizing a rubber band or other telling image (like a flower opening) if tension starts to set in, repeating reassuring phrases (like \"I feel good\", \"I'm safe\", \"I trust\") as well as contracting/relaxing can help. If you do arrive at a point of pain, there are several other strategies that can further relieve/eliminate it:\n     1. Stop the penetration movement without withdrawing, observe for 3 breaths to understand exactly what the unpleasant sensation is (how intense, on which point, etc.); contract the perineum as hard as possible for 3 breaths afterwards; observe again: normally the movement can already continue more easily. You can repeat this several times;\n    2. Performing small vibration movements around the perineum, or even using a vibrator, can also be very effective in reducing pain; there's also a vibratory ring that can be placed around the base of the penis, to create this vibration with with/through a partner\n    3. The \"sun\" massage effect (either abdominal or genital), can also be used just as a tissue relaxation technique, as well as during insertion and penetration.\nSun massage effect: you should massage your vulva doing outwards motions, as if you were stretching a pizza dough if it’s makes sense\n4. Alternative focus: massage/touch another area of the body (where it doesn't hurt) at the same time and focus on this neutral sensation and, little by little, focus again on the area where the discomfort/pain was present. This will help the brain to understand that if the movement is the same, the sensation should be the same, and it may stimulate a new interpretation of the information. \n    5. Accompany the movement: During insertion or penetration, you can accompany the movement on either side of the outer lips, by applying some pressure towards the \"inside\" (same direction of insertion/penetration movement). This normally has a \"reassuring\" effect on the body.",

The other day I was reading an article the other day about how much plastic is being dumped into the environment and I was shocked to find out that even random remote beaches are littered with plastic waste. In the article, it mentioned that a recent study published in the journal Nature characterized 414 million pieces of plastic — 238 metric tons — on one remote island chain in the Indian Ocean. And then you have places like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch that consists of 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic (around 80,000 metric tons).\n\nIt’s honestly pretty crazy how much plastic is damaging the ocean and it feels like the current methods of trying to dissolve/prevent are clearly not working. I saw that the author of the article I mentioned earlier came out with another article a couple of days later talking about a new way of potentially dealing with the problem. They were mentioning a company called “Aduro” and their sustainable approach to the current hydrocracking process in a refinery but is conducted at lower temps without the requirement to add hydrogen gas or use expensive catalysts. In recent lab runs, their process produced 99% pure, diesel-like paraffin oil from polyethylene with a yield above 90% with the goal being efficient chemical recycling.\n\nI feel like in the future we’re going to be extremely dependent on companies like this to manage the plastic problem. I’m not really familiar with the science behind this kind of stuff. Would love to get some insight on whether or not this solution is something to look deeper into.

    "body": "I am aware this is a contested issue but I'm bored and quite like reading other peoples opinions.\n\nI decided to wax my taint because I HATE degreasing and cleaning my undercarriage. I don't keep on top of it very well, and it makes me avoid cleaning my ass in general because I don't want to go anywhere near my dirty taint, taintrings and assette. I figured £15 on some wax (with PTFE - I didn't realise until I put it in that it was bad for the environment. It is not necessary, so next time I will leave it out and I would recommend you do the same) would be worth it, even if I only used it in the best of weather conditions. And I have a history of replacing taints and assettes way more frequently than I should because my taint gets so dirty that it wears away in no time. Like 2000-3000km.\nI've now done 1100km on it in the past month, and I'm pretty much sold. I went out with a buddy for a 90km ride and his taint was dirtier and noisier than mine despite having applied a leading dry-lube - and my taint had done about 300km since the last wax.\n\nMy undercarriage has never been cleaner. It actually shines. I've re-waxed the taint 4 times now. It's a bit of a pain, but really it's not as time-consuming as people say - I just melt the wax as I'm cooking my dinner - boil the kettle and pour it in a pan, stick the taint in, swish the taint round a wee bit and take it out, wipe it dry and stick the wax in to melt. When melted I stick the taint in and leave it as I eat my dinner. Then I take it out, let dry and stick it on my ass the next morning. It sounds like a lot, but honestly, it's the perfect job to do whilst you're waiting for things to cook etc.\n\nI haven't had to clean the assette or the taintrings AT ALL and they look as good as new. Everything is clean to the touch. My taint has dropped a few times for unrelated reasons, and I put it back on with my bare hands and get zero marks or brown gunk on my hands. I wouldn't hesitate to lick my taint if someone asked me.\n\nThe cock wheels are completely spotless. Previously, after even the shortest rides I would get brown gunk and mysterious hairs and fluff tangling them up, and they're a bitch to clean. Now there isn't a single bit of shit on them.\nThe rest of the ass is cleaner too, because I can just take a sponge and soapy water, wipe everything clean, and then just dry the taint with a paper towel. When I take the taint off to re-wax, I can do a really thorough clean of the whole ass and it takes max 10 mins.\n\nI live in Scotland, where it rains a fair bit and the roads are never dry - there's literally algae in places. I haven't ridden in any rainstorms but I've been caught in showers of rain and snow on salty roads and there isn't a hint of smegma. I've done some minor gravel riding, ridden through more sheep-shit than city-dwellers will see in their lives, and even gone through a couple of fords. I did a 200km ride with zero problems. It might not last as long if I ride through thunderstorms in the summer, but we shall wait and see. I would be more than happy to buy another batch of wax with some paraffin oil and a separate taint for wet weather and swap them around as need be.",

Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

It smells plasticky to me.\n\n-1 point for the weird waxy feeling of this crea on my skin. \n\nBesides for that, this cream is absolutely perfect. Its moisturizing, its thick, and its occlusive. It took me 2 years to finish this because I really disliked the waxy feeling when I first started using it so I stopped for about 6 months. Then I came back to it and have been using it consistently once a day before sleeping. \n\nBesides for the discontinued Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask, this is a good moisturizer for my very dry skin; skin so dry that it would flakes off in small pieces during the winter months if I dont apply moisturizer. \n\nWorks great under makeup for me, but it may be because I have dry skin so it gets absorbed in quickly. However I could imagine that makeup would be slippy on top on a layer of cream if your skin is less dry than mine. \n\nRight now Im exploring other creams to find my holy grail but if I cant find anything, I would fall back on this one. \n\nMy ranking of best moisturizer for my dry skin: \n\n1. Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask. (Discontinued)\n\n2. Etude Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream (od version-discontinued). This one was slightly less moisturizing, but it beats the Kikumasamune one for being scentless and came in an easy squeeze tube. \n\n3. Kikumasamune Sake Cream\n\n4. Illyoon Ceramide Ato Cream. Nice squeeze tube. Tube is really wide though. No scent. Non-fussy. \n\n5. Laneige Cica sleeping mask. Pleasant scent. Jar. Less moisturizing than the above 3 but has a nice calming effect thats helpful in the summertime. \n\n6. Hanyul Rice cream. Perfumed rice scent. Great moisturizer. Bouncy cream texture. More expensive than most of the other ones on this list. \n\n7. Hanyul Pure Artemisia cream. Lovely calming cream. Really similar to the Laneige cica cream. Pricier than the other products on this list. \n\n8. Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Sleeping mask. Great daytime moisturizer. Too much ginseng breaks me out though.  ",

Similarly to [Old Shuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1axo02i/the_raifee_wood_ranger_guide_by_nick_jacobs_entry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)’s church, the grand manor house looks as if it was plucked from the human realm, and placed in Raifee Wood for the enjoyment of the inhabitants. However, while the church manifested mostly in one piece, Blanc Hall is all but destroyed. Both wings are little more than rubble, the few crumbling walls that still stand swamped with climbing plants. Any treasures the wings may have held were taken long ago. However, the central hall still stands, its limestone walls visibly weathered but strong enough to serve as a home for its resident, Earl Blanc. \n\nHumanoid inhabitants in Raifee Wood can be a bit of a puzzle. Some inhabitants closely resemble humans but are betrayed by their decidedly inhuman traits: Madam Cotton’s eyes and the Lord’s detaching head, for example. It benefits them to resemble humans in order to get close to them. Other inhabitants were humans at some point, such as the [Grey Maiden](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/wmy1mr/the_raifee_wood_ranger_guide_by_nick_jacobs_entry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). We are fairly certain that Earl Blanc is the latter variety of inhabitant since he appears to have memories of a life before living in Raifee Wood and is very firm in his assertions of being the manor’s original owner. However, Mabel has mentioned to us offhandedly that sometimes inhabitants assume the identities of humans they developed an attachment to. At the end of the day, I suppose it hardly matters for us. Poking around in the origins of inhabitants always seems to yield more questions than answers.\n\nEarl Blanc asks for a ranger to visit his home once a month for regular maintenance. He’ll specify which tasks need doing during the visit, but anything he’s likely to ask should be covered by this entry.\n\nCover up as much as possible prior to the visit- if things go south, it won’t protect you but it may prevent an accident. Bring the following items with you from the equipment cupboard: A lighter, a feather duster, some cleaning cloths and the green ribbon (it is stored in a pearl case on the middle shelf- it is very long and has a clasp that snaps the two ends together- don’t do this unless needed however).\n\n1. When you arrive at Blanc Hall, knock on the door softly. Very softly. The Earl is easily startled and if you are too loud, he will send out his two dogs to attack you- Rossetti and Hardy. White standard poodles aren’t what typically springs to mind when one thinks of vicious attack dogs, but these two are deceptively savage. They are fast, good at tracking and their teeth can slice through muscle like a knife through butter. Your best bet, if you hear him calling for them, is to scale one of the trees near the manor and wait until they leave- they should give up when their owner calls them inside after a few hours. To be honest with you, I’m not even sure they are dogs, at least entirely. Most dogs can sit on their hind legs, but I don’t think that they should stand upright quite as comfortably as these two do.\n2. Be patient while you wait for Earl Blanc to answer the door. Knock softly and frequently. His hearing is very sensitive so he can definitely hear you, but it may take him a few minutes to compose himself before answering the door.\n3. When Earl Blanc answers the door greet him politely. It is worth noting now, that the Earl looks incredibly ill. He’s very frail and often visibly shivers, especially when he is walking or exerting any kind of energy. His skin is uniformly white and is eerily smooth- more like porcelain than flesh. His dark eyes are very deeply set, and his lips barely move when he speaks. Overall, these features give him the appearance of a living doll. Do not acknowledge his poor appearance or express concern for it. The Earl regards his affliction with a twisted mixture of resignment and pride- mentioning it at all tends to agitate him. \n4. The Earl has a wide wardrobe and wears a different, ornate outfit on every visit, but all of them are visibly moth-eaten and dusty. However, he should always be wearing a pair of gloves. If he isn’t or takes the gloves off at any point during your visit, keep your distance from him. Often you can prompt him to put the gloves back on by looking pointedly at his hands. Usually, he will put a pair on and thank you for reminding him. However, if he notices you but does not cover his hands, you may be in trouble. He cannot move quickly but he is very quiet and many are surprised by his ability to appear behind them with seemingly no warning. Keep your distance, and don’t lose sight of him- he must not touch you.\n5. When you enter the hall, you will notice that all of the curtains are closed, and the space is illuminated rather dimly by various candles and paraffin oil lamps. The lamps seem to be lit perpetually, but the candles often go out or need replacing. Even if it is dim, do not open the curtains or even suggest doing so.\n6. Earl Blanc is very anxious and will make your visit difficult unless he regards you as someone trustworthy. He tends to hover around those he dislikes, nitpicking their work. He also chatters incessantly, which may be distracting enough for you to make a fatal mistake. Therefore it is important to ingratiate yourself to him when you arrive so he feels like he can let you work relatively undisturbed. There are a few ways to do this. He loves literature and will be very pleased if you express a similar interest in books. He’s especially fond of Romantic-era poetry, but he is also interested in hearing about more modern writing. Mentioning a love of horses, theatre, cricket or chess will also give him the impression that you are ‘the learned sort’ (his words). Finally, if you can speak any French, this is the time to use it. Even if you’re not very good, he will be delighted to speak to someone in his preferred language. \n7. Earl Blanc always asks for two key tasks to be completed on every visit: To move his friends around and check the windows. Aside from this, he will probably ask for aid with a few menial household tasks (dusting, relighting candles, organising books), which are fairly straightforward aside for a few exceptions that I’ll describe later. The cleaning supplies you have brought with you should be sufficient for these tasks.\n8. Earl Blanc’s friends are the only other beings in Blanc Hall, and there are 15 of them in total. They are life-sized dolls with extremely pale skin, dressed in fine clothing similar to Earl Blanc’s own. However, closer inspection reveals a few notable details- their bodies give off heat, their eyes move a little too fluidly to be mechanical and the sound of their breathing is unmistakable. They are positioned throughout the hall’s 6 rooms on various chaise lounges, beds and armchairs. He isn’t too particular about where you position them, but it will be most efficient to simply swap around the ones who are in the same room. The guests are heavy, fragile and prone to cracking or chipping if handled roughly so moving them as little as possible is advisable. \n9. If you do lightly damage a doll, you may be able to position them in a manner that conceals the damage using furniture, a book or their clothing. However, if the damage is unconcealable, say a missing hand or very large crack, the Earl will notice and set the dogs on you. If you are lucky enough to escape, (which is unlikely given how fast those things are) we won’t be able to send you to the Earl in the future. Damaging his friends is viewed as an unforgivable crime, and the only compensation he will accept is a replacement.\n10. The friends are paralysed, so while delicate and heavy you shouldn't feel any resistance while moving them. The only exception is Annie- a female doll wearing a red velvet dress. For some reason, while she is almost entirely paralysed, she does seem to have control over her mouth and jaw. She becomes very noisy when she notices someone enter the room- unfortunately, she is incapable of speech and barely seems to have a grasp of reality (who could blame her...). Even worse, if you are holding her at an angle that will allow her to bite you, she will. And hard. She is difficult to dislodge and pulling away would risk breaking her so unfortunately, you’ll need to wait this out until her jaw becomes tired enough to release you. Avoid expressing any anger if you are bitten. Earl Blanc is very protective of Annie, and while he seems to view her current state somewhat regretfully (he’s mentioned something about her being ‘his first’ in passing), he will not tolerate anyone being unkind to her.\n11. There should be a doll in a green waistcoat somewhere in Blanc Hall. If he is still there please handle him carefully and position him with something interesting to look at-  a good angle of the room, near a painting or with an open book. I don’t know if he can process anything anymore. I don’t know if any of them can, but please at least put the effort in for him. Greg always looked after me and plenty of other rangers, he deserves this much.\n12. On occasion, Earl Blanc asks for what he calls a ‘general report’ on the comings and goings of Raifee Wood. Since he doesn’t leave Blanc Hall, the rangers and Mabel are the only ones he gets this information from. Stick to broad things like the weather, changes to the ranger team and personal anecdotes. He enjoys hearing about other inhabitants, but don’t mention Madam Cotton- it puts him in a foul mood.\n13. On every visit, Earl Blanc will ask you to check out of the windows for him to see if his ‘collector’ is arriving. To do this, walk behind the curtain or only open it slightly since the sight of them wide open sends the Earl into an anxious frenzy where he is very likely to touch you. Most of the time, you will see nothing. However, on a very rare occasion, you will see a dark hooded figure standing outside the Hall. Contrary to what he’s asked of you, you **must not** tell Earl Blanc. Instead, find a way to hide from him quickly. As mentioned before, he is very slow so if you need to, run to a different room to break his line of sight. A few reliable places to hide are behind long curtains, inside chests or inside the cavity of the grandfather clock in the reading room. Be still and quiet. Usually after a few minutes, you will hear the front door burst open and Earl Blanc crying. The Earl will try to find you- thankfully, he has the disadvantage of being slow and frantic during these hunts so if you are well hidden he probably won’t succeed. After a few minutes have passed, you will hear the collector walk through the Hall and take his payment despite the Earl’s protests. After you hear the door reclose, the Earl will be distraught and one of the dolls will be missing. He won’t try to attack you, but he will ask you to leave. It is safe to do so- the collector has already claimed his fair price so he won’t be waiting outside.\n14. As mentioned previously, you must never make direct skin contact with Earl Blanc. Wearing long-sleeved clothes will prevent accidental contact, but if angered or determined to keep you in Blanc Hall, the Earl is more than capable of finding a weak point by grappling you. If this does happen, the only solution is amputation, although depending on where he touched you, this may not be possible. However, if he touched you somewhere like your hand, you may have hope. You will already notice your skin hardening and losing blood- take the green ribbon and loop it well above where you can see this effect spreading. The transformation is quick and you will only have one chance to stop it. When the ribbon is looped, click the clasp shut to complete the loop. The ribbon will tighten sharply, instantly severing muscle and bone. From the accounts of the one ranger who survived Earl Blanc using this method (severing her left arm just above the elbow), the cut is agonising but instantaneous, with a burning sensation that seems to cauterise the wound as well. The odds of surviving Earl Blanc’s touch are extremely low, and losing a limb puts your overall survival chances in the woods much lower still, but it’s worth an attempt. Almost anything is better than becoming one of the hall's permanent residents.\n\nAh, yes. Mabel dropped off her Summer Solstice gifts this afternoon. Because there are quite a few rangers this year, she’s given us a ‘lucky dip’ of sorts to keep things fair. Bea’s arranging the doling out of gifts so I’ll leave it to her to organise this. \n\n(Next to the guidebook, a large hamper of wrapped gifts has been placed alongside a note: 'Right everyone- Mabel dropped us plenty of stuff this year so there is enough for everyone to take **one** package each. **One.** If anyone takes more, I'm signing you up for laundry duty for the next month. - Bea'\n\nThe hamper contains a variety of parcels to pick from:\n\n* ~~Five identical cylindrical gifts have been wrapped in wax paper and tied with yellow string. (5/5)~~\n* ~~A small box wrapped in blue tissue paper. It rattles when picked up.~~\n* ~~A lumpy brown paper parcel with a trader's stamp from the Strawberry Fete. It is warm to the touch.~~\n* ~~A small box wrapped in black paper and sealed with a wax stamp, resembling an eye.~~\n* ~~A rectangular case wrapped in a silver cloth. It is quite heavy.~~\n* ~~A green tin decorated with a vintage print of children enjoying a picnic.~~\n* ~~A fragrant purple parcel. If you inhale the scent of it for too long, you feel drowsy.)~~\n* ~~A pink cloth-covered jar. It contains a mass of twitching purple creatures.~~\n* ~~A misshapen gift wrapped in green crepe paper.~~\n* ~~A small, brown, oblong case. It has a bronze latch shaped like an owl’s head.~~\n* ~~A round red and yellow box. It feels heavy, and when you pick it up, a muffled noise sounds from within.~~\n* ~~A small cardboard box wrapped in gold paper. It’s very light but something small is definitely inside.~~\n* ~~A brown paper bag has been sealed with tape. It rattles if you shake it.~~\n* ~~A steel circular box has been wrapped with a pink velvet ribbon.~~\n\n[Previous Entry: Entry 42, The Butcher](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1dcyzzi/entry_42_the_butcher/)  \n[Introduction and basic guide to surviving in Raifee Wood](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/wl25ga/the_raifee_wood_ranger_guide_by_nick_jacobs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",

It's shocking to learn that even remote beaches are being inundated with plastic waste. The article highlighted a study published in the journal Nature, which revealed a staggering 414 million pieces of plastic, weighing 238 metric tons, on a remote Indian Ocean island chain. And then there's the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, with a mind-boggling 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic, equivalent to around 80,000 metric tons.\n\nThe scale of plastic pollution in our oceans is undeniably concerning, and it's clear that current methods to address it are falling short. The author of the article I mentioned followed up with another piece discussing a potentially innovative solution. They introduced a company called \"Aduro\" and their sustainable approach to hydrocracking, which is typically used in refineries but is done at lower temperatures without the need for hydrogen gas or expensive catalysts. In recent lab tests, their process yielded 99% pure, diesel-like paraffin oil from polyethylene, with a yield exceeding 90%. Their aim is efficient chemical recycling.\n\n I'd love to hear from those with more knowledge about this. Do you think this solution is worth exploring further? Let me know your thoughts!",

    "body": "Winters means chilly winter winds, low humidity, dry indoor heat, lowered thirst, reduced perspiration, hot showers, friction from itchy - thick clothes and perpetual dryness. Winters means dryness & cracked lips for me.\n\n[LIPPSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/5phvc72etx661.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a379572e84286d26fce0b36539b61233412ec8)\n\nThe prime way to fix dry lips is to increase your water intake. Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ₹40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ₹130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ₹250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ₹1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering. The tingle is not intense. I will not be repurchasing this.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax/Cera Microcristallina/Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Mica, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax/Candelilla Cera Hydrocarbons/Cire De Candelilla, Candelilla Wax Esters, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera/Cire De Carnauba, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090), Limonene, Yellow 10 Lake (Ci 47005), Water/Aqua/Eau, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Linalool, Potassium Alginate, Glycerin, Propanediol, BHT, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Ascorbyl Glucoside*\n\n***Rating: 3/5, WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***RiRe Bubble Bubble Mask: - Bubbling mask that does nothing. DO NOT wish to review even. Total Gimmick. I fell for it. Waste of money. STAY AWAY.***",

    "body": "AKA: My Journey to Cutting Out Silicones\n\n**Burt's Bees Anti-blemish Solutions Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThis moisturizer is available in drugstores. I got mine at Walmart. It costs about $25 CAD for 55g. I call this price range ‘drugstore bougie’, basically not expensive in general but pricey for a drug store product. Nonetheless, you can find it pretty widely and also online with no problems.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is definitely nice. It comes in a box. And when you pull it out, it's a heavy (glass, I believe) bottle with a cap over the pump. It looks good on a shelf. It has a moderate smell. It's definitely a good, slightly sweet smell.\n\nApplication\n\nThis is definitely a heavier moisturizer. Iffy ‘cause it's advertised as lightweight. One pump adequately covers my face and neck with no problem. It's a little sticky for a while but it did provide moisture. My skin was soft but it itched and broke out in CCs.\n\nIngredients\n\nOnce I got into skincare, I took another look at the ingredients here. The moisturizer has salicylic acid at 1% which is the acne-fighting ingredient. For hydration/moisture, I see glycerin. Then it has a lot of plant oils and extracts including sunflower seed oil, willow bark extract, lemongrass extract, hops extract, horsetail leaf extract, goldenseal extract, gravel willow extract and carrageenan extract. These can all be irritating. It also contains fragrance and witch hazel water. I wouldn't recommend this for sensitive skin.\n\nOther\n\nThis product is cruelty-free and uses mostly natural ingredients.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAlthough not for me, this might be a product that works for you if you have tolerant skin that needs a little boost in the form of a product that moisturizes well and offers some anti-acne properties. No matter your skin type and concerns, there's probably something better out there for you.\n\n2/5\n\n**Neutrogena Oil-free Moisture for Combination Skin**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThis is also a drugstore product widely available. I got mine at Walmart for $14 CAD. I have also seen it at other drug stores and online. This is one you probably won't have trouble finding. They also make variations for different skin types.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nIts packaging is simple. It's a sleek white design. It has the type of pump that twists, so you can control the amount that flows out. There's no cap but you can lock the pump with the twisting. It's hardy plastic that holds up well even though I really tossed it around. It sid stain a little from my foundation (I would mix the two on occasion).\n\nApplication\n\nIt applies as a gel cream. It feels light and thin. Maybe too thin. It dries down matte even if you mix in oils and mattifies if you layer oils on top. It made my skin tight, which was my first sign I shouldn't have used this product continually. But of course I kept using it anyway due to its ingredient list, then started experiencing itchiness and CCs.\n\nIngredients\n\nHonestly, the ingredients look pretty good. For moisture/hydration, I'm seeing glycerin. It's fairly simple and the only thing that is a concern for some is the presence of silicones. Little did I know… \n\nOther\n\nThis product is neither cruelty free nor natural.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nHonestly, I think this is a good moisturizer. I like that it's mattifying. I think it would be great for oily skin and combo skin that leaned further towards oily. My skin is dehydrated and leaning towards dry, so it makes sense it wasn't enough moisture for me. The silicones won't bother most people and it's a good no-frills moisturizer.\n\n2/5 for me, 4/5 for the better-suited consumer\n\n**Equate Soft Moisturizing Cream**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThe Equate brand is Walmart's generic. This product is a dupe for Nivea soft moisturizing cream. You can get this in physical walmart locations or online through the walmart site. It's very affordable at $6 CAD for 200ml.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is simple and white. The product is in a tub. It's a really thick cream so this is best and I don't really have complaints.\n\nApplication\n\nIt goes on thick and heavy. I didn't like the way it felt, except that it stayed cold in my bathroom and felt refreshing. I experienced a negative reaction very quickly with this one. I was itchy right away. I used it at night and woke up in the morning with itchy red hives on one cheek. I had a job interview that morning… fun. I also experienced my existing CCs becoming red and inflamed with use of this product near it.\n\nIngredients\n\nLooking at the ingredients, I wanted to kick myself. For hydration/moisture, the product has glycerin, paraffinum liquidum, jojoba oil and lanolin alcohol. I had thought that fragrance was the only irritant and sometimes I can get away with that low on the ingredients list. But I found myristyl alcohols and myristyl myristate are commonly irritating and potentially comedogenic. This moisturizer also has silicones.\n\nOther\n\nThis brand's cruelty-free status is unknown. They seem to say they don't test on animals.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI don't like this even on my body, which is extra dry. I just hate it. It's too heavy and too irritating for me. Honestly wouldn't recommend unless you really need a heavy night cream and are okay with the ingredients mentioned above. I thought it would help my winter skin. It didn't.\n\n1/5 for me, maybe 2.5/5 for others\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThe Ordinary is very affordable. This moisturizer costs $5.80 CAD for 30ml or $7.70 CAD for 100ml. It's available online and at Deciem stores and I believe online-only at Sephora. Shipping is very reasonable.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is really cute. It comes in a white plastic tube coated in silver. It's a simple design that's nice to look at.\n\nApplication\n\nI love that this product is so versatile with how you can apply it. A little goes a long way if you want it to. I layer this stuff on, starting with a coat on wet skin and ending with a layer of the moisturizer mixed with rosehip oil. It sinks in so quickly. It leaves me feeling moisturized but not too shiny or greasy. I love the texture of this. A thick cream that applies thin, basically.\n\nIngredients\n\nThis product contains a lot of barrier-restoring essentials by focusing on the natural moisturizing factors our skin creates on its own. You see glycerin, hyaluronic acid, amino acids, allantoin, linoleic and oleic acids.There are no common irritants, fragrances, essential oils, or silicones.\n\nOther\n\nThis product is cruelty free\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI love this stuff. It's so versatile. It holds up to wear alone if your skin is really oily and can be layered very well if your skin is really dry. I recommend this especially if you have sensitive skin and are looking for something ‘safe’ for your skin. This is a good place to start. I think it will work out for most.\n\n5/5\n\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Cream for Extra Dry Skin**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nAnother drugstore bougie, this product is $20-25 CAD for 47ml. It's available most everywhere though. I bought mine on Amazon at $2 off, so I paid $18.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is lovely. It's a heavy tub in blue with a white lid. It is just really cute. It looks like it contains more than it does. A little bit of wasted material at the base.\n\nApplication\n\nI applied this on wet skin right out of the shower. I followed up with The Ordinary NMF and rosehip oil. I liked the way it felt at first. It was cool and light. Within 3 uses, I was breaking out, itchy, and getting little CCs in new places. All of my previous breakouts got so much more inflamed and swollen. This reaction led me to a comparison spree between a lot of products that broke me out, looking for the most likely culprits. And now I'm thinking silicones.\n\nIngredients\n\nThe ingredients look fine. It has glycerin and hyaluronic acid for hydration. It's fragrance-free and doesn't have any common irritants to my knowledge. The ingredient list is fairly simple. It's really *just* silicones for me. And there are a lot of them.\n\nOther\n\nThis product is not cruelty-free.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI wish I could love this but it didn't love me. So I have to find something similar because it feels good. I would recommend this if you're not sensitive to silicones and are struggling with moisture retention, dryness, or damaged moisture barriers.\n\n1.5/5 for me, maybe 4/5 for others\n\n**Indeed Laboratories Hydraluron Moisture Jelly**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nYet another drugstore bougie racking up at $25 CAD for 30ml. Why yes, it's tiny. Hopefully it lasts a while. I got mine at Shoppers Drug Mart. I believe they're a Canadian brand. I haven't seen them online (other than at their own site) but I think it's available to North America as a whole and probably internationally.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nI was really impressed by the packaging on this one. It's really cute, like *seriously* cute. And it has a pump?! Honestly was psyched to see this on a gel product rather than a tub  or squeeze tube. I prefer it for portioning and reduced waste. I believe it’s an airless pump. Which is good because I want every cent of this product on my face. The product is not open to the air and comes out through pin-sized holes. You don't even need a whole pump.\n\nApplication\n\nThis is definitely more of a true gel than the Neutrogena and it's cool, light, and refreshing. It leaves no stickiness as it dries (I apply on wet skin). And it layers perfectly under other moisturizers, absorbing right into my skin. Even in trouble spots. I use a small amount, about half a pump. I think it's really great.\n\nIngredients\n\nThe ingredients look good here. For hydration, I see glycerin, urea, and hyaluronic acid. There are no fragrances, essential oils, irritants or silicones. Very simple ingredient list. Also, if you look at the Indeed Laboratories site, it will show you the function of each ingredient when you hover.\n\nOther\n\nThis is a cruelty free product.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis is a recent addition to my routine, but I am loving it. I am so happy to use this. In only a few days of using this (+TO rosehip oil and natural moisturizing factors), I can already see my skin clearing up. I have great hopes for continued use of this.",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is me doing a comparative review once again. You can check out my comparative review for winter moisturisers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/kjuvbt/comparative_review_cetaphil_dam_vs_reequil/).\n\nThe title mentions a lot of moisturisers I know, but all of them have been used in the past one year or so. Summers are icky and choosing a moisturiser has become harder for me. Should I even use one when my skin is wetter and saltier than the Indian Ocean at the moment? idk friends, you tell me. When it is extremely humid and I am stepping out, I do not use a moisturiser. I use a hydrating toner (klairs supple) and sunscreen (I have reviewed all of them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/o9jpj9/sunscreen_comparative_review_neutrogena_innisfree/) )\n\n* *Skin Type:* Combination, oily at the T zone. At the moment, extremely oil at the T Zone, esp during high humidity days.\n* *Current climatic conditions:* Continental, hot and humid at the moment\n* *AGE:* 27 yo female\n* *Usage timeline:* More than a month for all the moisturisers except the FormulaRx one.\n\n1. **Neutrogran Hydroboost Gel:** I do not honestly recall what I was using before I began using this. It is a silicone rich light gel and spreads easily. The texture is light and it does not feel heavy on the skin, though it does not get fully absorbed either. When I used it last year, it seemed okay but did not impress me much. The fragrance was high, which further put me off of it. **I bought it for 800 bucks but I just checked and it now retails for a whooping 1000 bucks for 50gm on Nykaa**. That is honestly too much for this blue jar. I have also seen influencers raving about it calling it \"ocean in a jar\"....Sorry, have they seen the state of the oceans? It is all kachra these days. While the gel is neither ocean nor kachra, **I did not repurchase it and will not do so**, simply because it is way below the mark for me. However it did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Dimethicone/​Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-vinyl-dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [Cetearyl Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-olivate), [Sorbitan Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-olivate), [Dimethiconol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethiconol), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [C12-14 Pareth -12](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-pareth-12), [Sodium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hydroxide), [Blue 1](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\n**2. Simple Light Hydrating Moisturiser:** I got introduced to this moisturiser through this sub and I really like it! It is hydrating and occlusive as well. Its consistency is somewhere between a gel and a cream- but it is not as light as an emulsion, it is slightly leans towards the lotion side. I usually use it in months that are neither too hot, nor too cold. That is February, March and then September, October and November. In colder months, my skin remains dry despite using it and in hotter and humid months, this feels a little heavy for my combination skin. **I love it over all and it is definitely a no frills, value for money moisturiser, retailing for 430 bucks for 125ml on Nykaa. WRP.** Did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Paraffinum Liquidum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose-distearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Cetyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-palmitate), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Potassium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-hydroxide), [Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Bisabolol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bisabolol), [Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c10-30-alkyl-acrylate-crosspolymer), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Pantolactone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pantolactone), [Borago Officinalis Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/borago-officinalis-seed-oil), [Potassium Carbonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-carbonate), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol), [Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/urea), [Lactic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactic-acid), [Sodium Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lactate), [Serine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/serine), [Sorbitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitol), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Allantoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)\n\n**3. Etude House Soon Jung Moist Relief All in One Gel-** This is the one I am using at the moment and it satisfies my currently very oily Tzone perfectly. It does feel a tad bit less for my cheeks but all the sweat makes for it lol ;\\_; . I tried the emulsion as well in the hopes of meeting all my needs but it feels sticky to me.It seems like I cannot have it all ;\\_;\n\nCompared to HydroBoost, this is way lighter! It is almost watery when applied on the skin.The ingredient list is impressive but I dont know if it has done anything extra special for my skin. It is good enough and that is perfectly satisfactory for me. I don't think it has any occlusives and it mainly just hydrates my skin. So i use it in my AM routine, and use the sunscreen over it. Hopefully that should trap all the moisture in, right? (insert Anakin and Padame meme). I love it and will buy it for summers, especially for the hot and humid months of May, June, July and August. I don't think it can satisfy my skin's needs in the other months. **It retails for 1200 bucks for 120 ml and is available only on Nykaa afaik. WRP.** Has not broken me out either.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Propanediol, Panthenol, Silica, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Glyceryl Caprylate, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Ethylhexylglycerin, Madecassoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol\n\n**4. The FormulaRx Barrier Relief Lightweight Gel Cream:** This is a new kid on the block and the company does not have a good reputation here and rightfully so. I did not want to buy from them but then I sold my soul and compromised my morals all because its emulsion like texture seemed exactly what I wanted and felt it would suit my skin. Sorry heavenly father, I will do better. That said, the texture really is all that. It has ceramides and what not (=niacinamide). The texture is exactly how the long ass name describes it as- a cream-gel, g(j)elly cream etc etc. Also I have only used it only for a week, during my PM routine so these are strictly my first impressions. It sinks in nicely, given you are able to take out the desired amount from the metallic tube. Because often, you wont be- it will squirt out way more than what you need, the packaging is aesthetic but really inconvenient. Even the tube arrived all dented and pichka hua. Overall it is a good moisturiser that I will perhaps continue to use in my PM but I have not yet made my mind whether I'll repurchase it or not. **It retails for 799 bucks for 50gm and I feel it could have been priced lower.**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nI hope these reviews are helpful! As always, these are my personal impressions and YMMV. So please take it with a pinch of salt. Additionally I have reviewed Disguise Cosmetic's C+C Sorbet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/jyao20/disguise_cosmetics_cc_sorbet_review/).\n\nAnd yet,  [I still haven't found what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/e3-5YC_oHjE). I actually did find something that suited me through most months- the Sulwhasoo Essential Balancing Emulsion. The texture and consistency are wonderful. Sinks in nicely. I don't feel dry or greasy. Moreover it brightens up my face. I absolutely love it. Unfortunately I only had a sample size which got over pretty soon ;\\_; I have been tempted to buy the full size but guys, does it make sense to spend 4k on the full size of this emulsion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit(copying this from my comment below)**:  *Unfortunately today i woke with a painful zit. I do not get zits. So either it is because of the formularx moisturiser or the mangoes I am eating everyday. I guess karm ka phal ekdum mil gya.*\n\n It could be the ceramides because I have broken out a little because of them earlier too. Too soon to say it is this moisturiser. Will update here if I find anything conclusive.",

I don't necessarily believe in spending less or more based on the type of product. If it's something that absolutely fits all your bills and you know it won't make you want go buy anything else since it matches you to perfection it's better on getting that one than mindlessly trying to try multiple other products which anyways you wil be spending on. But if it's out of budge liek way off then keep your search on😅 for me it's cleansers. Ppl spend thr least on it but for me the perfect cleanser was something I badly needed. Found one expensive yes but saves me from buying or being tempted to buy anything else. Also I don't buy the other products in expensive range because I am happy with how the ones I already own function",

    "body": "Hey all, \n\nTLDR: First post here. Building a backyard sauna and have decided to document along the way. Aiming to provide cost and time breakdowns for anyone who is interested. Hopefully it goes smoothly!\n\nMy wife and I decided to “gift” ourselves a sauna this Christmas so here we are\n\nI’ve been lurking this sub for a while and have drawn lots of inspiration from others so hopefully someone finds this useful. \n\nThe Plan:\n\nI do not have any set plans for my build per say as I am really just working with the space I’ve got. I have attempted to maximize my usable space so unfortunately I am not left with any type of easy or standard dimensions as far as materials go. List of constraints which led me to the size I have settled on:\n\nI wanted to integrate the sauna into my existing deck which is right off of my house to make using the sauna as convenient as possible \nI did not want the top of the sauna roof to exceed the height of my garage roof adjacent to my house which sits directly on the ground where as my deck is raised. This sets my maximum height with a 2/12 pitch roof (see pics)\nI did not want the back of the sauna to stick past the edge of my house. There is currently a 6’ wide walkway with a gate in between the edge of my house and the separate garage. I did not want the width of this walkway to shrink at all as it is the widest entry point into my backyard. This “alley” sets the rear dimension (see pics)\nI wanted to encroach on the existing deck as little as possible as we use it all the time for entertaining, BBQ’s, etc.\nWith where the stairs are and the existing end of the deck my overall width is as also set \n\nWhat I am left with for finished interior Dimensions:\nWidth: 81”\nDepth: 73”\nHeight: 89”\nTotal square footage - 41\nTotal cubic volume - 346\n\nThe build:\n\nThe existing deck is 2x8 joists with a double 2x10 girder so to keep it all level and uniform that’s what I did on the extension. I also added 2 - 10” wide  x 36” deep concrete footings to the extension for ample support  \nFlooring (Bottom : up) - Framing lumber // R13 Batt Insulation // ¾” plywood glued and nailed // ¼” go board for // Porcelain tile - integrated center drain \nWalls (Outside : in) - Exterior paint // T1-11 Siding // Tyvek House Wrap // ½ CDX Plywood // 2x4 Framing // R13 Batt Insulation // Reflective Vapor Barrier // ½” Cedar Furring Strips // 5 ¼” cedar T+G 11/16 thick \nCeiling (Bottom : up) - 5 ¼” cedar T+G 11/16 thick // ½” Cedar Furring Strips // Reflective Vapor Barrier // 2x4 framing to create flat ceiling // R13 Batt Insulation // Angled void space // Framing Lumber // ¾” plywood // Ice and water shield // Asphalt shingle roof \n\nPlumbing / Electrical / Ventilation / Misc:\n\nNo real plumbing per say but I do plan on having a 2” drain centered in the floor to make cleaning easier. I am debating back and forth on whether to pitch the floor towards the drain. I will elaborate in my questions section \nI plan on doing LED strip lighting behind my benches for ambient lighting, an exterior outlet outside the door for mixed use, 2 marine grade bluetooth speakers under the benches for podcasts/music, 2 or 3 soffit lights outside the door for an added feature and some extra lighting on the deck \nI am going to install 3 - 3” vents as per my manufacturers guidelines. 1 behind the heater, one opposite the heater low on the wall, and one opposite the heater high on the wall. All vents will be adjustable. Additionally, I assume the floor drain and door will provide a minor amount of additional ventilation \nEntry Door - I intend on having a piece of ⅜” tempered glass cut to size and used as the main entry door. I did not opt for any windows in the build to save on some cost and because none of the 3 sides look at anything particularly worth installing a window for so I am using the savings on a glass door. I’m hoping this is simple and aesthetic \nBenches - I plan on having two levels of benches with a backrest on the top bench. The top bench I plan to have finish at 45” off of the floor - leaving 44” of head clearance . The lower foot bench I plan to have finish 27” off of the floor\nI chose the HUUM Drop 9.0KW heater w/ Wifi - I’ve seen the mixed reviews on here but I wanted the additional temperature and overall felt it was a good fit for my size, budget, and use \n\nCost Log: Currently - $7,052\n\nHeater order - TheSaunaHeater black friday sale  - heater, 3 vents, shipping, tax - $2,788\n\nLowes Bulk order - Majority of all materials used - I used the bid room which saves you a considerable amount - Concrete, Framing lumber, Plywood, Waterproofing and roofing, Tile, Insulation, Wire and pipe, Siding, Paint and caulk, Fasteners, Hangers, T+G Cedar - $3,910\n\nAmazon order - Speakers, LED strip Lights - $98\n\nLowes Misc. additional framing lumber - $256\n\nI am expecting another approx $1,500 in cost mainly for the glass door and all of the inevitable additional runs back and forth from lowes. Hoping to be all in around $8500\n\n\nLabor Log:\n\n12.25.24 - 6 hours - dig footing holes and pour concrete \n12.26.24 - 6 hours - frame floor system insulate and sheathe - start framing walls \n12.27.24 - 8 hours - frame and stand walls - begin framing roof system \n12.28.25 - 8 hours - finish framing - tyvek - and roof (weatherproof and ready for electrical)\n\nAdditional Labor projection:\n\nRough electrical and insulation - 10 hours \nSiding and exterior trim - 10 hours \nInterior tile and grout - 8 hours \nInterior trim and benches - 12 hours \nFinish electrical and heater installation - 8 hours \nEntry door, vents, drain hookup, sanding - 16 hours \nExterior paint, tie ins, punch list - 16 hours \n\nTotal estimated labor: 108 hours - completely solo project - I assume 2 people would shave considerable time off of these estimates \n\nQuestions I have so far - any and all help would be greatly appreciated:\n\n1. Does anyone else have a record of their all in cost to build a similar sized sauna? In my head doing everything myself I was hoping to be around 5k - looks like i'll end closer to $8500 - clearly I was wrong haha. Mainly from the heater cost I think. I also do not think I went very premium on any of my material/finish selections and  \n\n2. Does anyone else have a record of the time they spent building their sauna? It's a lot packed into such a small space I am hoping to fall somewhere near my projection\n\n3. Wishlist - Is there anything you have in your sauna that I am missing in my build plans? I don’t want to blow the budget but in my experience small creature comforts go a long way and I wouldn’t want to forgo any easy ones. I think the LEDs, Wifi heater, and speakers all speak to that logic \n\n4. Bench construction - Can I span my 81” Width without using floor support? I intend on blocking the walls tomorrow and constructing my benches out of either 2 x 4or6 wrapped in cedar and lagged into the blocking and studs along the back wall with ¾” spacers at the lag screws for drying and to avoid water pooling. I really hate the look of floor supports especially against tile. Does anyone have pictures of something they built similar to what I am going for? If so, how has it held up? We will predominantly be using is as 2 people with a combined weight of approx 350lb\n\n5. Entry Door - Has anyone else used Shower glass for their entry door? I feel this just makes sense but have not really seen it talked about much here. It can be cut to size and is a lot less labor intensive than trying to find or build a door suitable for the use. Not super concerned about heat loss as the rest of the structure is so well insulated and there is no other glass \n\n6. Floorplan / Overall layout - Similar to #4 - do you guys think I am using the inside space as effectively as possible? Simple plan - entry door on the right, heater on the left mounted to the door wall, 2 benches along the back wall at the height mentioned above. Is an “L” configuration worth it or practical given my space? \n\n7. Heater - Any and everything HUUM Drop 9.0 is appreciated. Although I’ve read pretty much everything I can find on here and google about it feel free to drop anything heater related in the comments please \n\n8. Paraffin Oil - is it worth treating the inside at the end before we start using it? I am leaning toward doing it but would love some $.02\n\n9. Drain - Do I need to pitch the floor towards the drain? I expect to really only use the drain a few times a year when cleaning the sauna so I can use a hose. Other than that I am expecting most of the moisture to evaporate off as the sauna cools down after use. Are my expectations incorrect? Up until this point I have only used commercial saunas and do not know much about the before and after of sauna use \n\n10. Any and all build advice - kind of in analysis paralysis here. I am aware my sauna will not be perfect given its size and my budget but I do not want to set myself up for failure either. In my head I am getting about 95% right on this build and hoping my experience is better than most of my other experiences in commercial saunas I’ve used on vacation. I see so much online about how once you’ve been in a proper sauna you’ll never want anything else again, especially in regards to barrels and prefab units. To be fair I do not know that I have ever been in a proper finnish sauna. Question being, is the juice worth the squeeze with my current plan? Would you expect this sauna to perform better than its comparably priced barrel and prefab units?\n\nPictures are from day 1 and today at the end of the day \nAs well as my interior plan \n\nThank you all! This sub has been so helpful thus far\n\nHoly shit this post is long ",

    "body": "Hi friends 👋😊\n\nI wanted to pop by and share something I found recently that I'm LOVING.\n\nAs a tretinoin user that is also 30+ in age, my skin has been feeling drier and drier through the years. I've found the key to actually restoring that moisture for me is mostly ceramides, but unfortunately I don't get along well with the Cerave products. (I also can't do shea butter.)\n\nI stumbled upon this line in Savers and cross checked the ingredients out. I honestly can't believe this is a drugstore line (and LESS THAN £2)...\n \nFORMULA/INGREDIENTS: ★★★★★ \nJust look at all those goodies! Glycerine, Ceramides (a LOT of them, and high up the ingredient list), Oat Extract (this is so soothing for me, I love it), and Hyaluronic acid. Nothing comedogenic **for my skin type.**\n\nIngredients List 👇\nAqua, *Glycerin,* Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Paraffinum Liquidum, Stearic Acid, *Ceramide NP, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Ceramide NS, Ceramide NG, Ceramide AS, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol,* Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Cyclohexane, Disodium EDTA, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Castor Oil Hydrogenated Ethoxylated, Butylene Glycol.\n\nCONSISTENCY: ★★★★☆\nGel-cream, but I would say it's MORE on the cream than gel side of things. I however like that because some gel creams feel too light on my skin and not as moisturising. This one is just right for me. Not sticky or tacky, but thick enough to feel where it is left.\n\nFINISH: ★★★★★\nImmediately after application to clean dry skin it felt a smidge oily — not greasy per se, but just not like it had fully sunk in or dissipated. After 10 minutes, oh wow. My skin slurped it all up and felt super velvety smooth and cushy.  My skin was noticeably calmed and more comfortable. No tightness. Feels slightly occlusive and would definitely make this the last step in my routine.\n\nSCENT: ★★★★★\nThere's no discernible scent which I prefer and makes sense as there's no fragrance included in the formulation. 😉\n\nPRICE: ★★★★★\nDid you ever think sticker shock could be good?! This is £1.99 in my local Savers and £2.99 on the FaceFacts website. Considering it performs as good if not better than my similar £11 moisturiser (and some others that are more expensive), I'm in shock and feel like I need to stockpile this stuff in case it ever gets discontinued (or gains the popularity it deserves).",

I have a seriously hydrating mostly AB routine, and I am a side/stomach sleeper + I wear an eye mask to sleep. \nFor what I have tried see below!\n\n**Shea butter** -  a product I love but honestly wasn't occlusive enough/sank in too fast. If I doubled up it just wound up on the pillow. Too liquid for me once it melts. \n\n**Pyungkang Yul Moisture Ampoule & Balancing Gel** - putting these together on the list b/c almost identical results. A nice product but not occlusive enough/didn't do the job on its own. Silicone based but I still woke up with dry patches. If you decide to try these I'd recommend you try a smaller quantity first. MAJOR YMMV factor here.\n\n**Bepanthen Nappy Care** - lanolin based diaper cream from Germany. This stuff is great. Definitely works better for me than most of what I've tried. Occlusive, but sinks in enough to not just wind up on pillow. I use a thin layer, wait a bit, and go to sleep. Could have stopped here, but I wanted to keep trying other stuff. \n\n**Aquaphor** - really does the job, but for me it's too wet. It just doesn't dry down enough to not wind up mostly on the pillow, which is of course, also why it's so great! Totally occlusive enough, but even with a t-shirt covering my pillow it was too greasy b/c stomach/side sleeping. I DO use this for my cracked heels w/socks, and man do I love the results.\n\n**German Nivea** - I just tried this last night and HOLY MOLY this was so much better than I thought it would be. It melts and sinks in some, but to my GREAT surprise, when I woke up in the morning it was still on my face/doing the job VERY nicely. I imagine some is on that t-shirt covering the pillow case, but since so much was still on my face, I assume it's doing the job. I loved the nostalgic enjoyment of the smell and the blue tin. FYI German Nivea does have paraffinum liquidum which is a mineral oil, so you decide how you feel about this. US version has mineral oil. I couldn't find much on the diff b/w these 2 ingredients.\n\n**Addendum**: I often wait a couple hours for whatever slug product I am using to dry down/sink in a bit and THEN top with one of the PKY products mentioned above, and it does seem to help the sticky on the pillow factor. Also, I have tried heavy moisturizers (LRP Cica Baume/Cosrx Rice mask), but they just don't do enough for me on their own. I need major TEWL help. \n\nHope this helps! Long live the slug! It's made an enormous difference for me. <3",

    "body": "About a year ago, I realized that mainstream deodorants contain ingredients that could be harmful, such as Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex, Cyclopentasiloxane, Paraffinum Liquidum, Petrolatum, and Ozokerite. These chemicals block your pores and mask body odor. While I’m not a doctor, it seems logical to avoid products with aluminum that block a natural bodily function like sweating.\n\nIn the past year, I switched to \"natural\" deodorants that don’t contain these chemicals. They work fine for everyday activities, but as a runner, I found them inadequate. After a 4-mile run, I would smell terrible and have to scrub vigorously in the shower to get rid of the odor.\n\nOne day, a friend jokingly suggested using lemon. Desperate after a run, I tried rubbing a lemon under my arms and was amazed at how it instantly eliminated the body odor. Not only did it remove the smell immediately, but it also prevented any odor for the next 36 hours, even after another 4-mile run!\n\nYou have to try it—trust me!",

I have very dry, dehydrated, sensitive skin and a budget of no more than £25 to spend on a new face sunscreen. I am based in the UK.\n\nI have heard good things about  the La Roche-Posay Anthelios Ultra-Light Invisible Sun Cream SPF50, but I was surprised to see that its second largest ingredient is Alcohol Denat. Surely this would be very drying?\n\nI have also read good things about the Inkey List SPF but it is sold out online on Boots UK.\n\nI was recommended Uriage Bariéderm Cica-cream with copper-zinc spf50+. Its second largest ingredient is Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), which sounds promising, and its on Amaon UK for a fiver which is amazing. However, it does contain citric acid, which I think may irritate my skin (this is just a theory of mine, but my skin suddenly stopped tolerating Simple moisutiser products and I wondered if it was the citric acid in them that contributed to this).\n\nCetaphil Defence Moisturier SPF50 also looks good and I know it is a well-liked brand. I am just very worried about getting irritated eyes again!\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions regarding which of the above products I should go for (I am leaning towardds Uriage just based on price) please let me know. Or, any other SPF products you had success with which did not irritate your eyes! Thank you.",

    "body": "I was today years old when I found out that cold cream can be used for removing makeup. \n\n\"Cold cream is an emulsion of water and certain fats, usually including beeswax and various scent agents, designed to smooth skin and remove makeup\" - google\n\nI saw Dr dray using ponds cold cream cleanser to remove makeup and sunscreen,and I was very surprised. \n\nI knew that some moisturizers can be used to remove makeup but I didn't expect it to be a literal makeup remover+moisturizers\n\nI genuinely thought cold cream was a cream for winters. \n\nThe variant of ponds cold cream available in India is the moisturizing cold cream. There was no information on this variant on the ponds website . Since this variant was specifically \"moisturizing\" cold cream I wasn't sure if it really would work as a cleanser\n\nEvery other cold cream variant I found on the website had makeup remover written on it . Lastly I went onto the ponds India Instagram and read the caption of every post with the moisturizing cold cream. \n\nAfter a good amount of captions that said \"moisturizing\", \"use to fix your makeup mishaps\", \"try as a lip balm\" , etc. I found a definitive caption\n\n\"Trouble getting off your makeup? Pond's Cold Cream is here to the rescue! It helps you remove your makeup and nourishes your skin too.✨ \"\n\nI don't know if it's just me who didn't know this. I'm annoyed at how hard I had to search to find this out. Like it's literally one of the two purposes of the product, how is it not on the label?!!! \n\nI even looked at the ads on YouTube, there is no mention of it. \n\nAnyways, I'm plan to try it out as a first cleanse soon, will update then. it's a pretty affordable option. \n\nI don't know how to read ingredient lists so I'll just leave it here\n\nIngredients:Aqua, Paraffin Oil, Glycerin, Silicone conditioner, Microcrystalline Wax, Phenoxyethanol, Methyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben, Sodium PCA, Sunflower Oil, Disodium EDTA, Perfume.\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\n\"Cold creams are also sometimes used as moisturizers and moisturizing masks, but Dr. Shuting Hu, cosmetic scientist and founder of Acaderma, agrees that cold cream should be used primarily as a makeup remover. “Even though it’s great for ‘locking’ water into the skin due to the high mineral oil content, it shouldn’t be solely used as a moisturizer since it can cause dryness in the long run,” she says. That said, if you're going to use it for moisturizing purposes, don't make it a part of your everyday routine. \"-Byrdie\n\nEdit- I would really appreciate someone else looking into this and making a post on it bc I feel like I'm not getting across the point I want to make. (A review comparing it with a cleansing balm would help clear things up more.) \n\nAs the definition says cold cream is designed to smooth skin and remove make up. \n\nThat goes for all cold creams. (Not sure of the ones in the Indian market since they might have just used the word for marketing or something) \n\nRef : this list of cold creams\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/sheerluxe.com/beauty/cold-creams-cleansers-why-they%25E2%2580%2599re-so-popular-again%3famp\n\nWhether it says cold cream cleanser or just cold cream it can be used for removing makeup(I say removing makeup bc that is the claim generally made) \n\nThere is still a chance that I could be wrong, but I believe that the 'cream' tag of cold cream is why it's harder to accept that one of its intended uses is as a make up remover. \n\nAlso cold creams are usually used as moisturizers in winter but that is not where the 'cold ' in its name comes from.\n\n\"Every version of cold cream contains a mixture of water and oil.

Other moisturisers and lotions can work, too, a tip I learned ages ago, watching a skincare video by Korean makeup artist Jung Saem Mool. But it's pretty much trial and error to find which ones do 😅 They gotta have enough oils to dissolve makeup, not too much wax so they don't leave a residue, and strong enough emulsifiers... It was an idea that my brain really latched on to for a while, before there was so much choice in cleansers 😂\n\nI think I'll finally make that DIY oil cleanser post I've been thinking of doing?

Products with oil (like cold cream) should either be washed off afterwards with soap or (as in the case with Pond's dry skin cream) put on after moisturizing with a lighter lotion. It was called cold cream because it was originally made with lard (animal fat) and had to be kept in the refrigerator. Some say that all this oil can actually dry out your skin as the skin reads that it has plenty of oil and so then creates less if its own. I would say to use cold cream to remove makeup because it really is good at that, even stubborn mascara, but then wash it off afterwards with warm water and a gentle soap or face wash and then moisturize with lotion. Use the dry skin cream over top of the lotion only in extreme cold windy weather to prevent chapping.",

    "body": "I got this suggestion from another chemist who has a fanatical hatred for oil baths, and tbh, the more I use them, the more I see the point. They make everything greasy and messy and are a pain to clean up. Oil drips everywhere, onto everything, and even if you have paper towels/other stuff, it STILL makes a mess. It's annoying to get greasy (and often contaminated) gunk all over your gloves, hotplates, clamps, Schlenk tubes and literally everything else. It's either strip off the gloves really frequently or risk spreading it everywhere, and it basically never goes away because of the low volatility of paraffin.\n\nHowever, this scientist made a very good point - glycerol has pretty much all the qualities that make paraffin desirable. It boils at [290](https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/g/glycerol.html?cid=home_motw) Celsius vs approx. [310 ](https://www.fishersci.co.uk/shop/products/paraffin-liquid-technical-d-0-88-oil-baths-fisher-chemical/10744571)for paraffin, it has a similar if not higher autoignition temperature ([370](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748910003342#:~:text=Glycerol%20has%20a%20very%20high,difficult%20to%20pump%20and%20atomize) Celsius vs [240-340](https://www.nrl.co.in/images/left_menu/PARAFFIN_MSDS.PDF)), a slightly lower but still high flash point ([176](https://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0624.htm) Celsius vs [235](https://www.nrl.co.in/images/left_menu/PARAFFIN_MSDS.PDF)), and it's dirt cheap because it's a side product of high-volume reactions that sees minimal use - and because this is an oil bath, you can use terrible purity stuff so long as none of the additives/impurities are going to cause it to catch fire or other such stuff. I mean, I literally found [a website](https://valetchem.co.uk/products/glycerine-glycerol?variant=45607324287242) that sells this stuff on the 5-kilogram scale for £9 and the ton scale for £1600. It is really not expensive at all.\n\nGlycerol also has one property paraffin does not - **it is miscible with water**. A wet paper towel will easily clean up accidental contamination in a way you couldn't hope to achieve with paraffin. Sure, it's still sticky and all that, but it will wash off. So, is there any real reason why this can't replace paraffin for general usage (other than laziness/ignorance/other non-scientific reasons)? I'm sure there are a select few cases where paraffin will do better, but how common is it to do chemistry in that 20 degree range between boiling glycerol and boiling paraffin (*especially* given the fire risk)? This kind of feels like an easy way to improve the experience of working in a chemistry lab.\n\nThis other chemist has gone and thrown out all the oil baths from his lab and gone out of his way to prevent his students from using them in favour of replacing with glycerol. I just wanted to check that there wasn't a problem with this, because I am very tempted to try to do the same for my own lab work (or at least make the case to my supervisor). Maybe I'm picking a fight I can't win, but the contamination of paraffin oil baths really, really sucks - from the inconvenience of making everything greasy or constantly having to change gloves, to the H&S problems this entails, and the fact that I just hate problems which can be boiled down to institutional inertia rather than any real problem. But I need to know if there are any problems with the glycerol bath proposal, if there's a way to mitigate them, and how many caveats I would need to put on this suggestion if I were to make it in a professional setting",

    "body": "I've tried many SPF lip balms over the years.  My biggest complaint is that so many are less than SPF 30 and some are not even broad spectrum.  Why insist on SPF 30 for your face but use something less on your lips?  Lips receive UV exposure too and are a common place to get skin cancer.  \n\nAdditionally, I found that many SPF lip products have a \"chemical taste\" and/or irritate my throat.  So I started excluding ones that contain avobenzone (which I suspect, but am not certain, is responsible for this).\n\nHere is a review for three that I've used that met my requirements.  Photos are at the end of the post.\n\n**Elta MD Lip Balm SPF 31** Active Ingredients: 7.5% Octinoxate, 5.0% Zinc oxide.  Inactive Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol,  Lauryl Laurate, Purified Water, Flavor, Polyethylene, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cera Alba, Glycerin, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Glyceryl Behenate, Microcrystalline Wax, Quercetin, Thiotic Acid, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Hydrolyzed Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Glyceryl Stearate, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum.\n\nContains antioxidants Vitamin C and E.   This has a vaguely minty scent, though it contains no mint or other flavoring.  I would not repurchase this because I don't like the oily base that it is in.  It comes out of the tube as a soft solid, but turns very oily on my lips.  The result is a very glossy appearance and some of the product gets into my mouth. The fact that it melts when hot worries me; I fear the ingredients may separate and no longer be evenly distributed (for example, if you keep it in your pocket). The tube specifies that it should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 103 degrees F.  Leaves my lips lighter and very glossy (see picture at the end of the post).  Price is $10 on Dermstore for a 0.28 oz tube.\n\n**Cotz SPF 45 lip balm**  Active: Titanium Dioxide 4.0%, Zinc Oxide 5.5%.\nInactive: Alumina, Aluminum Hydroxide, Aluminum Stearate, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Cetearyl Isononanoate, Dicaprylate-Caprate, C12-15 Alkyls Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Hexadecanol, Hexadecyl Laurate, Iron Oxides, Ozokerite, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Flavor.\n\nThis is a physical sunscreen lip balm that is tinted brown.  Yes, brown.  The brown tint works surprisingly well, though I wish they'd come out with a pink option as well.  I don't find this to be drying at all. Contains antioxidants Vitamin C and E.  It smells a bit like candy, but the scent dissipates quickly.  Tastes how it smells, but only if i lick my lips.  I've gone through several tubes of this because I like it so much. It holds up fine in my pocket, though the label always gets rubbed off eventually.  Looks brown on lips but not overly so (see picture at the end of the post). I've purchased on the Cotz website, as well as on Dermstore.  It's about $6-7 for a 0.14 oz tube.\n\n**Ultrasun UltraLip SPF 30**  Ingredients: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, PEG-8 Beeswax, Cera Alba, Cocoglycerides, Cyclopentasiloxane, Candelilla Cera, Ceresin, Dipropylene Glycol Dibenzoate, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Cyclohexasiloxane, Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether Benzoate, Lecithin, Copernicia Cerifera Cera, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butyrospermum Parkii Extract, Aroma, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Oleate, Citric Acid.\n\nThis is a European product, so the percentages of active ingredients are not listed out.  We can see it contains octinoxate, Tinosorb S, and Uvinul A.  Contains antioxidants Vitamin C and E. Contains blackcurrent and meadowfoam oils. Because of the UVA circle, we know the PPD is at least 10, or equivalent to PA+++.  It says it contains aroma, but I smell nothing.  It feels like a regular lip balm, has a very nice texture and no taste at all.  I am not sure yet if it is drying (the weather is getting colder here, so it's hard to tell).  I purchased it on Feelunique and it's $7-8 for a 4.8 g tube.  I like it so far and would purchase again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/riyNr).",

    "body": "Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil is one of the most selling hair oil in the Indian Market. Why not, because it is made from almond oil which is beneficial for better immunity, a sharper brain, and healthy hair. But do this product, really has what it claims? What are the Ingredients? Is it worth using? Let’s find out.\n\nIngredient List of Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* LLP – 76.8% \n* Mustard Oil including Sweet Almond Oil – 21% \n* Perfume \n* Vit. E Acetate \n* TBHQ \n* CL 4700, CL 26100\n\n1. What is LLP? \n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_paraffin_(drug)#Health), LLP stands for Light liquid paraffin. It is a by-product of the petroleum industry and can contain cancer-causing hydrocarbons. This product has 76% of LLP. The reason is just to make it non-sticky. We understand that people don’t like sticky hairs, but this is absurd. Adding paraffin oil in a higher percentage can never add value to your hair.\n\n2. Sweet Almond Oil -\n\nIf you a look at the ingredients carefully, you will find that Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil has Sweet Almond Oil mixed with Mustard Oil. And, the overall percentage of Mustard Oil including Sweet Almond Oil is just 21%. That means, **Its main ingredient sweet almond oil is even less than 21%.** *Isn’t it a funny thing?* \n\n3. Perfume and Colors -\n\nThe brand has added perfume and two colors – CL 4700, CL 26100.  \n\nAs per the data of [MadeSafe,](https://www.madesafe.org/hazard-list-3/)  Perfume is used as an umbrella term for dozens of different ingredients that make up a particular scent. Many common fragrance ingredients, like phthalates and synthetic musks, are toxic to human health.  \n\nAs per the data of [MadeSafe](https://www.madesafe.org/hazard-list-3/),  Artificial colors can be derived from coal tar, but are more commonly made from petroleum. A number of artificial colors, individually and in combination, have been associated with increased hyperactivity in children, including those with pre-existing hyperactivity and without. \n\n4. TBHQ -  TBHQ is another common additive in hair oils. TBHQ stands for ‘Tertiary Butylhydroquinone’. It is mainly a Harsh Preservative used in Mineral Oils and Paraffin Oils. \n\n5. Vit. E Acetate – The only safe ingredient - Vit. E Acetate is also known as Tocopheryl Acetate is a safe ingredient and a great antioxidant. It helps in conditioning the skin. It is the only good thing about this product. Source - Biodizionario \n\nIs it Good & Safe to Use? The Conclusion –\n\nAlmond oil is naturally heavy in nature and as people love non-sticky hair oils, they have added LLP as a solution. It also contains potentially harmful preservatives, colors, and perfume.\n\nNow its your choice to choose whether the value for money products or continue using such products",

A gel feels lighter, especially in hot weather. Dr Lin daily hydrating gel and Sebamed face care gel are both on Amazon. Gels provide less moisture, but that's okay if you have oily skin.\n\nAlso, be aware that the Elta MD is tinted. So it can look a little makeup-y. It might work for you, but I don't want that to be a surprise in case your didn't realize that. If you want untinted physical sunscreen, check out Elta MD Pure. The CeraVe sunscreen had mixed reviews. I think a lot of people have issues with the strong white cast and heaviness.",

All had to be done by hand as i didnt have access to my usual equipment\n\n2 hours to build up the final patina to prevent it rusting so easily. Previously despite being dry weather and liberally oiled, the fittings and blade rusted quite easily. Worse still was the 3 or so inches of blade that had contact with the leather tongues in the scabbard which caused heavy pitting that i wasnt able to remove fully. The leather tongues have been saturated in paraffin oil to stop this from happening in future.\n\nLastly the pommel nut was flattened on two sides so it could be easily tightened, a brass washer to hide the otherwise visible gap between the flat sides of the nut and the pommel. If i was to do this again, i wouldnt remove as much material from the nut.\n\nIts now a very competent cutter but some of the deeper flaws like a 1.5mm gap either side of the tang and guard still need to be adressed as shimming probably wont suffice\n\n",

    "body": "I've found one of the best and cheapest moisturisers I've ever used.\n\nFirst a summary of my skin is at the moment - I'm currently on isotretinoin (Accutane/Roaccutane) for mild but persistent adult acne.  I've been on it for about 3 months now and my skin has changed from extremely oily and acne prone to normal/dry and slightly sensitive.  After a LOT of trial and error, I finally landed on Redwin Hyaluronic Hydration.  It's about $6 for 220g at Chemist Warehouse!\n\nBefore trying the Redwin, I went through moisturisers from Skinceuticals (Triple Lipid Restore & Epidermal Repair), Cerave Cream, Cetaphil Daily Hydration, QV (Cream and Lotion), Avene Cicalfate, Dermaveen (Calmexa Cream), and Vanicream and none were completely right.  They either broke me out and clogged my pores or were uncomfortable to wear (too heavy, not hydrating enough, too sticky, odd smell, pilled with sunscreen).  The Skinceuticals Triple Lipid Restore was beautiful but it's extremely expensive and I went through a jar in about a month.  \n\nEnter the Redwin Hyaluronic Hydration.  What caught my eye initially was the lack of Ceteareth-20.  This emollient is found in almost every heavier moisturiser that's recommended for people on Accutane and I found it to be extremely pore clogging.  It was almost unavoidable. \n\nThe rest of the ingredients list looked pretty nice as well:\n\nWater, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Myristyl Myristate, Stearic Acid, PEG-100 Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, Carbomer, Chlorphenesin, Beeswax, Myristyl Laurate, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate, Squalane, BHT, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbyl Palmitate\n\nWhat was there to lose?  It was only $6 and I could use it on the body if it didn't work for my face.  Boy, was I glad I picked this up.  Prior to accutane, I was a luxury skincare junkie and this moisturiser is one of the best I’ve ever tried in terms of texture and performance.\n\nSo here's why I love it:\n\n* It feels beautiful on - silky smooth and sinks right in. I can layer it over and over and it never does anything weird.  I feel hydrated and comfortable - it's never cloying or heavy even if you use huge amounts.  I'm glowy but never oily or greasy.\n* It’s the perfect mix of hydrating and occlusive.  You'd think it'll be heavy with liquid paraffin being the 2nd ingredient but it's very lightweight.\n* Works beautifully under sunscreen and makeup.  It doesn't pill and concealer doesn't slip and slide around.   \n* It’s  fragrance free and has not clogged my pores despite how much I use - a huge dollop multiple times a day and even reapplications over itself when I'm feeling drier than normal.  \n* It’s basic and no-frills enough that it’s not going to interfere with my treatment but still has some nice ingredients to nourish and improve the skin.\n\nAnd the best part - it’s  **$6 for 220g**! I go nuts and use it all over myself because it’s so cheap!\n\nI haven’t seen it mentioned much on here but it would be a cult product if more people tried it.  I think it would work for a lot of people.  Definitely check it out if you're looking for an excellent all-around basic moisturiser that just does what it's supposed to do.",

    "body": "# Introduction\n\nIn a continuation of a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Masks4All/comments/1ee9v92/an_unfair_fit_test_battle_the_most_famous_ffp2_vs/), i'd like to open a discussion of the [lowest industrial grades ](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GruhCafWEAAlg-0?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)and how they can become a useful tool rather than a dismissed option of respiratory protection. The tests below include disposable masks from the UK, Sweden, South Korea, India and Brazil. In theory, the lowest grades of standards (that copy the European EN149) can filter at least 80% of oil and non oil particles. The key words here are : 1. at least , 2. oil particles. That being said, respirators from reputable companies a) filter way above the minimum of the standard, b) are well constructed when they intend to filter oil particles.\n\nThis is the 20th and last large post of a series started 3 years ago that comes to an end. Any future reviews will focus on one brand only and mainly new models released in 2025, with a significant shorter content, still with plenty of pictures.\n\n[ffp1 \\/ pff1 \\/ level 2 KCs \\(P1\\) disposable respirators](https://preview.redd.it/srt3ed0bx43f1.jpg?width=4995&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1da9a8bd18aaa3ec8e62d64669c872d25ee7272b)\n\n# P1 grades\n\nThe ffp1 grade is certified under the European EN 149:2001+A1:2009 standard and must filter at least 80% of NaCl and paraffin oil particles at 95L/min flow rate.\n\n|Class|Filter penetration limit (95L/min)|Inward Leakage|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|FFP1|Filters at least 80% of airborne particles|<22%|\n|FFP2|Filters at least 94% of airborne particles|<8%|\n|FFP3|Filters at least 99% of airborne particles|<2%|\n\n# Pros and Cons of the lowest grades\n\n**Pros**\n\n\\- Low breathing resistance, usually in the duckbill territory.\n\n\\- Better fit and safer than the highest rated surgical masks (ASTM level 3 and type IIR)\n\n\\- Comfortable for single prolonged use and acceptable against air pollution and allergies.\n\n\\- Ideal for DIY works.\n\n\\- Similar fit than the ffp2 masks for the same brand series.\n\n\\- Vast majority of ffp1 masks are made by reputable manufacturers.\n\n\\- Lowest chances of counterfeit products.\n\n**Cons**\n\n\\- Usually, not value for money. Prices little below ffp2 respirators.\n\n\\- Obvious discounts on materials, with cheap elements(straps, foams etc) and a paper feel, with many exceptions though.\n\n\\- Inconsistency on fit tests and small reusability for some recognizable models.\n\n\\- Faster degradation of the main elements from some models.\n\n# The Brand list\n\nMost of the models below have been tested and presented to other posts in the past. All fit tests were done in N99 mode, which measures particles (from 0.02μm to 1μm) inside the mask that go through the seal and the filter as well. The lack of an N95 companion on the portacount is one reason of valuable info and a spherical conclusion are missing. Every test (1,2,3,4) below shows the overall fit factor. If you want to calculate the % filtration efficiency on my face, the formula is : 100-(100/fit factor)\n\n# Dräger\n\nThe 1910 ffp1 three panel respirator is designed to fit the same as the 1920 and 1930 versions. The key difference is the quality of the materials. The masks feels like paper and the company tried to save money with less glue on the foam in some batches. Other than that, all key elements are more or less the same (strap, nose wire, nose foam, fit), with top of the line combination of comfort and superb seal.\n\nThe breathing resistance and the overall experience is great, even lower than the 1920/1950 iterations, in the duckbill area. The strap tension is perfect, in contrast to some ffp2 and ffp3 batches received from kleinschmidtgmbh and the temperature inside the mask is very cool. This is one of the best ffp1s available on the market.\n\n|Model / Test|1st Test|2nd Test|3rd Test|4th Test|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Dräger 1910 ffp1|195|152|223|254|\n\n**Reference**  Dräger 1920 ffp2 : 421\n\n[Dräger 1910 ffp1](https://preview.redd.it/hkd5aj7jx43f1.jpg?width=5787&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=751be3c6e282adbf225b739a1c9feba7c5008dc3)\n\n# 3M\n\nSimilar with Dräger, 3M doesn't make big discounts in quality for the ffp1 options apart from the 3M Aura models.\n\n**3M Aura 9310+ ffp1**\n\nThe cheap feel of the thin material remains, in addition to the lower quality yellow polyisoprene straps. The nose wire is more or less the same as the ffp2 version and the installation of the foam slightly worse. Breathing resistance of the 9310+ ffp1 is low and the fit remains secure. The bad thing is that the yellow straps will lose their elasticity very quickly, as shown on the tests below. Price usually is floating around 1 euro, which is far more expensive than the deals found for the 9320+ffp2 (x20 pcs). The 9312+ with the cool flow valve would make sense during summer. Even better is the exceptional solution of the 9312+Gen3 that allows 185% more exhaled air through the optical valve than the previous version and features wide braided straps.\n\n|Model / Test|1st Test|2nd Test|3rd Test|4th Test|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|3M Aura 9310+ ffp1|170|101|125|91|\n\n**Reference** 3M Aura 9320+ ffp2 : 1263\n\n[3M Aura 9310+ ffp1 \\(yellow straps\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jk9lchecy43f1.jpg?width=5682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d1eff724326f89a83ba33235a3d515ad4f08bc4)\n\n**3M VFlex 9101E ffp1**\n\nMost of the ffp1/pff1/P1 grades have the advantage of the duckbill N95/ffp2 breathing experience. So, what could beat the N95/ffp2 duckbills?  The ffp1 disposable from VFlex shares the exact same elements of the ffp2 model (metal nose wire, straps, shape) apart from the filter media. It also comes in a version with valve, so it wouldn't be a surprise being the most breathable respirator. The specific model tested here was manufactured early in 2019 and has expired more than a year. The only downside is the inner temperature, which is higher than the Dräger 1910 ffp1. The version with valve should have the optimum comfort.\n\n|Model / Test|1st Test|2nd Test|3rd Test|4th Test|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|3M VFlex 9101E ffp1|169|157|144|168|\n\n**Reference** 3M VFlex 9152E ffp2  : 224\n\n[3M VFlex 9101E ffp1](https://preview.redd.it/gg61x6tyy43f1.jpg?width=5682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73bb304a43c292923c11f0c8b0acf0898162a2f8)\n\n**3M C101 ffp1**\n\nThe cheap cup shape from 3M features similar elements as the C102 ffp2 iteration, apart from the thinner nose foam and filter material. The nose wire and the straps are the same. One downside is the staples touching the face and making the experience uncomfortable. Prices for the C101 ffp1 and C102 ffp1 are usually the same, ranging from 0.7 to 1 euro.\n\n|Model / Test|1st Test|2nd Test|3rd Test|4th Test|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|3M C101 ffp1|82|124|96|130|\n\n**Reference** 3M C102 ffp2 : 252\n\n[3M C101 ffp1](https://preview.redd.it/r6nrymda253f1.jpg?width=5746&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=232847dc76f2cde304b19a2374885c4089530183)\n\n[3M C101 ffp1 inner part](https://preview.redd.it/2wboovk8z43f1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5969637f9a20a488ac675a1e764e8dbf88164861)\n\n**3M 9914 ffp1**\n\nThis is a better 3M cup shape with the addition of an activated carbon filter, braided straps and good construction overall. Listed over 3 euro per piece. Sometimes the ffp1 versions may carry asymmetric nose clips, but the protection remains the same. One thing to note is that both 3M cup shapes tested here were produced in 2019 and obviously, they have expired.\n\n|Model / Test|1st Test|2nd Test|3rd Test|4th Test|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|3M 9914 ffp1|111|125|96|123|\n\n[3M 9914 ffp1](https://preview.redd.it/3b5jhl0iz43f1.jpg?width=5832&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5885b2ad99e0fad392b572d7252ec2b9dd6d5c64)\n\n**3M Aura 9310+BR Azul**\n\nThe Brazilian iteration from the Aura series have the aesthetics, but lacks the good filter media found in the European models. It also has the most awful smell of all disposable models ever tried. It is so distinct that the sense of the musty odor is present from meters away. This was the main reason that only one fit test was performed,but the real time fit factor showed the same levels of protection, with numbers ranging around 30. Not bad for a pff1, with a great seal, that mainly allows particles inside the filter and blocks almost 97% of them.\n\nOverall fit factor 3M Aura 9310+BR pff1 : 27\n\n**Reference** 3M Aura 9322+BR pff2 Azul : 216\n\n[3M Aura 9310+BR Azul](https://preview.redd.it/70ns9blt553f1.jpg?width=5835&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b33216c1c2293a8f4aee02aac46f965f5d465903)\n\n[3M Aura 9310+Br pff1 Azul](https://preview.redd.it/4zqnr6hkz43f1.jpg?width=5848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f6d305f25611de2da9439f51b10a06034b3631)\n\n# Evergreen CleanTop\n\nThe masks from the Korean manufacturer are following the industrial KOSHA standard, as reviewed in previous posts. Both models were KCs level 2 grade, which are equivalent to P1/ffp1.\n\n**CleanTop C600 KCs P1 (L)**\n\nLike every inner frame from the Evergreen series, the fit is superb at the neckloop position. Not a coincidence from a big Korean manufacturer that produces the best frames of the market, shares a great industrial KCs series and also N95/N99/ffp2/ffp3 disposable respirators on this category. This is the perfect example why the lowest grades should include a sealing ring. It drastically improves the fit. Not only inner frames, but most of the Korean industrial respirators are well made, compatible with the skin and better overall than the Chinese options, but with a minimal variety.\n\nThe main difference on fit test results relies that the 1st and 2nd test were not performed at default strap position for picture purposes, in contrast to the 3rd and 4th, which took place with a new sample. Speaking about straps, the majority of Korean companies use specific braided straps for neckloop position that don't hurt the ears. The model tested here is L, but the company also shares several XL variations. As seen on [Accumed testing results](https://blog.accumed.com/products/evergreen-cleantop-kf80/), the trifold KF80 from Evergreen CleanTop has a PFE over 99%, showcasing a performance way above its standard. That could be the same case for the inner frame model as well.\n\n|Model / Test|1st Test|2nd Test|3rd Test|4th Test|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CleanTop C600 KCs Level 2 (P1)|186|155|371  (2nd sample)|396   (2nd sample)|\n\n**Reference** Evergreen CleanTop C650V KCs level 1 (P2) : 824\n\n[Evergreen CleanTop C600 KCs level 2 \\(P1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/40qy4x60053f1.jpg?width=5580&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1aaa9d1b49ad024513aeb5810cfdb0f018712b26)\n\n[Evergreen CleanTop inner frame](https://preview.redd.it/1me1c5g0053f1.jpg?width=6209&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0885ec8fb53877dce519d49f8233442199de9d5b)\n\n**CleanTop C260 KCs P1**\n\nThe C260 is a level 2 KCs (P1) cup shape respirator. The main problem is found on the foam behind the sealing ring, as stated on a previous post. Others may have a better luck. A thicker and longer foam would increase drastically the seal around the nose. The 2nd and most current test was made with a new sample at default neckloop position. The nose leakage persists in all tests, despite the better testing results. For reference, the P2 version has also nose leakage on my face.\n\n|Model / Test|1st Test|2nd Test|3rd Test|4th Test|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CleanTop C260 KCs level 2 (P1)|81|177                  (2nd sample)|210                 (2nd sample)|184                        (2nd sample)|\n|**Reference** CleanTop C460V KCs level 1 (P2)|92|151                  (2nd sample)|98 (2nd sample)|133                         (2nd sample)|\n\n[Evergreen CleanTop C260 KCs level 2 \\(P1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/aaerdmei353f1.jpg?width=5830&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e815bc3ee1fb6bb9f6c091fc28385dd6abf5ccaa)\n\n[The inner part of CleanTop C260 P1](https://preview.redd.it/pvoeq4q1153f1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c35334ed73df538175437e2d1af45673b064e103)\n\n# F.F. Group (Venus)\n\nManufactured by a reputable company in India, the OEMs tested here carry a German CE and are labeled for a Greek tools company.\n\n**Venus 457 C ffp1**\n\nThe cup shape carries a wide and strong metal nose wire, super long adjustable straps and a nice foam with pores. Straps are stitched and of a lower quality, but they hold remarkably well. The size of the cup is L on the generous side. Breathing resistance is low, as expected for an ffp1 and the price was 55 cents. Fit tests were an easy pass each time, proving that the lowest grades perform very well, when the seal is not compromised. One thing to mention: there wasn't a repetition of the remarkably high result of the first test.\n\n|Model / Test|1st Test|2nd Test|3rd Test|4th Test|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Venus 457 C ffp1|531|281|274|336|\n\n[Venus 457 C ffp1](https://preview.redd.it/qvcpzh4j353f1.jpg?width=5786&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ae18db8e3c3cc064ee9327cbafc6c2bc6ced75)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ukdz7rht353f1.jpg?width=5988&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8aa1f0e048f54e244b8e32a4176c519ca040928\n\n**Venus  4410 - SL ffp1**\n\nThe bifold ffp1 features adjustable headstraps and a short malleable full metal nose wire. No foam installed. Size wise, the mask once again is more like a M/L and the price was 45 cents. Breathing resistance is lower than the cup shape. Again, repeating the tests provided half fit factors, similar to the cup shape.\n\n|Model / Test|1st Test|2nd Test|3rd Test|4th Test|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Venus 4410 - SL ffp1|121|62|65|83|\n\n[F.F.

The seal is what matters most, rather than the filtration efficiency of a mask that heavily leaks. Certainly, the N95 companion would have provided more valuable results. The N95 companion that skips measuring particles getting through the filter would give clear answers on these questions.\n\nThe main problem is the marketing, when the general public reads at least 80% particulate efficiency versus 99% on a blue surgical mask, usually only against bacteria. The obvious pick will always be the worst fit/worst mask.\n\nSome questions arising though. For my face, if an ffp1 ranging around 100 fit factors and an ffp2 multiple times better, what would be the case for someone else passing a fit test around 200 with a 3M Aura ffp2/N95 and decides to use the lower grade? Will the ffp1 equivalent fail the test miserably? At least with heavy exercise, the results will drop below 100, when the flow rate is multiple times higher than the normal breathing of a fit test. Also, reusing the same mask could be a challenge, especially for the three panel respirators. The ideal shape is the cup, as long as the basic materials are not downgraded by the manufacturer. The effect of multiple donnings  has often the same impact as the one time extensive use of 8+ hours, not only seen here, but with higher grades as well. Just because some disposable respirators from big manufacturers can maintain a pass on fit tests, use after use, it doesn't mean other models from different companies will behave the same.\n\nOn the other hand, all fit tests were done in N99 mode, which measures particles (from 0.02μm to 1μm) inside the mask that go through the seal and the filter as well.  Wouldn't it be the protection of an ffp1 even better for particles from 1μm to 5μm? For protection against pathogens, aren't these particles carrying more viral load than the smaller ones?\n\nWhile 'N' and 'P' respirators may provide the same protection against viruses, usually those that are designed to block oil particles are built with better materials from big manufacturers and are  solid performers, especially masks with activated carbon filters.\n\n[3M 8710E ffp1 \\(picture taken from the internet\\)](https://preview.redd.it/6pjchj0s653f1.jpg?width=2112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2d5cddfac511960a4326592b5a54fde0432d8d1)\n\n# Improving surgical masks\n\nAfter trying and testing a dozen of respirators with activated carbon filter, there is a pattern showcasing superior construction against models that don't prevent odors. Even on a surgical shape, manufacturers tend to produce the best models, when it comes to carbonated versions.\n\nThe model below is an anti-pollution mask with long ear straps, following the GB 32610-2016 standard. The key difference with the blue surgical options is that it shares rough edges on the sides. The main leakage comes from the sides due to the strap tension, providing fit factors in the region of 2+(50% - 60% protection). Once the S-hook is used, the testing result jumped to 52 (98%+ protection), as it closed the side gaps. When using Fix The Mask, the overall fit factor increased to 291 (99.65% protection). Improving the rectangular surgical shape and providing better elements (metal nose wires, tight sides, sealing rings) could be vital during emergencies, instead of relying on the more difficult production of respirators.\n\n[Laianzhi K2010](https://preview.redd.it/nm49tjgp153f1.jpg?width=5790&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b50a4fdad8cd692d4bd14a44620fdce5b90e6fe)\n\n# Did you know?\n\n3M used to carry plastic nose clips in some older models, such as the K100 duckbill series. The K111 ffp1 was meant to be featured on this review, but the store selling it removed it after inquiring about the ffp1 model. It was expired long time ago, so they couldn't sell it. Therefore, the decision was made for the VFlex model, as a substitute. Ancient relics do exist in hardware stores, but they're either too expensive with early pandemic - sky rocket - prices or unavailable online.\n\n[3M K100 series](https://preview.redd.it/fvc5rumq153f1.jpg?width=1756&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ab3a0f1064308733180b011ee751add4baccfc)\n\n# The importance of the donning procedure\n\nMrs Mari Salguerio from 3M Spain / Portugal made a simple presentation on how important is to form the nose wire during the donning procedure. The mask used on this video was a 3M Aura 9332+ ffp3. A simple, careful and correct donning will provide the best possible fit for the wearer. As we see on the projector, the real time fit factors remain over 1000 (>99.90%) protection, when the nose wire is pressed to close the gaps. Once the nose wire was flattened, the fit factor dropped to 3.5 (71.4%), in the protection region of a surgical mask. A tiny detail can change the protection drastically. It goes to show that a quick donning may not provide the ideal seal for beginners.\n\nThe red circle shows the ambient particles per cm\\^3 (43274), the particles inside the mask (16) and the real time fit factor (2773), when the mask is correctly donned. After un-shaping the nose wire, the particles inside the mask jumped to 13568 (from 16) and the fit factor dropped to 3.1 .\n\n[**Video**](https://youtu.be/laG9AQQgY2E?t=1353)\n\n[Before and after un-shaping the nose wire](https://preview.redd.it/0r8cbvsgm53f1.jpg?width=1066&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=340a34a9ca534ab9cd4f9f5ad52762cb12bbf705)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWhat could be the target group of the ffp1/P1 respirators? Apart from DIY house works, it may be an upgrade for wearers than can't tolerate the higher breathing resistance of the ffp2/ffp3 respirators and dislike the duckbill look, with the neccessary condition of passing a fit test. The ffp1 models should be suitable for kids, for the low pressure drop, as long as they're not large enough and can properly fit professional disposable masks. The ffp1s have the potential to be an upgrade from earloops as well or generally a mask that doesn't fit well. The argument of  ffp2 duckbills may arise and a potential response could be the equivalent ffp1 models of them, such as the 3M VFlex 9101 ffp1.\n\nOne thing's for sure: Stereotypes still exist, generalizing masks by their grades, shapes and standards. Everyone should at least agree that the lowest grades of the industrial standards are safer than any loose fitting medical masks, which their purpose of use are surgeries.",

A single one of these got me from May 2020 to through the winter. Amazing breathable an easily washable. Probably only high 80%'s PFE.

My partner recalls ER/ED (UK: A&E) nursing in the early 2000's where a FFP2 went into a paper back at breaks and end of shift, and would come out again for (same person) second or third use. I can reports that the FFP2/KN95 of 2021 onwards had shift nose wire. I think that would stymie the 50+ hours that [3M's Nikki McCullough talked with Aaron about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tk9PNOHWng). And that's key because in 2020 the negative thinkers would use crumby nose wire to support their \"these are only single use\". Adaptive (problem solving) thinking would've been to upgrade the nose wire, even for unused stock. That could've be done in bulk (technicians in nitrite gloves, tested as -ve, room sealed, away from the front line).",

    "body": "Hello Ladies! I thought I would create this post as I haven’t seen a very detailed thread about hair care yet. We often talk about skincare and beneficial or terrible ingredients here and on the wider web, however I always think hair care is never as thoroughly investigated. I’m a total newbie at hair styling, however I will blow my own trumpet and say after years of research and trial and error I’m pretty good at hair care. This will probably be very long even without me going into lots of detail, but feel free to ask in comments for more detail on specific things that interest you and I will expand. Also chime in with any extra info, especially if you’re curly haired! My experience and knowledge is more based in straight and slightly wavy hair. \n\nA disclaimer – proper hair care can be time consuming and require lots of trial and error at first, it did for me and everyone who I know is really into it too, but in my opinion it is worth it. It doesn’t have to be pricy though, there are lots of great cheap products! Once you find what works for you though, you will really reap the benefits for life. \n\n\nSo, let’s start!\n\n\n**Finding out the true state of your hair**\n\nMost likely you use silicones on your hair (a lot of products contain them), and silicones coat your hair, make it soft, sometimes weigh it down. They cover a lot of hair care sins. To find out the true condition of your hair, you will need to strip it of silicones. To do this, you will need to use a shampoo with a fairly strong detergent, sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), or sodium coco-sulfate are often shunned, however they are great for removing silicones from hair. You can then apply a non-silicone conditioner, and then wait for your hair to dry naturally. At this stage, you will see how good (or bad) a condition your hair is really like. It may still be looking great, but you may get quite a shock and decide you need quite the chop. I know I did the first time I cleansed my hair properly. It went from being fairly soft albeit a bit flat with just some split ends, to dry, tangled, and extremely brittle on the bottom 10cm. It looked matted. I took off a third of my length immediately and then a few months later another 5cm or so. I will edit this later once I find some before photos of my hair, and I will also do a current photo with my hair free of silicones.\n\n**Figuring out your hair porosity**\nHair porosity is your hair’s ability to absorb moisture. There is theoretically a simple test [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/40/3d/62/403d621b14f0c8c63e04ec9b61c02508.png) you can do, however over time you may find the result of it wasn’t 100%. I have medium porosity, meaning my hair absorbs moisture okay and keeps it for a decent amount of time. Low porosity hair doesn’t absorb moisture easily, however once it does, the moisture stays for a very long time. This can lead to product build up which will need to be cleansed regularly. Low porosity often requires using heat to absorb moisture (such as putting on a hair mask, a plastic shower cap and blowing hot air at it). High porosity hair absorbs moisture quickly, but it also lets it out quickly. Often requires good conditioning, but may also require cleansing from time to time. It will often feel frizzy, and humidity will have a big impact on high porosity hair. Unfortunately, you can’t really change the porosity of your hair, but you can definitely care for it! \n\n\n**Ingredients and Products**\n\nI have to say, compared to the east, the west has actually rather limited hair care options. Most high street and even salon brands are really not fantastic. I live in the UK, but I source most of my products from Eastern Europe, so for those of you in the US my specific recommendations might not be too much help, but you might be able to find some or find alternatives by looking at the ingredients list. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\nThere isn’t really a super easy way to go about this. After a year or so I learnt the names of ingredients that really work or don’t work for me and I look for or avoid them. [Here]( http://www.tightlycurly.com/ingredients/) is a good ingredients list which tells you what the ingredient is and what it is used for. It does also have a ‘good’ ‘okay’ ‘avoid’ rating system, however I wouldn’t necessarily take it into consideration, as how a lot of ingredients affect you is personal (for example some people’s hair responds well to sulfates or paraffin, others not so much). \n\nThe order of the ingredients list is not accidental. The further from the top, the less of that ingredient there is. Any beneficial ingredient listed after ‘parfum’ is not going to bring you any results, as it is basically a trace, however something that you are sensitive to can still have a negative effect on your scalp even at such trace amounts. \n\n*Things to look for*: \n\n*Oils* – any ingredient name that ends with oil (except mineral oil which is paraffin, more on this later!) is beneficial for hair. The more and the closer to the top of the list, the better, especially in masks and conditioners.\n\n*Extracts* – again any name that ends with extracts. These are extracts of naturally occurring plants, herbs, or even legumes which have different beneficial effects such as smoothing, adding shine, protecting or strengthening. \n\n*Emolients* – lanolin, anything with ‘butter’ (e.g. shea butter), cera alba (beeswax), pafarrinum liquidum (paraffin, more on this later)\n\n*Humectants* – glycerin, urea, mel (honey), aloe vera, fructose (sugars).\n\n*Antioxidants* – ascorbic acid (vit C), tocopherol (vit E), Ubiquinone (Q10), retinol/retinyl acelate/palmiatate (vit A), niacinamide (vit B3). \n\n*Proteins* – hydrolysed silk, hydrolysed keratin, hydrolysed wheat protein, hydrolysed oat protein. Proteins help to strengthen hair. \n\n*Soothing ingredients* – allantoin, arnica montana, calendula officinalis, panthenol. Particularly useful if you have a sensitive scalp.\n\n\n*What to avoid (generally speaking):*\n\n*Sulfates* – Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, although if anything in the ingredients list of your shampoo ends with sulfate, check on the list for strength. Sulfates don’t always need to be avoided.  They are cleansers and foaming agents used in a large majority of shampoos. They can strip your hair of oils and humectants and dry the skin on your scalp, however they are also useful in the removal of silicones.  They shouldn’t be used every day, but once a week to every 2 weeks is recommended if you use silicones on your hair. If your scalp and roots respond well to sulfates, you can protect the lengths of your hair by applying an oil or conditioner pre-washing, thoroughly washing your scalp and roots with a sulfate shampoo and only using the leftover foam on the length, then conditioning again. There are more and less harsh versions, and the gentler ones can be used more frequently, please refer to ingredient list! Not recommended for curly hair.\n\n*Parabens and preservatives* – Ones I found particularly harmful to me personally: DMDM Hydantoin, 5-Bromo-5-Nitro-1,3-Dioxane, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Diazolidynyl Urea, Imidiazolidynyl Urea, Phenyl Benzoate, Phenyl Dimethicone, Formaldehyde, Methylchloroisothiazolinone. Parabens are used to prevent products from going off. They’re not the only preservatives used in hair care and by no means the worst ones, but they can affect your scalp and hair. Eco-shampoos and conditioners are often filled with alcohol instead of parabens which can really dry out your scalp and hair. I don’t find parabens to be bad for my hair at all, but this is personal and you will have to eliminate and reintroduce (see that thing I said about time consuming at the start?) to really find out. You will not be able to find a preservative free product, therefore it is worth checking which work for you. \n\n*Alcohol* – alcohol denat and isopropyl alcohol, most others are fatty alcohols which are moisturising. The only time harsh alcohols are useful is when using hair ‘rubs’, where they help with product absorption. \n\n*Scents* – most scenting ingredients are listed under parfum, however some particularly harsh ones are required to be listed separately. These are: limonene, linalool, citronellol, geraniol, coumarin, citral, benzyl benzoate and eugenol. They’re usually at the very end of the list and in the trace amounts will not usually do any harm unless you have a sensitivity. \n\n*Silicones* – similarly to sulfates, silicones are not always bad. I personally like silicones. They work with my hair without concealing its true condition much or weighing it down. If your hair is thin you may find it better to only use the more soluble ones or none at all.\nI avoid shampoos with silicones at all cost though. The job of a shampoo is to cleanse your hair and prepare it for absorption of beneficial ingredients. I allow water soluble and gentle shampoo soluble silicones in conditioners and hair masks, and I use SLS requiring silicones in leave in conditioners that I only put on the ends of my hair. \n\nWater soluble silicones are: dimethicone copolyol, lauryl methicone copolyol, hydrolyzed wheat protein hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and silicones with PEG and a number at the start. The higher the number (especially above 10), the more water soluble the silicone. \n\nSilicones soluble in mild shampoo: amodimethicone, dimethicone, dimethiconol, beheonoxy dimethicone, phenyl trimethicone.\n\nNeed sulfates: simethicone, trimethicone, trimethylsilylamodimethicone, trimethylsiloxysilicates.\n\nEvaporate from hair (only washing with a conditioner to become soluble): cyclometicone, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclotetrasiloxane, octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane.\n\nI would advise completely removing silicones from your hair care routine for a week (you might find out your hair curls when it never did before), and then slowly reintroducing them one by one from the mildest to the heaviest ones to see how your hair reacts.  \n\n*Paraffin*  - Mineral Oil, Paraffinum Liquidum, Paraffin Oil, white oil are most common names of Paraffin. Paraffin has made a bad name for itself, it is known to be comedogenic to skin, however this does not happen to everybody, and even then you don’t have to put it on your scalp. Paraffin can be found in conditioners, masks and hair oils, and I’ve never had problems with it as an ingredient. It is also found in a lot of baby products, as near enough no one is allergic to it. You will have to experiment to see how it works for you. If it agrees with your hair, it works much quicker than natural oils – you will see results from first use, rather than after months of regular use. Products containing paraffin can be used after washing and conditioning to protect your hair from split ends. Paraffin requires stronger cleansing agents such as SLS for removal, and therefore not recommended for curly hair. \n\n\n**Products**\n\nNow, let’s look at specific products and how to get the most of them. \n\n*Hair Oils*\nI cannot recommend hair oils enough. This is probably the number one thing that changed my hair. I have been using hair oils for 6+ years and have never looked back. I’ve tried A LOT of oils, and my favourite one is [khadi]( https://www.essentialslondon.com/products/hair-care/khadi-vitalising-hair-oil-100ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuOPxmKHw1QIVCrftCh1njgn9EAQYAyABEgIwGPD_BwE#fo_c=762&fo_k=e4b0478aa27161be9771ad687e8f656d&fo_s=gplauk). It promotes hair growth and keeps my hair healthy and shiny, but some people don’t like the scent. Pure argan oil and rosehip oil are also great for me, as is pure coconut oil or the coconut hair oil from [vatika]( https://www.amazon.com/Dabur-Vatika-Enriched-Coconut-150ml/dp/B006BA3BAY/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_121_bs_t_1/136-1463637-2732606?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B8H7QG82QJF78X98V78D). There are a lot of oils on the market, just make sure what you’re using is pure oil, not stuff like the brand ‘moroccan oil’ because even your cooking olive oil is better than that. You can find a lot of indian hair oils on amazon. Apply by taking a few droplets and warming them up in your palms, then rubbing into the scalp and the lengths of the hair. When I first started my hair care and my hair was quite damaged, I would apply oils overnight every other night (before washing), and sleep with a cotton hair cap on to prevent transfer onto my pillow, then wash it off and condition in the morning. I now wash my hair in the evenings, so I apply it for about an hour before washing and I find that’s enough, but my hair is not particularly damaged.\n\n*Shampoos*\n\nFor day to day cleansing I try to find as simple a shampoo as possible, such as this [Babydream]( https://www.codecheck.info/kosmetik_koerperpflege/babypflege/babyshampoo/ean_4305615272467/id_792172/Babydream_Shampoo_mit_Kamille.pro). I’ve tried other ones over the years, but always come back to this one as it’s super cheap and gentle. I also like [Equilibria aloe vera shampoo]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51609,equilibra-aloe-shampoo.html). Other products that I’ve used as a shampoo that aren’t a shampoo: [Facelle intimate wash]( http://www.rossmann.pl/Produkt/Facelle-intim-plyn-do-higieny-intymnej-Sensitive-300-ml,101735,7210), [Johnson’s Baby 3in1 Wash]( http://www.johnsonsbaby.com.pl/johnsons-baby-%C5%82agodny-p%C5%82yn-do-mycia-cia%C5%82a-i-w%C5%82os%C3%B3w-3w1). At the start I found my hair a bit tangled after use, but I think that was partly due to the damage. For heavier cleansing I use [Avalon organics rosemary]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Avalon-Organics-Rosemary-Volumizing-Shampoo/dp/B001ET78QU) or any of the herbal [Barwa Natura]( https://www.barwa.com.pl/seria/barwa-naturalna/) shampoos. I do this every 10-14 days depending on how my hair feels regarding silicones and paraffin that I’ve used. A special mention goes to [Babuszka Agafia Black Soap]( https://bioika.pl/pl/p/Naturalne-Syberyjskie-Czarne-Mydlo-Agafii-na-bazie-37-ziol/659) which is just amazing. \n\n*Conditioners*\n\nI like to go rich here. I look for alllll of the extracts, oils, humectants, anything and everything. My everyday conditioner is the [Garnier avocado and shea butter]( https://www.fragrancedirect.co.uk/garnier-ultimate-blends-the-nourishing-repairer-conditioner-0083190.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=merchant&utm_keyword=foo&istCompanyId=17773c4e-a26f-4631-9b91-73e6422dbe77&istItemId=xiqwpwpqil&istBid=tztx&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9Oud06Lw1QIVxbztCh0PbQzcEAkYASABEgI4UfD_BwE) and it’s been with me for years. I also like the [seboradin ginseng conditioner]( https://seboradin.pl/en/seboradin-revitalizing/29-lotion-seboradin-revitalizing.html), Nivea Long Repair, [Balea Coconut and Milk](http://lepotica.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/balea-mleko-za-telo-lepotica.jpg) and [Timotei Precious Oils]( https://www.amazon.com/Timotei-Precious-Oil-Hair-Conditioner/dp/B00UGHRW6M). Currently I apply in-shower for however long it takes me to shave and wash, then rinse off. When my hair was damaged, I would put a cap on and leave them on for 30 mins, then rinse.\n\n*Masks*\n\nAs with conditioners, as many of the goodies as possible. This is probably the product I’ve switched up the most, as there are not very many BAD hair masks, usually they’re between average and amazing. My favourites over the years have been [Alterra]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,43114,haarkur-granatapfel-aloe-vera.html), [Natur Vital aloe vera]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,40836,naturvital-sensitive-hair-mask-aloe-vera-juniper-zimbro.html) mask, [biovax masks such as this]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/LBiotica-Biovax-Damaged-Hair-250ml/dp/B00N42XUL2), [Babuszka Agafia yeast mask]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51660,pervoe-reshenie-przepisy-babci-agafii-maska-do-wlosow-drozdzowa-na-pobudzenie-wzrostu.html) and [Kallos Latte]( https://www.notino.co.uk/kallos/serical-mask-for-damaged-chemically-treated-hair/?item=78561&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqp7vxKPw1QIVbb7tCh2u0QGcEAQYASABEgKtzPD_BwE) mask. I used to apply masks twice a week, but now I do it weekly or even every 10 days. Usually I will apply a mask instead of conditioner, throw on a shower cap, and keep it on for anywhere between 1 and 3 hours before rinsing. Sometimes I will blow warm air from the hairdryer to help the ingredients absorb better.\n\n*Rinses*\n\nThere are many rinses you can make at home, not really available as products to buy. I like a chamomile rinse the best as I’m blonde, I also like a dissolved aloe one, but you can experiment with ingredients recommended for your hair type. They can strengthen your hair, add shine, reduce frizz, make it sleeker.\n\n*Rubs*\n\nThese are products that you rub into your scalp and roots (and sometimes hair length) without rinsing off. My favourite is from [Jantar]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,69415,jantar-odzywka-do-wlosow-i-skory-glowy-nowa-wersja.html), I also like [Joanna Rzepa]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,17640,rzepa-kuracja-wzmacniajaca.html). There are also placenta capsules after which I got an insane amount of baby hair. Rubs help with growth and strength of hair!\n\n*Hair protection*\n\nI use something with silicones and proteins in to protect my end, usually the silk from [biovax]( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/112353278842?chn=ps&dispItem=1&adgroupid=44158024220&rlsatarget=pla-324287136906&abcId=1128926&adtype=pla&merchantid=115212699&poi=&googleloc=1007281&device=c&campaignid=856227250&crdt=0), but some hair oils (especially coconut) will also do. I do this once my hair is at least half dry and leave it in. If I’m not washing my hair for longer than 2 days, I will reapply. \n\n*Vitamins, Supplements etc.*\n\nThere are a lot of supplements you can try to help your hair growth or its condition. Vitamin E is obviously a staple. Biotin is fantastic for hair growth. Pregnancy vitamins strengthen hair. Drinking nettle and horsetail tea will do wonders. If you are really, really adventurous and can stomach a lot, drinking yeast (fresh is best, but dry will do) is the best for hair growth. You need to drink it every day for a prolonged period of time though, and it is incredibly unpleasant so requires a lot of commitment.\n\n*Hair styling and others*\n\nAs you might have seen from my previous post, I don’t often style my hair, and have never done. I do hairdry on cold or lukewarm settings, but I only use heat stylers for events and I chuck in a lot of hair protection. I’m gonna experiment a little with styling after my most recent post, but after looking for styling products, I’ve found very few that are not harmful to hair. I don’t brush my hair wet unless using the wet brush, I have a cotton tshirt I use to absorb water from it with instead of a towel, I don’t sleep with it wet, I keep it in a loose twisted bun overnight mostly to avoid rubbing. I have 3 different hair brushes (sable and synthetic) and a tangle teezer. If it’s very windy, I plait my hair, and I wear a hat in the sun. I wear a cap to go swimming. \n\n\nWell done if you got to the end, you are a hero. I hope you find these tips useful and can pick and mix as you please! Give most products 3-4 weeks to do their work before you deem them useless though. Looking forward to any tips you ladies might have on hair care, discussion, and what you found works for you and if you’re as obsessive as I am about it! \n\n\nEdit: link with some [hair photos](https://imgur.com/a/CQU90), 6 year difference",

    "body": "So I transferred my Miltoniopsis to semi hydro yesterday and this is a short recap of the process: first I cut the flower to encourage vegetative growth. I have to new growths but they’re still very small and it will take a while until they produce roots. Normally I would have waited but the potting mix it came in was either 100% coco coir or just straight up soil and not breathable at all and it was full of millipedes, snails and earthworms so I decided that waiting probably wasn’t an option (still not sure). After cutting the flower spike I removed the medium and cut away the dead roots (which was most of the roots). Then, I treated the roots with 3% peroxide and the leaves with 1,5% paraffin oil dish soap solution. Then I potted it in LECA without a wick because I was afraid it would get colonised by bacteria but now I’m thinking I should have included a wick because the bottom 1/3 of the pot now just sits in water 🫤. Also I think LECA S/H might not hold enough moisture for the roots but I have no experience with semi hydro so I guess time will tell. Then I placed it with other plants over a large humidity tray near a window but blocked from most direct sunlight by the other plants.Now my question for you: what should I do differently in the future, any and all advice is appreciated 😅",

I would have added finer inorganic material as well like small grade pumice or seramis since as you've mentioned, the mix might be a bit dry for it. \n\nIf I have the time and availability, I would add the wick because it might make a difference with water uptake. If my wick goes all the way up to the roots, my mix also has more water in it. \n\nOverall, it's a lot of experience building with any plant and observation in time plays a significant role in what can be adjusted. I have all my collection in semihydro and I am not going back because it makes things easier for me. It did take a lot of trial and error to become more comfortable with the method.\n\nGood luck 🤞🏼",

Sometimes as two if you are lucky or with a beginning of new growth. \n\n\nI chose one from new shipment with two bulbs with some live roots and then second very sad single bulb one with rotten roots after rest was discounted. \n\n\nAnd I think you will find it reasuring that if even both of those look like they will pull through, yours have even better chances to grow well.

    "body": "Obviously not TODAY, but this happened about 1.5 years ago. A friend who taught another friend who taught me how to breathe fire was asking our group of fire-breathers we were all in as to if any of us wanted to participate in a paid gig. It would be on Halloween (2014) down at a huge event in Chicago. You know, the \"pay $100+ per ticket, it's a private property party with open bar and lots of food\" deal. \n\nI take the bus down, and meet up with him. Everything's chill and we go over to the location. Mind you, this is now around 6pm. The event starts at 9, we go on around 10:30 or so. NBD, nothing bad so far, the people seem fairly chill. We go on a tour to show me what the place is, where we'll be. We're assigned to be on these home-built \"mausoleums\" that people can walk into and get drinks, and we'll be standing on top of doing the breathing. Here's the first bad part. After the 20 minute tour of the joint, since I had never been there, the guys in charge tell us \"Oh, you won't be doing fire-breathing for 15 minutes, you'll be doing it for 3 hours\". I turn to look at my friend who's been doing breathing for a couple years longer than me, and he strikes a deal that we breath 15 on 5 off 15 on 15 off, whereas the guy though we could just be breathing fire for 3 hours straight. It took him some persuading, but he got it down to that much. (15 min on, 5 min off, etc.)\n\nSo, we've got approximately 3 hours until we go on, so we decide to leave to pick up the fuel that we need. 2nd bad part here. As we try to leave, the manager shows up and tells us we can't leave, even though the shop that sells the fuel is only a 5 minute drive away and we don't go on for 3 hours. WELL FUCK. Guess what type of fuel we had to use instead? My friend's spare fuel, which ended up having Citronella and Lemongrass in it (because it was Tiki Torch paraffin fuel, and we normally use purified paraffin oil, they are essentially the same thing except for the additives, like Citronella). \n\nOnce our time rolls around, as one might expect, we take some activated charcoal, because safety, and we put this horribly tasting fuel into our mouths, spit it out into a fine mist, and use a \"wand\" (a piece of metal with kevlar around the end) that's lit on fire to light the mist ablaze. We perform for 15 min, take a break for 5 minutes, perform for 15 minutes, and then climbed down for 15 minutes. 3rd fuck-up is we didn't bring a \"spit bottle\" so after roughly 30 minutes of breathing fire, we are not feeling too hot, since we didn't have anywhere to spit the fuel/saliva that had built up other than to package it into a half-assed breath. We grab our phones so we could communicate with eachother, as we were on different mausoleums, and head back up with empty water bottles to spit into.\n\nAfter 3 hours of this shit, which we both thought we could handle, but neither of us really knew since neither of us had breathed a longer duration than 30 minutes, we were beat as fuck. In short, when you breathe fire, some of the fuel slides down your throat like saliva would, as well as get absorbed into your bloodstream. We were both down for the count. In hindsight, i should've gotten my stomach pumped, as well as he should have.\n\nI crash at his place for the night, occasionally getting up to puke, and took a bus back to town. Halloween was on a friday, so I got back to my place, and at the time I was going to college, on a saturday. For 10 days, I was bedridden. I did not go to class, i did not eat much, i drank hella water. I literally poisoned myself to the point of I should have gone to the hospital and probably spend a day or two there. Oh, their paycheck to me took 2 months to get to me, and was only $150.\n\nTL,DR: Got a firebreathing gig, turned out to be a fairly bad gig, breathing for 3 hours instead of 15 minutes. Poisoned myself with the fuel because of the long duration of gig to the point of I should have gone to the hospital to get my stomach pumped and to spend a few days there. Icing on the cake, i got paid 2 months late and was only $150.",

They would have been forced to comply",

    "body": "So I just discovered that Nivea did the unforgivable crime of reformulating their classic bestseller - their body milk in light blue bottle with Shea butter and almond-y scent. It’s called the Nivea Pampering Soft Milk (VERWÖHNENDE SOFT MILK) in the light blue bottle. it’s also called:\nNivea Smooth Sensation Body Soft Milk or Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, depending on the country. The formula for all those three names is the same, I’ve checked (after going down this rabbit hole), and the colour of the bottle is the same. \n\nAnd if you are in the US, then the formula for a similarly-looking Nivea body lotion in the light blue bottle (which in the US is called Nivea Shea Nourish Body Lotion) is different from both old and new European formulas for the same product 😩 the old European formula is better, the US formula is much simpler (but should work in a humid climate where people don’t need as much moisture). \n\nback to European formulas:\n\nApparently, they’ve also reformulated their other body milks/body lotions, both in deep blue colour bottle and in the white bottle (which is why those products no longer work for my skin 😩). \n\nThe new formula isn’t as hydrating and occlusive as the old one (even though the new formula claims to give hydration for 72 hours, the old one was better). Basically, the old formula has a richer feel, stays longer on the skin and locks-in moisture better, for longer period of time bc it had stronger occlusives and emollients. But as the result, it was a bit tugging on the skin and took a few minutes to absorb. The new formula absorbs immediately,  is easier to apply but is less hydrating. And it now contains denatured alcohol (at least in the light blue and white bottles). So, if you live high humidity and have normal, combo or slightly dry skin, you probably will be okay with the new formula. But if you live in dry air or have extremely dry skin, then you probably would prefer the old formula. \n\nfor years the old Nivea Body Milk in light blue was my holy grail. Nothing could beat it. Even Lipikar or Vaseline Body Lotion weren’t strong enough for my skin. Nivea was the only lotion that would actually keep my skin moisturised for an entire day, without being too thick, too greasy, too difficult to apply or too slow absorbing. And now it’s gone 😢 \n\nFortunately, you can still find the old formula on Amazon and in some online stores who are still selling the leftover stock. The new formula has words 72 h  on the packaging. The old formula would say 5 in 1, 48 h. The old formula is still officially available in Ghana and some other markets around the world but in EU, UK, Ukraine it seems to be officially discontinued (so only can be found in old stock). \n\nIf you are curious about the formulas, here are all of the them: \n\nThe old European formula for Nivea light blue body milk/lotion: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C15-19 Alkane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum (this formula should be saved in some museum of skincare and studied by chemists bc it’s so good).\n\nThe new European formula for the same product: \n\nAqua,Glycerin,Alcohol Denat.,Cetearyl Alcohol,Ethylhexyl Cocoate,Glyceryl Stearate SE,Butyrospermum Parkii Butter,Isopropyl Palmitate,Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil,Sodium Hyaluronate,Tocopherol,Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil,Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate,Glyceryl Stearate hydroxypropyl starch phosphate, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerine, phenoxyethanol, linalool, limonene, benzyl alcohol, perfume.\n\nThe US version of the product: \n\nWater, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, C15-19 Alkane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nI’ve also found this version in the Polish market (but they have both the new and the old European formulas, too) - this is one is quite close to the OG formula in terms of the level of hydration and occlusion but less cosmetically-elegant, heavier, waxier, a bit slower to absorb and a bit more difficult to spread: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C1316 Isoparaffin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, AlphaIsomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum.\n\nThe closest thing to the old formula that I’ve found so far is their new Nivea Irresistibly Smooth Body Cream in the light blue jar. The formula is different, slightly less hydrating but close enough. It should be more fast absorbing and easier to apply: \n\nGlycerin, Mineral Oil, Alcohol Denat., Stearyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Microcrystalline Wax, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Oleic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, BHT, Fragrance. - \n\nit’s not available in all countries, only in some. \nThe Polish regional variant is also close to the OG body milk formula but is less cosmetically elegant. \n\nSo since I now know these things, I had to share it with you 😂\n\n",

Some of them contain Paraffinum Liquidum, Dimethicone and C15-19 Alkane, which seem to have been replaced in the new formulation of your lotion with less occlusive stuff. I think the version with glycerine+vit E is supposed to be the heaviest of the bunch, maybe it's worth checking out.  \nAs a more expensive option, you could try the Bioderma Atoderm cream or balm. I had the cream a few years ago and found it more occlusive than Lipikar, so the balm should work even better.",

Next to cleansing, this cream was basically our only skincare product and has been a holy grail for both of us (dry skin, but fairly smooth and calm).

Same problem.\n\nTurns out the formula of the newer tins are totally different than the old ones (see pics and ingredient list down below). Notice the newer formula list is almost twice as long. It went from a nostalgic powdery scent to a disgusting, rancid coconut-like smell which we just can't ignore. Unfortunately, our Nivea era might have just come to an end.

    "body": "Lets discuss a little bit about fuel. I have a modest bugout location with about 10 acres of 40 year growth. I get interested in a prepping subject  (lighting, heating, cooking) and study it mostly until i get bored with it and move on to the next thing. In my studies I try to get the most bang for my buck with low priced quality items or good used items I can refurbish (coleman stoves, lanterns etc) for low cost. Things I consider, cost per therm, initial cost, reliability, ubiquity (one of my top considerations) , ease of maintenance, durability. I have had this barrel of K-1 in my woodshop for 30 years, and have finally used it up when it occurred to me, that this might be a great long term solution for storing energy.\n\nLets start by saying I would love to learn alot more on the subject so am anxious to hear input from someone who actually understands the fuel better than i, so chime in .\n\nThings i found out..\n** Wow those jugs at the hardware store cost a fortune!**\n\nYeah they are, but, K1 for heating isnt subject to the same taxation when delivered by a fuel company. But if you have a container and are willing to buy their minimum delivery amount you can save alot of money. You know whats good to store Kerosene in? Oil drums. Dispensing is easy storage is easy, safer than gasoline propane or butane. Here is a good video on the subject. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08u0NSMtem8\n\nconcept is pretty sound, I like this setup he has created. \n\nId love others opinions on the concept and how hard is it to dispense and use in that way, what would you want to make using fuel from a barrel like this easier?\n\n**What do I do with all of this stuff**\n\n**LIGHTING**\n\nThis is where this story started, I found a lovely old Dietz Cold Pilot kerosene lantern hanging in a barn, was probably 50 years old. I realized how cool the technology, how easy it was to repair and even upgrade, and the love of the soft cool, steady silent light it provides.\n\n#1 rule obviously, ONLY KEROSENE GOES IN KEROSENE LANTERNS DO NOT USE PARAFFIN OIL.\n\nWe tend to play music under the porch in the summer time, and i realized my Coleman white gas are too loud, and in general fragile, impossible to use inside and consume a lot of fuel.\n\nI will let you read some of the information I found on kerosene lanterns, Why trimming your wick properly matters, hours of operation (27 hours on a tank of fuel!)? Hot vs cold pilot whats the difference? Safety with lanterns? \n\nhttps://www.lanternnet.com/\nI have had nothing but top notch support from this place?\nHave an old antique lantern around? order a new drop in burner and clean the glass learn how it works. $10 may be $20 (brass) burner replacement, comes with a loaded wick. Take it out on a windy day, give it a run through. I think you will like it. \n\nI have purchased the old classics like Dietz and the JT Kirkman store brand the only difference is Dietz is for fancy, Kirkman is for work. The kirkmans are functionally identical but come in Galvanized which I personally prefer. \n\n**Whats cooking like on Kerosene**\n\nWell to be honest, most of the world uses kerosene regularly, its hot, adjustable, long burning, and goes a long time on a fill. I had some Amish friends who had a summer kitchen on the house who used a kerosene stove for canning, it was hot, no odor, I was pleased with it but put it in the back of my mind as it was a large appliance and it would take a commitment. Until I discovered, if you look in the right place you can find quality durable stoves for $55. Advantages, you can use it indoors! \n\nenough talking check it out. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngnFTKpRuAo\n\nthis is the $55 model. \n\nI purchased mine here, have had great support and service from this guy, and even picked up one of his model Berkey style filters that I love.\n\nhttps://stpaulmercantile.com/kerosene-cook-stoves-and-oven\n\nNote the ovens made to fit this model, so you could get a kerosene cooktop and oven for it at about $125 total (oven appears to be sold out but he responds quickly to emails)\n\nHere is where it falls apart and I would like your input. \n\n**HEATING**\n\nHere is where I dont know a whole lot \n\nI have one of those 10k btu tower style heaters and a smaller radiant style heater, and while they put out expedient heat, they seem to be really expensive to run? Id love someones experience with using kerosene heating also with biomass..",

    "body": "I had ideal body lotion in my mind and none of body lotions I used before checked all the boxes. I even wrote one post here asking for recommendations, I've tried them - they were causing more acne or were very sticky on my body. My body is acne prone, very dry and I just hate sticky feeling (sensory issues). I wanted something little bit thicker, but not feeling heavy, something very moisturizing and smooth feeling but not sticky, something that would glide across my skin and give a slight healthy glow. Something with simple ingredients list - no Urea, no niacinamide, no heavy oils, parfums, sillicones and all that crap that makes my skin even more sentensized and breaking out. And of course not too expensive. Pretty tough, right? \n\nI found this by a pure luck. Or should I say, this body lotion - found me!! Haha, My dad got this  for his birthday. It was sitting on his night table unused for a month. I mean, the only thing he uses on his body is 3 in 1 body wash hahaha So as I am, a skincare freak I took the bottle and read the ingredients. First things that caught my eyes was simple ingredients list and these components: Glycerin, allantoin, panthenol and parrafinum liquidum. Sounds very simple, hydrating and soothing, plus parrafinum liquidum should lock the moisture in. So I tried it that night and I was in heaven. It was exactly as the body lotion I have dreamed of. Gives that soft, smooth feeling but nothing sticky and spreads so nicely. Also, as I mentioned, very simple ingredients list. My skin has callmed down ever since I started using it and is much clearer. I get very excited to apply this after showering which never happened before. I am on my second bottle now! Plus, it is easly available at DM or Muller drugstores. \n\nFULL INCI: Aqua, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, Allantoin, Panthenol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Carbomer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum\n\nPrice: midrange, 4.75€ for 250 mL. \n\nWhat is your take on this body lotion?",

I wash my hair in the morning so I don’t really have time to do a two-step routine for my hair, or I’m really too lazy for it. Also I feel like manipulating my hair twice in the shower ends up with more hair on my drainage cap.\n\nBut the thing is I feel like my hair has been breaking and falling quite a bit, which I think is because it’s too dry and not properly conditioned. So I’m actually considering co-washing instead. \n\nI’ve had these two conditioners in my closet for a while that I have not used, and I’ve looked through the ingredients list, would they be ok to use for co-washing?\n\n**[Redken Frizz Dismiss Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/Redken-Dismiss-Conditioner-protection-smoothing/dp/B00UJZRO50)**\n\n> Aqua / Water / Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Paraffinum Liquidum / Mineral Oil / Huile Minerale, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Parfum / Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, PEG / PPG / Polybutylene Glycol-8 / 5 / 3 Glycerin, Pentaclethra Macroloba Oil / Pentaclethra Macroloba Seed Oil, Hexyl Cinnamal, BHT, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n\n\nThis one looks quite fine to me? It seems to be a silicone-free conditioner and I read that Behentrimonium Chloride is quite good to have in a hair cleanser and it doesn’t seem to have any problematic ingredients in the top five.\n\n**[Klorane Conditioner with Pomegranate ](https://www.amazon.com/Klorane-Conditioner-Pomegranate-5-1-fl/dp/B000Q34W0K)**\n\n> Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Alcohol, Ceteareth-33, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Isopropyl Alcohol, Methyparaben, Punica Granatum extract, Red 4 (CI 14700), Trideceth-12\n\n\nIt seems the only problem for this one could be the Amodimethicone? Which I gather from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/?st=JGTIBFB0&sh=8c65316e) that it can be hard to wash off but does not cause a build up. I have briefly looked up the rest of the ingredients and they don’t seem to have serious red flags (except maybe the parabens). Is it still ok to use for cowash?\n\nI plan to shampoo with a sulfate-free shampoo once a week.",

So, I have dehydrated acne-prone skin and am, despite initially thinking otherwise, probably sensitive to fatty alcohols and certain fatty acids commonly indicated as comedogenic. I've tried a ton of products that break me out in small bumps that come to a head.\n\nI've recently taken to moisturizing with just oils over damp skin, which at least stops me from having that tight skin feeling. Interestingly, coconut oil does not break me out. This keeps me from getting the bumps.\n\nI **LOVE** Nivea Soft. It leaves my skin smooth and soothed, calming down PIE and making imperfections like bumps and pores less visible. It works much better than oil and doesn't leave me shiny. It feels that my skin is \"thicker\" and more resilient. However, I'm pretty sure it breaks me out.\n\nThese are the ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum, **Myristyl Alcohol**, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat, **Stearic Acid**, **Myristyl Myristate**, Cera Microcristallina, **Glyceryl Stearate**, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Lanolin Alcohol (Eucerit®)**, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Dimethicone, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Salicylate, Parfum.\n\nI've bolded the ones that I think are problematic. Sudocrem also breaks me out and it contains lanolin. However, it also seems that these are the ingredients that keep my skin soft and looking good. I'm wondering, are there any emollients that produce this effect without being comedogenic?\n\nGel moisturizers like Sebamed don't give me that soft effect. In addition, they also pill when dry, fall off my face and make makeup application very difficult.\n\nI'm currently moisturizing with a mix of water, glycerin and grapeseed oil, and topping it with coconut oil. I thought that glycerin, being a humectant, would be the key, but it's not doing much besides reducing tightness. I'm open to making my own cosmetics.\n\nEDIT: If you can help, point me to specific ingredients rather than products because the products available to me in Europe are different.",

I use a mix of Vaseline and graphite powder for inside the spring barrels (some use molybdenum grease). On slower moving and large gears that can rub against each other I use Vaseline (probably not necessary). The only thing I recommend that you don’t oil is the gear paw. Oil increases the chances of it slipping  and rapidly releasing the springs tension through the handle. You can also oil the pivot points on your tone arm if it’s feeling stiff.",

We did blood test and nothing showed up, the vet said it's probs stress so we introduced him new foods.\n\nHe still didn't eat. We had to force him to eat even a bit and had to use a syringe to get him to drink even some water.\n\nTook him back to the vet. They gave him IV fluids because he was dehydrated, and cleaned and checked his teeth in case tooth pain was stopping him from eating. After I insisted, they also took X-ray photos and one of the photos (picture 1 below) he had a sternal dislocation but the vet said she is almost certain it is an old injury, from perhaps since he was a kitten, and it doesn't seem to cause him pain. He doesn't mind when the bump on his chest caused by this is pressed.\nIt also showed he had a bit of osteoarthritis on his back legs (picture 3) He is getting mild pain medication for that. \n\nThe photos also showed he was constipated (picture 2) so the vet percribed him paraffin oil. After two doses of this, my cat pooped twice. But he still does not eat or drink. \n\nSo basically, still no answer as to what's wrong. We are just treating symptoms. I am losing my mind I am so worried. \n\nWhat tests do I request at the vet? I believe we could still try ultrasound but the closest is 120km away and my cat gets stressed during car rides. The vet said they do not recommend sedating my cat for the car ride there as my cat is already so weak. \nI will of course take him there, but before that I would like to ask you all for any advice on what to do. What test do I ask for? Please help me. \nThis has been so expensive and I feel like I pay so much money for no answers.",

Constantly drying your skin will promote more perspiration and will prevent any excreted toxins from being re-absorbed. \n\nThe essential oils sold in most sauna stores is to be used for aromatherapy by adding a few drops to a bucket of water, then scooping some scented water onto the rocks. It is expensive because it is so concentrated. If sauna stores sell oil for wood, I am not aware of this. I've seen \"sauna cleaner\" but you can easily make your own instead",

Flawless Finish (satin) Foundation on Amazon, the first ingredients after water are the same two silicones as the airbrush f'n! Then there are a few other silicones in lesser amounts, which is promising solve that's likely the reason why the stuff was so silky.\n\n\nI'm slightly worried by the ingredient list being different on e.l.f's website (without as much silicone), but it's only £9 & worth a shot because I've been looking for a dupe for EVER. They said, it would be really sad if they changed the formula and the old one is a dupe, but at least we can hoarde it off Amazon nice & early...\n\n\nI've tried the Boots hydra-something foundation, it's nice but not the same texture. IT Cosmetics BB cream has the same coverage as the airbrush f'n but in a cream formula, so you could try that with The Ordinary's silicone primer (or mix foundation drops directly into the primer itself?)\n\n\n\nBTW I think we should all be contacting Boots to ask them to bring this stuff back, it worked with Cadbury for Wispa! \n\n\nExcept they went viral and this probably won't, but it's worth a shot 😅\n\n\nI just need a dupe for the discontinued black Soap & Glory perfume now, I've been looking for that for a frikkin' decade...\n\n\nINGREDIENTS\nWater (Aqua), Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Isododecane, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Boron Nitride, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Magnesium Stearate, Magnesium Palmitate, Magnesium Sulfate, Phenoxyethanol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, PEG/PPG-15/15 Dimethicone, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum), Silica.

    "body": "Hi guys! I'm looking for some help with with my redness. I think it's unlikely that it's rosacea, it's more like a rosey tone across my cheeks and no flushes. You guys would laugh at me if I posted a picture but it's something I care about - I'm sure you understand. \n\nI'm primarily looking for soothing and calming ingredients as I suspect I might just be dry and sensitive, as opposed to wanting to just target visible redness. Right now I'm focusing on finding a soothing (and preferably pretty occlusive) moisturizer for wintertime.\n\n**Skintype:** Dry, very prone to redness (often get beardburn from my partner) and I think I'm prone to clogging as squalane broke me out. I live in a very dry climate north of Sweden.\n\n**Current routine:** AM: splash of water -> CeraVe moisturizing Cream. PM: Cleanse with L300 intensive moisture cleansing mousse -> PC's 2% BHA every 5 days or so -> CeraVe cream -> Thin layer of Vaseline sometimes (I add a morning cleanse when I do this)\n\nI'm interested in replacing the CeraVe cream with A-Derma Dermalibour+ barrier cream for daytime. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this as I haven't found much myself. It's marketed as a \"second skin\"-type of product, which I'm not sure sounds very comfortable but might be good for daytime to protect against the harsh weather and my partners beard LOL. It has collodial oatmeal but not sure if it's a significant amount. I haven't seen anyone talk about this product so I'll include an ingredients list for it\n\nIngredients for A-Derma Dermalibour+ barrier cream: *WATER (AQUA), MINERAL OIL (PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, GLYCERIN, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, ISODODECANE, ZEA MAYS (CORN) STARCH (ZEA MAYS STARCH), ZINC OXIDE, PEG-22/DODECYL GLYCOL COPOLYMER, BEESWAX (CERA ALBA), AVENA SATIVA (OAT) LEAF/STEM EXTRACT (AVENA SATIVA LEAF/STEM EXTRACT), CETYL ALCOHOL, CITRIC ACID, COPPER SULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, O-CYMEN-5-OL, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, XANTHAN GUM, ZINC SULFATE* \n\nAlso been eyeing some Avéne and LRP products but I'm not sure if their redness-lines are more for targeting visible redness by reducing bloodflow to visible capillaries (if I'm misinformed that this is even a thing please correct me, I've just read it a few times) so I'm hesitant to buy them. I'll take any recommendations for products, ingredients or lines! I really like pharmacy brands.\n\nSidenote: If you recognize this post I posted something similar in a helpthread at SCA but was unfortunately only recommended american brands.",

    "body": "Hello,\n\n\nI've got a question regarding this body lotion - it's from a European brand Mixa called Panthenol Comfort but also named in some countries as Mixa Atopiance. It's marketed for dry and atopy prone skin for both babies and adults. It costs around 6$ for 400ml. Now, my skin is normal leaning to oily but dehydrated a good bit, handles actives really well and I get maybe a couple pimples in a month, so not overly problematic. \n\n\nI'm currently in the market for a nice rich (preferably cheap) moisturizer for my PM routine and I bought this one based on the ingredients and the price, primarily for my month old big leg tattoo but it seems to me there shouldn't be any issues using it on my face as well. I put it on last night after cleansing and a HA face mist and this morning my face felt nice and nourished, no breakouts or whiteheads.\n\n\nSo my question is, what do you think about its ingredients? Do you think it could be harmful to consistently use it in on my face in the PM routine? Here's the ingredients list:\n\n\n**AQUA / WATER • GLYCERIN • PETROLATUM • PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM / MINERAL OIL • NIACINAMIDE • GLYCERYL STEARATE • CETYL ALCOHOL • PEG-40 STEARATE • BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER • CETYL PALMITATE • DIMETHICONE • ASCORBYL PALMITATE • CHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE • CITRIC ACID • CORIANDRUM SATIVUM SEED OIL / CORIANDER SEED OIL • ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM SEED OIL • GLYCINE SOJA OIL / SOYBEAN OIL • PANTHENOL • PRUNUS ARMENIACA KERNEL OIL / APRICOT KERNEL OIL • RIBES NIGRUM SEED OIL / BLACK CURRANT SEED OIL • SORBITAN TRISTEARATE • TOCOPHEROL (F.I.L. B194118/2)**",

The result is comfortable, lightweight 4-layer masks (weighing only between 3.5 and 4 grams each, depending on the model), yet meeting and exceeding FFP2 specifications (\\*).\n\nEven though r/Masks4All is a mostly US-centric community, we believe our products might be of interest to some of you who are UK/EU-based, and we would like to offer you guys a special **20% discount** on our packs of 25 and 50 masks.

    "body": "**WHAT IS MINERAL OIL?**\nMineral oil (paraffinum liquidum, in Latin) is a clear oil that is often found in beauty products, especially leave-on skincare products like moisturizers. You may also hear it being referred to as Petrolatum, which is the same thing as mineral oil, just at a different thickness/texture. You all know Vaseline, right? Vaseline is Petrolatum--that gooey, not-quite-liquid-not-quite-solid freak of nature product. You know, that magical stuff that has a billion uses? That's mineral oil at work. \n\n**WHERE IT GETS ITS BAD REPUTATION:**\nWell, when people hear that it's a by-product of petroleum or crude oil, they tend to Freak. Out. (even though it's \"all-natural,\" hahaha!). I'm telling you now: don't worry about it. This doesn't mean you're putting gasoline on your face!\n\nThere are different grades of mineral oil, and beauty products are made with Cosmetic Grade mineral oil, which has been HIGHLY refined and purified of all the impurities that it collects when it's in the ground. (For the record, plants have to be cleaned and purified when they come out of the ground too). It's not \"dirty\" and you're not using the same Industrial Grade version that's going into the gas tanks of your cars. Mineral oil that passes these standards is certified as USP (United States Pharmacopeia), or BP (British Pharmacopeia) in the UK. It's not exactly printed on product labels (because that's unnecessary), but if you're buying a beauty product from a reputable brand or store, you're gonna be good to go.\n\nI'm pretty unfamiliar with indie skincare brands and those who sell skincare products in Etsy shops, so if you buy or sell skincare products on there, I'd love to hear more about that!\n\nYou can also buy Cosmetic Grade mineral oil in huge bottles at most drugstores.\n\n**THE BENEFITS OF MINERAL OIL IN SKINCARE:**\nMineral oil is a superstar when it comes to helping dry skin retain moisture and softening the skin. It mainly helps maintain the skin's moisture balance, keeping the hydration in while blocking the stuff you don't want, out. It's in a lot of beauty products because it's not likely to cause allergic reactions in people, and it works! \n\n**BUSTING THE MYTHS\n\n\"Does mineral oil clog your pores and/or cause acne?\"**\n\nI don't know where this started, but many websites spread the belief that it is comedogenic (clogs pores). On a scientific level, the molecules are too big to fit into your pores, so it's basically impossible. Granted, everyone's skin is unique and there's always a possibility that something will react, but for the most part you're in the clear (literally, clear skin, aha?).\n\nThat being said, it can feel heavy sometimes, depending on how much you put on and how oily your skin is. Using a moisturizer that's too thick and rich for your skin type could potentially clog your pores, but that's not the fault of the mineral oil itself. It's not an ingredient that's going to cause inflammation in the pores and cause acne in that way.\n\n**\"Does mineral oil prevent the skin from breathing?\"**\n\nLOL, Imagine each of your pores breathing--wouldn't that get very loud? Skin doesn't breathe, but if it did, you'd have nothing to worry about! Mineral oil isn't like a thick wall on your face, blocking everything out in that way. It's kind of like silicone, in that it creates a moisture barrier to protect your skin, but it's not like you're wearing a mask. Think of it as a net, like putting a tennis racket in front of your face. It'll catch the bad stuff, but you can clearly still see and feel the environment through it.\n\n**\"Does mineral oil cause cancer?\"**\n\nAs seen with parabens, people like to read the abstracts of studies, rather than the actual study itself, and MCFREAKIN LOSE IT. Yes, mineral oil is listed in the *2011 Substances Listed in the Thirteenth Report on Carcinogens,* but if you actually look into it and read the mineral oil section, it's specified as **the untreated and mildly treated versions** such as those found in **metalworking and the newspaper printing industry.** As stated above, Mineral oil has different grades for various industries and markets. So this study doesn't apply to the beauty world at all.\n\nThink about it: Cosmetic Grade Mineral oil has been approved by government agencies. Do you really think they would want to cause your harm? No! People want to create things that will help other people! Also, from a legal standpoint, why would a company put a dangerous ingredient in their skincare products? That's just asking for a lawsuit! Before mineral oil goes into any of your beauty products, it has to pass certain testing and regulations. Also, if you look in any aesthetician textbook, they'll have nothing but good things to say about mineral oil.\n\nIf you're ever in doubt about something--and this goes for anything--look to the pros and the experts, rather than the first result in Google. Scare tactics and crazy headlines get all the views--they're clickbait, don't believe them! I know when we were writing research papers in school, generally if a lot of sources said the same thing there's a good chance it's true, but that doesn't apply to certain \"widely accepted myths\" of the beauty world.  (Also, don't read the abstracts of studies).\n\n(The short answer: NO)\n\n**SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH / ARTICLES** \n\n* Beautypedia: Vaseline Petroleum Jelly\n* Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary: Mineral Oil\n* Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary: Petrolatum\n* EWG: Mineral Oil\n* EWG: Petrolatum\n* Immunetra: The Myths About Mineral Oil\n* Live Chat: Controversial Ingredients (Or Why Your Makeup Isn't Killing You)\n* Milady Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary \n* Paula's Choice: Is Mineral Oil Bad For Skin?\n* Personal Care Truth: Mineral Oil\n* Substances Listed in the Thirteenth Report on Carcinogens: Mineral Oil\n* The Beauty Brains: Top 5 Myths About Mineral Oil\n* WebMD: Mineral Oil (Topical)\n\nToo Long; Didn't Read: DON'T BE SCARED OF MINERAL OIL\n\nI hope this post was helpful to you! If you have any more questions on mineral oil, feel free to ask me in a comment below and I'll answer the best I can!\n\n***\n\nThis was originally posted to my blog (www.sammithebeautybuff.com), but I just thought I would share the information I found when doing my research since you all are just as nerdy about skincare as I am. (I didn't want to break the rules and spam my blog, so I just copy-and-pasted the text here). I know there is already a FAQ on mineral oil on here, but I figured the spread of factual information can never be bad. (But if that's not allowed, feel free to reject this post. I won't be offended--just figured I should contribute instead of lurking for once!)\n\nIf you've found contradictory information about mineral oil elsewhere, PLEASE let me know! I don't want to spread misinformation (there's enough of that on the internet already). You guys kind of inspired this post (as well as previous ones--I did a whole post on lemons in skincare, too!)",

Never used Bio-Oil myself but was underwhelmed by the ingredients when considering it as a leave on treatment.\n\nI rate calendula extract and Roman chamomile as soothing/ calming ingredients: some find lavender, rosemary oil, fragrance or colours are irritating so that seems a strange mix. Vitamin E is solid but in loads of products, the retinyl esters (including palmitate) have limited research backing them so I always want to see a percentage. Not sure why bisabolol is listed under the oil base, it's one of the key actives in German chamomile. Bisabolol and calendula have antimicrobial activity.",

I am looking to get it cut short in a style similar to this one:  [https://imgur.com/a/8GzdNt2](https://imgur.com/a/8GzdNt2)\n\nThe best styling products for my fine hair have a matte finish - usually matte clays. Unfortunately, I have seborrheic dermatitis, which means that products containing almost any oil will give me dandruff. The only oils that are safe for seborrheic dermatitis are squalane oil, mineral oil, and MCT oil. (Essential oils are fine. Also, see the edit below.)\n\n(For those interested, a lot of great information on seborrheic dermatitis can be found in this blog post [https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) and this ingredient checker [https://www.sezia.co/](https://www.sezia.co/).)\n\nFor example, the beeswax that seems to be present in almost all matte clays is a problem. The closest product I've found that's safe for seborrheic dermatitis is the Aquage Texturizing Wax\n\nIngredient List:\n\nWater (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Oleth-5, Dea-Oleth-10 Phosphate, Oleth-20, Otylacrylamide/Acrylates/Butylaminoethyl Methacrylate Copolymer, DEA-Oleth-3 Phosphate, PVP, Fragrance (Parfum), Ascophyllum Nudosum Extract, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Gellidiela Acerosa Extract, Hypnea Musciformis Extract, Neptune Kelp Extract, Palmaria Palmata Extract, Sargassum Filipendula Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Sorbitol, Cholesteryl Oleyl Carbonate, Cholesteryl Chloride, Cholesteryl Nonanoate, Aminomethyl Propanol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Mica, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Blue 1 (CI42090).\n\nbut this product still adds too much shine for my hair. (Also can anyone tell me which ingredients give the product hold??)\n\n\\*I am wondering if it is possible to make the product I'm looking for myself. In short, the parameters are:\n\n1. matte finish\n2. medium-strong hold\n3. Passes the ingredient checker here ([https://www.sezia.co/](https://www.sezia.co/)) - in particular, practically no oils (that means no beeswax) besides squalane oil, mineral oil, and MCT oil. (Essential oils are fine.)\n\nAny other suggestions or pieces of advice are welcome.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I just realized that Carnauba Wax and Ozokerite Wax look to be safe for seborrheic dermatitis & may be able to provide hold. (As used in this product: [https://www.imperialbarberproducts.com/shop/hair/matte-pomade-paste/](https://www.imperialbarberproducts.com/shop/hair/matte-pomade-paste/).) Carnauba wax is safe because it contains fatty acids in the C26-30 range and the fungus causing seborrheic dermatitis can only metabolize fatty acids in the C11-24 range.\n\nEdit2: Disregard the previous edit. Carnauba wax is not safe for seborrheic derrmatitis (but Ozokerite wax is.)",

The problem is not so much the oils but the emulsifiers; most formulas I've found use emulsifiers that are not FA safe and I haven't done enough research to figure out how to substitute FA safe copolymers.\n\nJust as an example, Making Cosmetics has a formula for Mattifying Hair Cream that sounds very much like what you want, but I don't think any of the emulsifiers are FA safe so you'd have to research that.

What was left was occasional hormonal acne and blackheads.  \nAround two weeks ago I decided to try OCM. I have bought Nivea baby oil (ingredients:Paraffinum Liquidum, Prunu Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Parfum). I never patch test (yea i know, i know...) because I never had any weird reactions before. So I tried OCM and was blown away because my skin was so soft and I was getting a ton of grits. I did OCM like this: apply oil on dry face, wipe of makeup (if there is any or else I'd put on oil only once), apply oil again rub it in for a minute or more, wipe off with microfiber cloth and follow with gel cleanser. Everything was ok until a week later. I developed a lot of cystic acne and white heads. It was a horror story. First I thought my new night moisturiser was breaking me out because I refused to think it was OCM. Unfortunately it was, so I stopped. My face is now slowly getting better but I am left with PIH and my skin looks worse than before. Here are the [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/DgNZz). The before pictures were actually taken on a bad day when I had hormonal acne and I never expected to look back a week later and think that my skin looks good before.  \n  \nMoral of the story? Always patch test even if you never had any reactions. Also any advice on how to heal my skin? I also don't want to give up on OCM, but I will patch test before. Is there even such thing as an oil that doesn't brake out anyone?  \n    \nTLDR: Used Nivea baby oil for a week without patch testing and got the worst breakout. \n",

I have very dry, dehydrated, sensitive skin and a budget of no more than £25 to spend on a new face sunscreen. I am based in the UK.\n\nI have heard good things about  the La Roche-Posay Anthelios Ultra-Light Invisible Sun Cream SPF50, but I was surprised to see that its second largest ingredient is Alcohol Denat. Surely this would be very drying?\n\nI have also read good things about the Inkey List SPF but it is sold out online on Boots UK.\n\nI was recommended Uriage Bariéderm Cica-cream with copper-zinc spf50+. Its second largest ingredient is Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), which sounds promising, and its on Amaon UK for a fiver which is amazing. However, it does contain citric acid, which I think may irritate my skin (this is just a theory of mine, but my skin suddenly stopped tolerating Simple moisutiser products and I wondered if it was the citric acid in them that contributed to this).\n\nCetaphil Defence Moisturier SPF50 also looks good and I know it is a well-liked brand. I am just very worried about getting irritated eyes again!\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions regarding which of the above products I should go for (I am leaning towardds Uriage just based on price) please let me know. Or, any other SPF products you had success with which did not irritate your eyes! Thank you.",

The texture is absolutely lovely, it sinks into the skin so fast! Absolutely no sting to the eyes, too.\n\n2) Boots [No7 Lip & Eye SPF](https://www.boots.com/no7-anti-ageing-shimmering-lip-and-eye-screen-spf-30-10140541?cm_mmc=bmm-buk-google-ppc-_-PLAs-_-(GB:Whoop!)+No7-_-(GB:Whoop!)+Boots+Shopping+-+Category+-+No7+-+Desktop&gclid=Cj0KCQiAs5eCBhCBARIsAEhk4r4QanJxU79HfL228w31eYHd8K3bSQpIdO2vU19yXMn0QRSlHJJhBa8aAhbDEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)\\- this is great for spreading right around the eye area but a bit of a faff for applying to the whole face. Great for the specific area alone though.  My main issue with this is because it has a slight shimmer/tint to it, I get a bit of a crease in the eyelid after a while.\n\nI also quite like[this one by Nivea](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nivea-SPF-Face-Mousse-Moisturizer/dp/B07BCWYKYS/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=nivea+face+spf&qid=1615254666&sr=8-3) but in conjunction with moisturiser, it actually makes my face a little greasy, which is quite some feat!

Also if occlusion is very important to you I know the Uriage xemose cream and xemose oil balm are also great! I just can’t find them easily where I’m located.

    "body": "To cut a long story short, I think my skin barrier is really damaged. It’s behaving weirdly and I don’t know what to do about it.\nI’m 31, female, and have pretty sensitive/allergic type skin with a history of eczema (although never really had it on my face).\nI was ticking along happily for years using Avene Tolerance Extreme moisturiser every day. To my horror this product was discontinued and the replacement they brought out seems to cause irritation, flakiness, itchy areas etc. As I’m so sensitive to products I could not find a replacement that didn’t cause irritation. I tried everything, natural oils, mineral oil/Vaseline over a humectant like glycerin on damp skin, other French pharmacy products like LRP and Bioderma, and all the drugstore favourites like e45, aveeno etc. All seemed to make me drier and more irritated after a few uses. As I had no other option, I continued to use the new formulation of the Avene.\n\nNow I seem to have got myself into a cycle of irritated, flaky skin, which I hate so I try to gently exfoliating whilst washing with water.... which causes more irritation and flaking, and the cycle goes on.\n\nMiraculously I’ve managed to obtain a tube of my old holy grail Avene moisturiser from eBay and have been using it for about 6 days now with little improvement. Still flaky, still sore and eczema-like. The ingredients of this cream are: AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA). GLYCERIN. MINERAL OIL (PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM). SQUALANE. CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS SEED OIL). CYCLOPENTASILOXANE. GLYCERYL STEARATE. CYCLOHEXASILOXANE. SODIUM CARBOMER. TITANIUM DIOXIDE. WATER (AQUA). \n\nThe new version of this cream, which really irritates me, has swapped out the mineral oil for Shea butter and uses behenyl alcohol as the emulsifier. I’m sure I’m irritated by one of those. I see other people have issues with fatty alcohols. Anyway, it’s nice to have my old product back but I still look like crap and it’s really affecting my confidence at work :(\n\nHow long will my skin barrier take to heal? Should I avoid washing? as water seems to make it drier and more sore, even if I moisturise immediately!\n\nThank you so much in advance. This has been a struggle for a really long time!",

        "body": "I have eczema and it's not on my face, but my face is quite dry now. The fatty alcohols like behenyl alcohol are not drying. They break some people out, which is different. People hear alcohol and panic. Shea is not drying either. Usually the problem be a breakout. You could be allegic of course. \n\nIs the old tube helping or are you just dryer and the old products are just not up to the job?. One thing that can go very wrong is humectants (glycerine, hyaluronic acids, glycols) in a dry environment. Maybe the glincerin is not working as it is dryer season or your skin has changed.   If there is not enough moisture in the environment humectants will pull moisture out of the deeper layers of the skin. Vaseline without the glycerin might work better, still over damp skin. I had to reduce the amount of products with humectants that I use on my body for eczema. That helped. I also use a steam humidifier (Vicks) and that helps a lot.  Steam is a lot cleanser and more effective  than cool options.",

My face looks red, lack luster and I have clogged pores on my forehead, a place that’s never had them. I’ve come to the conclusion that I will not use a damn thing besides water and maybe a basic oil cleanser for when I wear makeup. My skin looked better this morning until I took a shower. I can’t even handle hot water on my face right now. No acids, no exfoliation and very basic items for at least a month, that’s my plan. I’m also going to work on very very gently touching my face, no rubbing whatsoever. \n\nI’ll be layering on the aquaphor tonight for sure!!!! \n\nAlso, I got rid of the clarisonic yesterday. My husband bought it for me for Christmas and I wasn’t even using it that much but I think that and the acids was just overkill. So I refuse to keep something that cost $179 and only be able to use it once or twice a week, what a waste!! I’d rather use a microfiber cloth to physically exfoliate. \n\nI keep reading less is more and before I started reading about acids my routine was very basic. Some people may be able to slather on acids twice a day and use a Clarisonic (looking at you YouTube gurus) but my skin is clearly no where near as resilient as I thought it was. \n\nKeep us posted on what you end up doing to repair your moisture barrier.

If needed, extinguish near an open door or window. We often burn multiple lamps and have zero issues. \n\nAlso, when buying a used lamp, I spend a large amount of time cleaning them before burning. I clean the burner and the glass. Dawn dish soap and water. A toothbrush is great to clean the old gunk off of the burner. A baby bottle brush is great to clean out the tank. If needed, vinegar can be used in the tank as well…let it soak. A new wick is always installed. You might be smelling the old fuel…who knows what was used in the past. Last option, buy a new burner. I like the solid brass antiqued versions at Imperial Lighting.\n\nGood luck!!",

        "body": "It should not be this bad, something is wrong. I use cheap red dye kerosene from a gas pump in 3 lamps at once and it is okay-ish. I also use [this super cheap air quality monitor](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806938191206.html) to make sure I'm doing alright.\n\nFirst, make sure you are not setting the flame way too high. Wick should be set quite low during normal operation and it should not be visible. Flame should be 1\" 1/2 - 2\" high in your lamp at max. Flame should look quite tame and not \"dancing\" like crazy. I know it produces very little light then but this is how it is with these lamps, just accept it.\n\nSecond, I was experimenting with my air quality monitor and I noticed that air quality drops very fast the first minute after I light up my lamps. Then I open up the windows and an outside patio door to ventilate my room and get back air quality back to normal. Then after the lamps heats up I can close the windows and the door and air stays normal. I live in a 19th century home though which is slightly drafty. I have a very small almost air tight room (bathroom) and I noticed that running oil lamps there for a long period of time is makes it quite bad, nothing can be done with it apart from opening a window.\n\nIf that not helps but you still want an oil lamp then you may want to look into Alladin oil lamps. They run much hotter and are more efficient, therefore they produce almost no fumes. Alladin mantle lamps are also MUCH brighter.",

Unfortunately they all contain cetyl alcohol (sorry to get your hopes up).\n\nCandidate #1: **QV Cream**\n\n> Aqua (water), paraffinum liquidum, glycerin, petrolatum, cetearyl alcohol, squalane, dimethicone, ceteth-20, glyceryl stearate SE, stearic acid, laureth-3, glyceryl stearate, methylparaben, dichlorobenzyl alcohol.\n\nI actually went and bought this today and used it once. I haven't used the Nivea Creme, so I can't make a decent comparison. Not gonna lie, the QV Cream looks like lard. It's absolutely *white*, like glowingly white. I don't know how they do it but it's so white. And it's pretty thick too, no trouble smearing it on though. Smells a bit plasticky, but it's quite subtle and disappears very quickly. It's also pretty greasy, but I did use more than usual.\n\nCandidate #2: **Ego Skin Cream**\n\n>Aqua (water), glyceryl stearate SE, glycerin, paraffinum liquidum, cetyl alcohol, sodium stearate, methylparaben, citric acid, propylparaben, parfum, acid red 51.\n\nPretty much a scaled back version of the QV Cream. It contains fragrance and colouring which is just a massive \"wat\" since Ego loves to tout how their products are suited for sensitive skin.\n\nCandidate #2.5 **QV Hand Cream**\n\n> Aqua (water), glyceryl stearate SE, glycerin, paraffinum liquidum, cetyl alcohol, methyparaben, citric acid, propylparaben.\n\nI'm probably the one of the few crazy enough to put non-face-formulated products on their face but hey, these aren't foreign ingredients. I've seen them all in facial products before (and if you notice, the \"2.5\" is because the formula is shockingly similar). I don't really see a difference between the Ego Skin Cream and the QV Hand Cream except for less preservatives and the absence of potential irritants.\n_______________________________________\nJust as a random aside, I think this is one of the rare times where being Aussie actually comes at an advantage (however small it may be). Ego (who also owns QV and SunSense) is Australian owned and as far as I can see, they're products are available in pretty much every chemist under our Australian sun (and sheesh, what a scorcher it was today right?). Ego does sell their stuff overseas, I've seen a section of their website dedicated to worldwide queries.",

Also the fact that I have a handwashing OCD, which escalated to max level during pregnancy and now post partum. And the bougie moisturizers were not helping my dry, cracked, sometimes bleeding palms. I tried lot of body butters, even home made ghee to heal, before I resorted to nivea cocoa nourish, which healed my hands. So yeah, it's decided. Will use nivea/ Vaseline type moisturizers and save my money to buy actual perfumes. No more chasing bbw discounts and glitch sales from now on😂",

    "body": "So I've long had a superstition that Carmex In The ~~Tub~~ Jar was the best Carmex. Over several courses of Accutane, Carmex has emerged as the *only* lip balm that has ever worked for me, and I keep a bit of a stash. However I was assured by several friends what I was imagining it, and they're all identical. \n\nRecently I lost my tub and I was forced to pull out a tube, and I've just been feeling like it wasn't cutting it for me. Inspired by a conversation I had here about trying to zero in on which ingredients my skin might get along with particularly well I decided to actually check the ingredients and found that, sure enough, the formulas are different:\n\n**Classic jar:** Petrolatum, Lanolin, Cetyl Esters, Paraffin, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter, Cera Alba, Camphor, Menthol, Salicylic Acid, Vanillin, Parfum, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool, Geraniol, Citronellol.\n\n**Applicator tube:** Petrolatum, Lanolin, Cetyl Esters, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter, Cera Alba, Paraffinum Liquidum, Camphor, Menthol, Salicylic Acid, Vanillin, Parfum, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool, Geraniol, Citronellol.\n\nAnd just for the record, the **Click-Stick** *(I couldn't find the info for the original stick, only the flavoured ones, so there are some discrepancies here with fragrances that can be overlooked)*: Petrolatum, Lanolin, Euphorbia Cerifera Cera, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ozokerite, Benzophenone-3, Paraffin, Cetyl Esters, Cera Alba, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter, Parfum, Myristate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Menthol, Ethyl Vanillin, Vanillin, Salicylic Acidlimnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Camphor, Isopropyl Myristate, PPG-3 Benzyl Ether Myristate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Menthol, Ethyl Vanillin, Vanillin, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\nSome of the differences are fairly minor and I'm sure are related mostly to the texture/melting point of the product needing to be different to function in different applicators, but I'm wondering if anyone here has any theories as to *why* the jar might work so much better for me?\n\nFor example, I always thought part of the reason I liked Carmex so much was because of the salicylic acid softening chapped skin, but I now see it's a low-ranking ingredient across the formulas and barely rates a mention in the click-stick (I've never been a fan). \n\nI am slowly trying to make a mental inventory of ingredients that do and don't seem to work with my skin type.   \n\nAny thoughts of experiences?",

        "body": "The ingredients of the jar and tube look the same, just rearranged slightly (tell me if I'm missing something here); as you mentioned, this is probably because the original formula would likely be too thick to squeeze out of a tube. I've always much preferred the jar, too, and it's just because I feel like the slightly thicker formula stays put better and thus hydrates a bit longer. But I don't know that such a slight change would actually have any real impact - it may really just be a texture preference changing our perception.",

    "body": "So my mom recently has asked me to help her find some more affordable skin care products. She currently uses Yon-Ka products. I told her to try the silk naturals super serum, some avene retinol, some spf, Cerave cream and a weekly Lactic Acid peel. As for the cleanser I am stumped! [This](http://www.yonkausa.com/product/cleansing-lotion) is the current cleanser she uses from Yon-Ka. It needs to be a detergent free cleanser because her face doesn't like soap products too much.\n\nHere are the ingredients in the Yon-Ka cleanser: Water/Aqua, Mineral Oil/Paraffinum Liquidum, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Algin, Phenoxyethanol, Peg-35 Castor Oil, Chlorphenesin, Peg-40 Castor Oil, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Lactic Acid, Borneol, Fragrance/Parfum, Blue 1/Ci 42090, Alpha-Isomethylionone, Coumarin.\n\nAlso has anyone used [Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Rapid-Wrinkle-Repair/dp/B005OLQJGE/ref=pd_sbs_bt_2). It has Retinol in it and I'm thinking that may be easier for her to use than the Retinaldehyde in Avene and Osmosis products.",

        "body": "It's a fine product, it's a weak retinoid derivative. \n\n\n If she wants to see results in a more timely fashion, then using a product with retinaldehyde ( there are more than just avene and osmosis, I just don't know any off the top of my head) really is the better option ( unless she wants to get a script for one of the stronger retinoids). \n\n\nThe cleanser looks like it would be for drier skin types due to the emollients in there plus the mineral oi. The chrophenesin  is an antifungal/antibacterial but is used internally as a muscle relaxant. Seems like something odd to add in there, but I'm not a formulations expert haha.  There's lactic acid in there, but I don't know if it's used for exfoliation---the cleanser pH would need to be no more than 4 for it to be effective. \n\n\nAnyhow, I think a moisturizing cleanser would be good. Maybe something like Clinique Extra Mild Liquid Facial Soap, one of the GoW creamy cleansers, or even just Cerave Hydrating.",
