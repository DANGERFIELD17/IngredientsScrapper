    "body": "Background to this text post: \n\nI had made two replies -- [here is the first comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ugucv/spending_that_much_on_moisturizer_is_stupid_i/cei011t) and [this is my second comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ugucv/spending_that_much_on_moisturizer_is_stupid_i/ceihi8p) -- to two comments that a person made on a post in this subreddit.  Doing that research inspired me to make this post.\n\nFirstly, Lancome is owned by L'oreal.  An example of research that L'oreal has done is with stem cells and [the first L'oreal brand product that benefited from that is Lancome's Absolue Precious Cells](http://www.loreal.com/research-innovation/push-back-the-boundaries-of-knowledge/the-revelation-of-stem-cells.aspx).  In fact, [Lancome is a L'oreal Luxe brand](http://www.loreal.com/Brands.aspx?topcode=CorpTopic_Brand).  \n\nThere is no guarantee that the L'oreal products work exactly the same as the Lancome products, as there tends to be less of the specialized ingredients in the L'oreal products and that there tends to be some variation of other ingredients in the products.  An example of this is that in Lancome's Vissionaire serum, there is [4% of the LR2412 molecule](http://www.lancome-usa.com/Visionnaire/1000680,default,pd.html?start=1&q=visionnaire&cgid=skincare_visionnaire&cm_vc=search) while L'oreal's Youth Code Texture Perfector Serum Concentrate has [2% of the LR2412 molecule](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Skin-Care/Treatments/Youth-Code-Texture-Perfector-Serum-Concentrate.aspx).  So here is the list I have compiled up:\n\n**Eye Products:**\n\n* Absolue Eye Premium Bx is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Eye Cream\n* Rénergie is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Eye\n* High Résolution Eye Refill - 3X is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream\n\n\n**Treatments and Serums:**\n\n* Vissionaire is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Texture Perfector\n* Génefique Cream Serum (as serum) is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Serum Intense\n* Génefique Eye Light-Pearl is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Youth Regenerating Skincare Eye Cream\n\n**Moisturizers:**\n\n* Bienfait Aqua Vital Cream, Bienfait Aqua Vital Lotion, & Bienfait Multi-Vital Night is similar to L’oreal’s Ideal Moisture Even Skin Tone All Skin Types Day/Night Cream\n* High Résolution Refill - 3X is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream\n* Nutrix Royal & Nutrix is similar to L’oreal’s Hydra-Renewal Continuous Moisture Cream\n* Rénergie Cream is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Face, Neck & Chest\n* Rénergie Lift Multi-Action Night Cream & High Résolution Night Refill - 3X are similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle & Firming Night Cream\n* Génefique Repair Youth Activating Night Cream & Génefique Cream Serum (as moisturizer) is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Youth Regenerating Skincare Day/Night Cream\n\n**Makeup Removers/Cleanser:**\n\n* Effacil is similar to L’oreal’s Clean Artiste 100% Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover\n* Bifacil is similar to L’oreal’s Clean Artiste Waterproof & Long Wearing Eye Makeup Remover\n* Absolue Premium BX is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser\n* Lancome Eau Micellaire Douceur is similar to Skin Perfection 3 in 1 Purifying Micellar Solution (available in some non-U.S. markets).\n    * Lancome Eau Micellaire Douceur\n        \n        **aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Poloxamer 184,** Dihydrocholeth-30, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Benzyl Salicylate, Propylene Glycol, **Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Disodium EDTA,** Rosa Gallica Extract, Parfum.\n\n   * L'oreal Paris Skin Perfection 3 in 1 Purifying Micellar Solution\n\n        **aqua, hexylene glycol, glycerin, poloxamer 184, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, disodium EDTA,** polyaminopropyl biguanide.\n\n\nFor my sources to figure out L'oreal products that are similar to Lancome products, I use ingredient lists and product descriptions on L'oreal's website as well as Lancome's website.  If I could not find an ingredient list on either of those websites, I used Cosdna.  \n\nI hope this list was/is able to help some of you awesome people out.\n\nEDIT 1: added another product to the Makeup Removers/Cleanser section that nihilcupio gave in the comments.

    "body": "After starting [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/510zfo/should_we_be_using_low_ph_shampoo/) yesterday, I decided to put together a list featuring ABers' suggestions (from that post) and the results of my own research. Perhaps in due time we can have another spreadsheet as ppl begin pH testing their own products... but here's what I have for  now! (and ofc I'm happy to update this list w/ any comments that come into this post << I have not done this yet for this post, will update at end of day or so!!)      \n\nI'm lumping shampoos & body washes together b/c IMO surfactants are surfactants are surfactants so any body wash can be used on the hair and vice versa (and face, honestly, if the ingreds are gentle enough - but as it so happens, few of these are)   \n\n- don't laugh yall, but one of the lowest pH & lowest cost options out here is ~intimates~ body wash. our lady gardens have a low pH and so do the washes designed for that area.    \nSummer's Eve is quite inexpensive, you can get 45oz (15oz x3) for only $13 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=summer%27s+eve)! simple ingredients too: *Purified Water, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ammonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Fd&C Blue No. 1*. those who are prone to SD are advised to avoid SLES & SLS, but some can tolerate ALES, so I might try this for shampoo - why not?! my husband might be a little confused but whatevs #killinthegame     \n[and as for exactly what pH it is, website says: *Summer’s Eve’s pH-balanced products are formulated to be in harmony with the areas on which they are used. For topical application to the skin, they are formulated for a slightly acidic pH (about 5-6). For application to the vagina, they are formulated for mildly acidic pH (a pH of about 3.0-3.5).* I'm not certain which category washes fall under lol]\n\n- [Aqua Glycolic](http://www.aquaglycolic.com/product-aqua-glycolic-shampoo-body-cleanser) makes a pH 4.5 shampoo/body wash with 14% glycolic acid, retails ~$16/8 oz      \n\n- [Neutrogena T-Sal](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/t-sal-+therapeutic+shampoo+-+scalp+build-up+control.do?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PLA+-+Hair+-+SKU&utm_term=&utm_content=|mkwid|sQN6gfQPl_dc|pcrid|121181768720) has long been my go-to during SD flareups, a bit pricy to use regularly though (~$7/4.5 oz). it's 3% salicylic acid and I remember reading somewhere the pH is ~4.5     \n\n- everything from [Sebamed](https://www.sebamedusa.com/facial-cleanser#?offset=0&limit=24) is listed as pH 5.5, with the exception of a feminine care wash that's listed as 3.8 (I've seen it on some etailers but not on their official website, possibly DC'ed?) & a post-menopausal feminine care wash listed as 6.0; their shampoos and body washes aren't cheap tho. Cerave foaming is cheaper per oz <-- not sure how it would fare as a shampoo, but I bet Cerave would be a perfectly fine option for body wash!   \n\n- u/ms_moonlight recommends shampoos from \"*Keracare. It's marketed towards black women, but anyone can use it.*\" this makes sense, as relaxers are often super basic, so acidic shampoos are very important. after researching this brand a bit, I can confirm that all of their shampoos & conditioners list their pH on the front! I've seen anything from [4.5](https://www.amazon.com/AVLON-Keracare-Lather-Shampoo-Ounce/dp/B0054Y1KO2/ref=sr_1_10_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1473012244&sr=8-10&keywords=keracare+shampoo)-6 (and even lower for their conditioners). sells for about $10/8 oz (but you can find cheaper) to under $20/1L, easily available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=keracare+shampoo)!\n\n- Many salon/higher end brands are labeled with pH 4.5-5.5; of these, Joico can often be obtained relatively inexpensively at $20-30 for 1L, but u/oliviart123 cautions: *NEVER buy (american) professional salon brands anywhere OTHER than a licenced salon. It is illegal for someone to sell them on amazon/ebay and at drugstores like target/walgreens/walmart, even costco. Theres a huge black market for counterfeit salon products which is why you \"see\" them everywhere. No salon brand actually sells on amazon and most of the bottles will say its only gaurenteed to be legit IF purchased from a licensed salon.*   \nrelated, I know [Sally Beauty](http://www.sallybeauty.com/shampoo/Hair01,default,sc.html#~EDGE~!sort.axis__default~~!page.size__48~~page.number__1~~!curated.hair_solutions__Color%20Protect!~EDGE~) tends to have a lot of pro-quality stuff at pleb prices, so I'd be interested to see if any of their shampoos list pH's   \nalso, I believe Nexxus Therappe is also in the correct range\n\n- u/julietpae suggests [Malibu C](https://www.malibuc.com/catalog/cn/60/shampoos) shampoos *Malibu products are designed from a Vitamin C/ascorbic acid complex that is proven to stop and prevent oxidizers from effecting your hair. Most of all their products are vegan/gluten/sulfate/paraben and fragrance free* I haven't been able to confirm their pH anywhere, but maybe it's listed on the bottle?    \n\n- lastly, not surfactants, but u/im_twelve_ and u/thee_zohan both recommend the Herbal Essences cleansing conditioners. u/okayzac adds: it's good to use something purifying still once in awhile. Things like cleansing conditioners that do not provide any surfactant cleanse can potentially lead to hair loss (i.e Wen is being sued over this) we can build up the hormone DHT which when we reach too high of levels can lead to hair loss.   \n\n    FYI: any \"no more tears\" baby shampoo probably has pH ~7\n\n\n**Asian/international products**   \n\n- Lador acid shampoo: pH 4.5, $8/150ml from [Memebox](https://us.memebox.com/damage-protector-acid-shampoo?pdref=category)   \n\n- u/noys has pH tested Ryoe damage care shampoo as 5.5, kracie moisturizing shampoo 5.5-6. u/okayzac lists the Ryoe anti-aging shampoo as HG (not pH tested, but hopefully similar!)  \n\n- u/marybanana says the Ka'fen acid shampoo series (marketed towards color protection) from Taiwan lists *shampoo is 5.4, and the conditioner is 4.0. It's been two weeks, and my scalp has shown distinct improvement* but hasn't found a good ordering source yet  \n\n- u/xomandark *Whamisa has a line of shampoo (one for oily scalp, one for dry scalp) and they are both pH 4.5. I used the dry version for quite some time and it was pretty soothing to my easily irritated scalp. They also have a scalp tonic which is THE BEST at calming irritation* ordered from testerkorea   \n\n- breathlessly waiting for the exact brand name from u/neko-miko *Since I started Keratin treatments, I had to stop using shampoo with sulphates and sodium chloride.\nAfter searching for a while (and using the Sebamed shampoo which was fine and also cheaper in Germany), I now use a super cheap low-ph shampoo / shower gel combo made for kids which fulfills all my requirements and costs less than 1€.\nI haven't had any scalp problems since.*   \n\n- Eucerin makes a [pH 5 shampoo](http://int.eucerin.com/products/dermocapillaire/ph5-mild-shampoo) but it doesn't seem very easy to order (or at least, I'm not nearly as savvy with sources for ordering from Europe as from Asia haha)    \n\n\nIf you google around, pplz on the Internet have also done some pH testing, e.g. [here](http://www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com/2012/02/ph-of-shampoo-ultimate-list.html), [here](http://forums.longhaircommunity.com/showthread.php?t=90642), [here](http://acovant.com/shampoo.html)",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured.

So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you!

I don't really know what I'm paying extra for.\n\n\nThis new shampoo touts a gentle formula with \"no sulfates, no parabens, no dyes, no mineral oil and no silicones; great for all hair types\" but I am not well versed in ingredients for what makes a good or bad shampoo. Can anyone help me out ?\n\nIngredients list: \nWater/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Fragrance/Parfum, Panthenol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-10, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Salicylic Acid, Polyquaternium-7, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Glycolic Acid, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/Pantene-Sulfate-free-Soothing-Moisture-Shampoo/dp/B07KKYXZZZ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1548438272&sr=8-2&keywords=pantene+rose+water\n\n\n",

The few ingredients that are helpful are so far down the ingredients list that they're essentially useless for anything other than being able to use buzzwords in advertisements. This will clean your hair, probably pretty thoroughly considering most of these ingredients are surfactants. This will not hydrate, strengthen, soften, smooth, volumize or otherwise change your hair in any way. It might fade hair color.\n\nIn general, the ingredients to look for and ingredients to avoid vary a lot based on your hair and what you would like your hair to act like. If your only goal is \"remove dirt, oil, and other gunk from my hair\", this will do that.",

    "body": "Hello! So I've recently fallen in love with swimming as an exercise mainstay, and as a result ,my hair is suffering greatly. I've been taking all the easy precautions like wetting my hair with clean water before getting in the pool and wearing a swim cap, but now I'm looking to specific products that help with removing buildup from chlorine and other pool chemicals. In my research, the only ingredients I've found that are good for this purpose and commonly found in clarifying shampoos and some conditioners are:\n\n* Sodium Thiosulfate ([neutralizes chlorine](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n* Disodium/Tetrasodium EDTA ([chelating agent](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n\nWhich brings me to my question, which is a little silly and neurotic, but I hope someone can help me. I've really fallen in love with this [L'Oreal Kids 2-in-1 Swim Shampoo](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/hair-care/products/shampoo/loreal-kids-extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo.aspx?shade=extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo). I just love how it smells, I love the bottle, I love how cheap it is, and I love how it reminds me of when I was a kid! Upon looking into the ingredients though, I found neither Sodium Thiosulfate nor EDTAs among them. Here they are listed out:\n\n>AQUA/WATER/EAU • SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE • DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE • PEG-200 HYDROGENATED GLYCERYL PALMATE • POLYSORBATE 20 • SODIUM CHLORIDE • PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE • HEXYLENE GLYCOL • DISODIUM RICINOLEAMIDO MEA-SULFOSUCCINATE • PARFUM/FRAGRANCE • SODIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • POLYQUATERNIUM-10 • SODIUM METHYLPARABEN • MAGNESIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • MAGNESIUM LAURETH SULFATE • SODIUM OLETH SULFATE • DMDM HYDANTOIN • MAGNESIUM OLETH SULFATE • CI 47005 / YELLOW 10 • CI 14700 / RED 4\n\nBasically I want to know, am I missing something? How can L'Oreal confidently claim that this shampoo \"removes chlorine\" if there are no ingredients that are specifically capable of that? I like this product a lot and want to continue using it but I also want to make sure I'm getting all the pool chemicals out of my hair after I swim.\n\n^(In before \"just use it if you like it,\" I know my question is kinda silly, I just want to understand how these ingredients work!)",

Ps I’m writing on my phone so pardon the formatting. \n\nIngredients: \n\nWater, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Protease, Leucine, Alanine, Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Proline, Valine, Isoleucine, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Histidine, Cysteine, Methionine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Benzoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate\n\nReview:\nThis cleanser is a gel cleanser that gently foams when you add in some water and rub your hands together. It doesn’t have any added fragrances but it isn’t scent free either. There’s the smell of coconut, probably due to surfactants. Idk. A soapy coconut smell haha. \n\nHeres the routine I used:\nAM - wash with water -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser -> sunscreen\nPM - rovectin cleanser -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser \n\nVery simple I know. I’m still trying to fix my skin barrier so bear with me here. When applying it, it doesn’t feel so thick on my face. It foams a little so it doesn’t exactly fluff up too much. The cleanser didn’t feel stripping either. My face felt really soft afterwards. \n\nOther experiences:\nNow, I guess here’s where the good part ends. Let’s say that this cleanser brought waves of emotions and struggles right from the start. \n\nThe next day after first trying it, I woke up with a pimple along my eyebrow. There were also 2-3 CCs forming along my cheek. “okay that seems sus” I thought but shrugged it off and went about my day. \n\nThen over the next 2-3 days, my face texture got worse and my face started to become itchy. The tiny CCs became itchy. I decided to take a break from doing any skincare to let my face heal for a day. Afterwards I incorporated my moisturiser and slowly, the cleanser again. \n\nThings were okay for a day or 2. My face didn’t become too itchy but the CCs were still there. I thought things were finally turning good. Maybe I’ll finally be able to enjoy this cleanser!\n\nUnfortunately my body said no u and I started to get mini hives on my arms and legs every single day. Mind you, I’m already prone to hives due to my anxiety and occasionally sweat. But I’ve never gotten them every day. At first I brushed it off as anxiety and stress. But it got worse and worse each day. I ended up taking Zyrtec in hopes to keep it at bay. \n\nI came across a post on Instagram from this skincare influencer and it was on the cleanser. Apparently she ended up breaking out from the cleanser and experienced itchiness on her face after using the lotion as well. I traced back my memory and realised things got worse when I used the cleanser again. So I decided to stop using it. And as I thought, I wasn’t experiencing hives as much as before. \n\nIt’s kind of unfortunate really, I genuinely wanted to like this product. Everyone was raving about it. But whatever it was in it, my skin just couldn’t handle it. I’ve only truly used it for about over a week, excluding the break I took midway. If I could do this whole thing again, I wish I’d stopped the day when I experienced that reaction. When I had a sudden breakout right after using it. Oh well.\n\nVerdict: \nI’d give this product a 4/10. WNRP. It just didn’t work for me and my skin. And it is what it is . I’m now trying out the dokdo cleanser so we’ll see how things go. \n\nThanks for reading this. Have a good day!",

    "body": "• There aren’t that many reviews of products by Bonajour online so I decided to make a review post. All of the products were purchased from Amazon through the official Bonajour seller. \n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\n1.) Coconut Oil Body Moisturizer (300 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Olivate, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Saussurea Involucrata Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Olivoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Glyceryl Oleate, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Arginine, Carbomer, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n- Review: I’ve repurchased this body lotion multiple times already. The scent is so heavenly and it feels so good on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight but moisturizing. 5/5\n\n2.) Sensitive Skin Body Wash (500 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Disodium cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Propanediol, Sodium cocoyl glutamate, Sodium chloride, Glycerin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aniba Rosodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Octyldodecanol, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene glycol\n\n- Review: I love this body wash, I’ve purchased it 2 times and it lasts for a while too (even with daily use). It has a relaxing smell and it lathers well. I put this body wash on a Salux washcloth and the body wash doesn’t dry out my skin. 5/5\n\n3.) Mugwort Cream Calming Mask (1.9 fl. oz)\n\n- Ingredients: Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract(32.20%), Water, Kaolin, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bentonite, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery)Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Brassica Rapa (Turnip) Leaf Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Brassica OleraceaItalica (Broccoli) Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pusatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Citrusparadisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Octyldodecanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Oleanolic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (4,000ppm), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil(500ppm), Sod\n\n- Review: I’m still going through my first purchase of this and it’s grown on me. Although I prefer the I’m From Mugwort Mask, this mask is skin calming too. I use mask this during my menstruation cycle (where my skin is more prone to having skin inflammation) and it felt very nice. I also like how the date when opened can be written on the product + it’s a cheaper mugwort product. 4/5\n\n4.) Propolis Serum (100 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Propolis Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Ulmus Campestris (Elm) Bark Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Gleditsia Australis Thorn Extract, Angelica Dahurica Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Bletilla Striata Root Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Extract, Trichosanthes Kirilowii Root Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Amomum Xanthioides Seed Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Sodium Carbomer, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Epigallocatechin Gallate\n\n- Review: I have mixed thoughts about this product. The price is really good especially for the size (100 ML). I would recommend this serum for oily skin types. This is more of a skin calming serum rather than a hydrating one. It did calm my face but did little for my acne. This product is also unscented. I didn’t repurchase the serum. 3/5 \n\n5.) Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

    "body": "Does anyone know of a good conditioner with water-soluble silicones? For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have a lot of problems with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

You might want to find a protein free conditioner to use and only use the protein one once every couple of weeks.\n\nAlso salt spray will just dry out your strands and make your hair feel coarse. I'm not sure why you are using salt spray if your straighten your hair. It's more likely to make it wavy and crazy.\n\nIf you use heat I'd maybe get a silicone heat spray/serum and just use it on the parts you straighten. Silicone WILL wash out if you don't use it in every single product and it will help to protect your hair from heat.\n\nWhen not using heat. Use an oil on your ends to keep them soft.\n\nHope that helps :)",

    "body": "TL;DR Foaming cleanser with Coco-Glucoside was too stripping. Started experimenting with the emulsion-cream formula (Sodium Polyacrylate, oils, Glycerin, surfactants/solubilizers) – better but still too strong. Got some random papules. Need help with a cleansing formula to make it less stripping but without residue that might contribute to acne. A simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe left a residue, got some papules and one nodule because of it.\n\nDetailed version:\n\nSince simple foaming cleanser with just 2.7% Coco-Glucoside (and less=no foam) was too stripping to my combo (oily-normal-dry) skin I started experimenting with non-foaming emulsion-cream formula.\n\nI used Sodium Polyacrylate (Cosmedia SP) as an emulsifier and thickener. 1-2%, then found that 2 was too much.\n\nI used some surfactants/solubilizers with it, usually Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate at 0.5-5%. 2-5% was too strong. Every time I tried to add Coco-Glucoside (with an additional thickener, like Xanthan Gum), it was too strong, usually, 4 uses and my skin was crying for help. Even with oils, which I describe below.\n\nThen I added some oils, usually caprylic/capric triglyceride or grapeseed oil. 2-5%. Anything below 5% was too strong. I wonder, maybe Cosmedia is just too good at emulsifying sebum on the face. I still want to use it because it feels great at distributing it on a wet face and it's easy to rinse off.\n\nSo it mostly looked something like this:\n\n* 4-5% Oils\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 0.5-2% Surfactants/solubilizers\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* Lactic acid to pH about 6.\n* Then I tried something simple like:\n* 4% Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n\nIt was still a little too strong, but sebum production lowered and my skin calmed down a little.\n\nNext, I tried something like this:\n\n* 2% Grapeseed oil\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 1.1% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 0.85% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 0.5% Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate\n\nToo strong. Added more oils to 5% total. It's better, but my dry areas are still tight (cheeks) and normal areas a little tight. And now I have a problem with 2-5 papules on oily areas (forehead).\n\nSo I'm not sure what could I change and what's causing inflamed pimples – maybe it's still too stripping or it's because of some PEG-7 residue? I read that it's a surfactant AND a refatener.\n\nSpeaking of residues – I tried to make a simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe:\n\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% BTMS-50\n* 2% Cetyl Alcohol\n* 0.5% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* 0.5% Glyceryl Stearate Citrate\n* 0.5% Hydroxyethylcellulose\n\nI used it like 4 times and didn't like it as it left a powdery residue (I think it's a BTMS and/or Cetyl Alcohol?) and I got some papules and one nodule. It was 16 days ago. I read that BTMS can break some people out badly, I wonder if maybe these papules that I've been getting lately was still because of a cleanser with BTMS that I used 4 times 2 weeks ago.\n\nI know it's not a place for acne, but I think it was important to mention it. I think most of my acne is because of just using too stripping cleansers and/or a residue of product.\n\nI am open to suggestions, I can replace Sodium Polyacrylate with something else, but it's hard to get some emulsifiers/solubilizers here in Poland so I'd like to use it.\n\nI use a simple cream after cleansing:\n\n* 5% Dimethicone 350 CST\n* 4% Betaine\n* 2% Sodium Polyacrylate - I think I'll lower it to 1-1.5% because it's a little too thick and it dries too quickly. Or maybe add something like Sorbitol?\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n\nHere's a list of emulsifiers/surfactants/solubilizers (except ingredients which I described above) which I can buy here I Poland:\n\n* Olivem 1000 - I'm afraid a little that it'll contribute to acne, even in a rinse-off product.\n* Creamy Base 1-1-3 *(Aqua, Glycerin, Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Trilaureth-4 phosphate, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin)*\n* Self-emulsifying creamy base *(Glyceryl Stearate Citrate (and) Sucrose Stearate (and) Sucrose Distearate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate (and) Cetyl Alcohol (and) Sodium Ricinoleate)* \\- it contains Fatty Alcohol and I'm not sure if it contributed to acne or it was just BTMS.\n* Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate - the description says it needs to have 15-40% of oils to be stable, so I think it's not a good idea for a cleansing formula.\n* Glyceryl Monostearate - it needs to have pH >6.8\n* SLP *(Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate)*\n* Polysorbate 20, 80, 85\n* *Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate* \\- Again, Fatty Alcohol\n* Simulgel Thickener (Sodium Acrylate / Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer & Isohexadecane & Polysorbate 80) - maybe it would be a better option than just Sodium Polyacrylate\n   * Or this: Emulcold Extra (Sodium Acrylate; Acryloyldimethyl Taurate; Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer; Isohexadecane; Polysorbate 60)\n* Polawax (Emulsifying Wax NF)\n* Gosulin IL *(Isoamyl Laurate & Isoamyl Cocoate) -* not an emulsifier, but I read it can be used to wash off dimethicone easily.\n* Carbomer - I think it can't be used alone to emulsify, but it works well with Sodium Polyacrylamide, so I can use less Cosmedia and lower pH >6 without loss of a viscosity \n* Surfactants:\n   * Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (O110) - I read that it's harsher than Coco-Glucoside.\n   * Decyl Glucoside (O10) - same concerns as above.\n   * Lauryl Glucoside\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids - it's a new ingredient in a shop, I haven't made a research about it yet.\n   * Cocamidopropyl Betaine - I think I'm allergic to amphoteric surfactants or it's because of some of it binds to the skin? My skin is itchy after I use it a couple of days in a row.\n   * Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate - same as above.\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate - a product with it made my hands very dry, so I think I don't want to use it on my face. Which is sad because studies have shown that it's one of the mildest anionics...",

It doesn’t foam. I just gently massage the gel around my face. It’s enough to get my pores clear. Doesn’t leave any residue. \n\nIf you needed it a bit stronger you could try 5% sodium cococyl glycinate (that’s calculating for a product with 25% active surfactant matter). \n\nAnother thing-  if you want to try a different oil in your formulas, you could try Neossance Squalane (from sugar cane). It is non-irritating and non-acnegenic. Doesn’t have any astringent qualities. Very lightweight but conditioning oil.",

I started by trying to make a bare-bones dupe of my current favorite cleanser, [Donginbi Red Ginseng Treatment Oil Gel Cleanser](http://www.kgcus.com/Red-Ginseng-Moisturizing-Cleansing-Oil-Gel.html).\n\nIt's a transparent, syrup-viscosity gel cleanser that maintains its lubricating properties even when applied to wet skin, which I've found is kind of unusual for gel cleansers - they tend to disappear into my wet skin. It rinses completely without leaving film or residue, and I feel legit clean afterwards (again, kind of unusual for a non-foaming cleanser).\n\nI noticed that the top ingredient was Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters, a water-soluble ester of olive oil that functions as an emollient and mild co-emulsifier/surfactant. It's also known as [Olivem 300](http://www.lotioncrafter.com/olivem-300.html).\n\nAccording to Lotioncrafter, you can use it up to 84%, so it can function as the base of a gentle, non-foaming cleanser. Right now, I'm playing with a recipe like this:\n\n* 40% Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters\n\n* 40% distilled water (this could also be a hydrosol, aloe juice, etc.)\n\n* 7% disodium cocoamphodiacetate (a super mild surfactant, to make sure my cleanser actually cleans - you can replace this with any surfactant you want)\n\n* 4% emulsifier (I'm using Olivem 800 because it seems to work well with Olivem 300)\n\n* 0.5% Liquid Germall Plus to preserve (or your favorite preservative)\n\n* The remainder as fun stuff for your skin type - I like soothing/emollient/film-forming products: hydrolized proteins, panthenol, allantoin, botanical extracts, fatty alcohols, glycerin, hyaluronic acid are some ideas\n\nI put it all together in a beaker (minus the preservative and any other heat-sensitive ingredients you might add) and heat it in a water bath to about 80C, stirring regularly until the Olivem 800 has completely melted or it's been 20 minutes, whichever comes last. I keep stirring sporadically as it cools, then add preservative and give it a last stir.\n\nI am LOVING it. My recipe ends up around pH 5.5, perfect for our low-pH-loving acid mantles. It's a thick, runny-gel type texture, it gets me clean and rinses completely. It doesn't dry my skin out in the slightest, which is SUPER rare for me.\n\nTL;DR: Dry or sensitive skin? Want to make a gentle, non-foaming cleanser? Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters makes a great cleanser base.",

    "body": "To preface, I have dry skin and had heard good things about the Missha cleansing milk (this is not that product). I picked up this cleanser (around $10-11, on sale) because I couldn't find the cleansing milk at my local Missha store. Apparently they had run out so I decided to try my luck at what I hoped to be a similar product. I did look up the ingredients before buying since my skin is susceptible to a burning sensation when it doesn't like things. \n\nHere is the list: \nWater, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Nymphaea Coerulea Flower Extract, Lauramide DEA, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Acrylate Coploymer, Polyquaternium-7, Capylyl Glycol, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-90M, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Buthoxy Diglycol, Glycereth-26, Diglycerin, Diethoxy Diglycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nSo I've been using this since December and am almost out. I used to only use this during the PM but started using this both morning and night to wash away the eye goo and stuff (lolew?). I normally lather it up before I apply it to my face. \n\nThe product does claim to be a one step type of product - the kind that can remove your make up. I didn't really use it this way so I'm unsure how well it functions as one. I will say that I did use it a few times to remove my every day make up but I don't wear a lot of makeup to begin with - mascara, light eyeshadow, bbcream and light blush at most (mascara always). However, it DID remove all of that makeup when I tried to use it as a one step. So for lazy, light make up days I think it works. Of course, it worked just fine as a second cleanser. \n\nThe cleanser didn't burn my skin while in use nor did it feel stripping or drying or tight when I finished cleansing. It didn't have that \"clean\" feeling that ordinary soaps give but it felt like my face...was my face, if that makes sense. It felt like the whole day had been washed away but all the natural oils hadn't. I didn't even feel the need to rush to put on my toner when I get out of the shower, which is where I cleanse my face. I'm unsure what the ph is though, unfortunately, so I apologize since many people look for that in reviews. \n\nThere is a fragrance that goes away after you wash. The strength was that of a normal shampoo, I think. However if you're super sensitive to fragrances, this may not be for you. \n\nAnyway, I think I'd rate this a 4/5 only because it's not an HG right now. I would definitely repurchase this, but I'm still experimenting with cleansers so I can't say it's HG status just yet. It does its job without making my skin cranky! I also like that it's available at my local store lol. \n\nTLDR: It's a foamy milk cleanser, does agree with my dry, sensitive, hates the world skin. Not super drying, not super stripping and would RP. PH level currently unknown. \n\n",

If you would like an introduction with some common definitions, please see [Cosmetic Chemistry 101](http://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyAddiction/comments/2a671y/cosmetic_chemistry_101/).  Please note that some parts of this are simplified for understanding. If you do not understand a part of this, please feel free to message me or comment about which part you do not understand.\n\n***\n\n###What are Surfactants?\n\nA surfactant is a material that greatly reduces the surface (or interfacial) tension of water at low concentrations.^[1][2]\n\n**How does that relate to anything?**\n\n1. Reducing the **surface** tension of water allows for water to spread easier (see [picture](http://commercial-cleaning-products.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Water-and-Surfactant.png)).\n\n2. Reducing the **interfacial** tension (*interfacial meaning between two faces*) between water and an oil/lipid allows them to mix where previously they can't. *[If you want to test this, get a cup and pour some water in, and then pour some oil (e.g. canola oil, olive oil, etc) in and watch how they interact. Try mixing them and seeing what happens.]* \n\n3. At a certain concentration of surfactant and solution (aka Critical Micelle Concentration),^[3] micelles form. \n\nThe combination of these three things is what helps wash away dirt and oil from your body. \n\nNow let's delve into some more details about surfactants.\n\n##What makes up a surfactant:\n\nA surfactant is composed of two parts, a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. (Remember hydrophilic = likes water so it is soluble, and hydrophobic = repels water). See illustration of this [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png/400px-TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png).\n\nThis can further be broken into four categories based on the charge of the head (nonionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric). I won't delve into detail about this yet.\n\nIt is highly important that there is a polar and an apolar part because this is the reason it is possible for surfactants to lower surface tension. The apolar part sticks out and becomes the surface, lowering the surface tension (superficial free energy). [This is a graph showing the surface tension of SDS solution.](http://i.imgur.com/fwPWwAv.png)^[4] The relevant curve is the one with diamonds (PVP=0g/L). The effect is seen at very low concentrations.\n\nSo that's how one part works. \n\n##Remember how I was talking about micelles before?\n\nThey're important now. Micelles are an aggregate of all the surfactant parts (all the head and tails are aligned) such that it makes a nice little circle like [so](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Micelle.png/220px-Micelle.png).\n\n*Note: this is for oil-in-water, for water-in-oil it is reversed where the tails are the outside and the heads are inside due to polarity. This comes to play for emulsions, where I will delve into this in more detail.\n\nSoap/shampoo is a surfactant because it forms water-soluble micelles that trap the otherwise insoluble dirt and oil particles illustrated [here](http://us.arcanatura.com/wp-content/uploads/whatisshampoo.png).\n\n##5 main Applications of surfactants\n1. Cleansing\n2. Emulsification\n3. Solubilization\n4. Conditioning\n5. Special effects\n\n\n##Common types of surfactants in cosmetic products\n* Acyl-amino acids & salts\n* Alkyl ether sulfates\n* Alkyl glyceride sulfates\n* Alkyl polyglucosides or glycerides\n* Alkyl sulfates\n* Alkyl sulfonates\n* Alkyl-aryl sulfonates\n* Amide ether sulfates\n* Betaines\n* Carboxylates\n* decyl glucoside\n* disodium cocoamphodiacetate\n* Ethanolamides or alkanolamides\n* Fatty acid isethionates\n* Phosphate esters\n* polyglucose/lactylate blend\n* Sulfates\n* Sulfoacetates\n* Sulfonates\n* Sulfosuccinates\n* Taurates or taurides\n\n\nNote, I will make a second part to this because it is getting long!\n\n\n***\n## Definitions\n* **Surfactant**: A material that greatly reduces the surface/interfacial tension of a liquid.\n* **Interfacial**: Between two faces (e.g. between two materials such as oil and water)\n* **Lipid**: Naturally occurring organic compounds that are related by their insolubility in water and solubility in organic solvents (benzene, chloroform, etc). ^[5] Examples include fats, steroids (cortisol, etc), fatty acids, and waxes.\n* **Micelle**: An aggregate of surfactants dispersed in a liquid. See picture [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Micelle_scheme-en.svg/532px-Micelle_scheme-en.svg.png).\n* **Nonionic**: Not ionic (for a detergent it won't dissolve into ions)\n* **Anionic**: Negatively charged ion\n* **Cationic**: Positively charged ion\n* **Amphoteric**: Have a polar and non-polar part\n\n\n\n\n***\nBibliography\n\n^[1] Wikipedia. *[Surfactants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant).*\n\n^[2] Kiwi Web, Chemistry and New Zealand. *[Surfactants.

But then I heard it contains surfactants and if you don't rinse it off, it will keep breaking down your natural oils. Specifically I already bought the Vichy micellar water, I'll just paste the ingredient list here if it helps.\n\nAqua/Water, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Poloxamer 184, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Parfum/Fragrance",

I used bioderma and unfortunately that one irritated me and caused acne even after rinsing off. I like the garnier brand. No issues here :) I leave it on. I use it a couple extra times at night to make sure everything is completely removed. But when I use a cleanser I’m wasting so much water and also making a mess from splashing my face. I think I prefer the micellar water instead, I feel and look clean. And I also don’t get dried out by it. Garnier also says you can leave it on. It all just depends on how your skin handles it though. I personally have extremely sensitive reactive skin. Still healing some acne spots from using cerave……….byw cerave causes pimples for me. I hope this info helps :) I was curious about if ppl rinse it off but after seeing so many ppl say to rinse micellar water off… if the bottle says no need to rinse, all you can do is see how your skin likes it. If not eh wash it after no big deal. :)",

The key is to just force yourself into not washing it and using your dry shampoo. I wore a lot of braids! Haha. It took my hair about a year to regulate out to where I didn't have to use dry shampoo at all on the second day. Batiste was my dry shampoo of choice because it's pretty cheap. I don't know why it took my hair so long to regulate out, but it did. Your second day hair is great for curls too, to that helps. Good luck!",

I read a lot of reviews from bloggers especially in Asia and almost all of them have recommended the products to their readers. I've been seeing photos of the Skin Detoxers all over my feed so I had to purchase them. And I am not disappointed! I got the set thanks to the promotion :D My favourite is the Green Tea variant which I use at night before bed and I like that it gently exfoliates my skin without drying it. My skin always feels hydrated after using. I've noticed that it helps to balance out my sebum production which my oily skin can appreciate very much. The Rose variant is really nice too and it's very refreshing to use in the morning. I'm really happy with my purchase I would definitely repurchase <3",

I was thinking of swapping it for the LRP Toleriane Cleanser when I finish it, or getting CeraVe. CeraVe is $13 dollars less here in Canada for the same amount of LRP.\n\nDo people have experience with either product? Is one a better dupe for the Schaf?",

Like I didn't think it was possible to look forward to a cleanser this much! Minimal ingredients, pH between 5 and 5.5, no fragrance but has a lovely clean scent, creamy gel texture that doesn't foam, rinses completely clean and leaves my skin soft and hydrated. It also has HA and ceramides but I don't think those stay on the skin long enough to do much. But I really recommend it to anyone with dry, dehydrated or sensitive skin!\n\nI don't know where LRP is sold in Canada, but in Europe most pharmacies carry it and you can usually get a free samples to try out, so that could be an option? If you do opt for the CeraVe, I've heard from quite a few people that it can leave a bit of a residue, so that's something to be aware of. Hope this helps!",

The CeraVe is okay if you can't find anything else, and between that and a fragranced cleanser I would always choose CeraVe, but LRP is better long term in my opinion.

    "body": "**Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser**\n\nIt’s finally time! I have been looking forward to sharing this review with you all for quite awhile. Let’s dive in…\n\nThis water based cleanser from Rovectin is one that I have had my eye on for some time. I’ve mentioned it before…but I love Eunice of Wishtrend/EuniUnni and her videos on YouTube. Pretty much anything she recommends I will give a try! She really loves Rovectin and this cleanser in particular…so I was happy to order it.\n\nLooking into the brand itself made me even more curious/excited about their products. Rovectin is a brand created out of the desire to help those undergoing cancer treatments address the dryness and skin barrier deterioration that can often come with that battle. The first product created was their Anti-Irritant Barrier Repair Ultra Cream…and from there the brand expanded to offer several different “ranges” of products. The overall theme to their products seems to be soothing, calming, and barrier repair. Only one product in their line is focused on exfoliation…and even then it uses a very small amount of LHA.\n\nI was particularly interested in getting my hands on a couple of the Rovectin products not only from Eunice’s recommendation…but also because I knew I would be venturing into the world of Curology/Tretinoin this year. As I’m sure many of you know…these stronger ingredients/products are known to cause irritation and dryness. While it depends on the person, the effects/adjustment period while on Tretinoin can be quite drastic. I decided that incorporating a couple Rovectin products into my routine a bit before starting Curology/Tretinoin would help prep my skin and help support my skin through this adjustment stage. \n\nThe packaging for the Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser is really straight forward and clean (which I love). The pump style bottle is made of a thicker plastic that could be reused which makes me wish Rovectin had refill sizes of this! Aside from that, things are just as straight forward inside the bottle.\n\nFeatured ingredients here include Centella Asiatica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Grape Seed Extract, and Fermented Radish Root Extract. Aside from those…the typical lineup of coconut based surfactants, stabilizers, pH balancers, and preservatives are included as well. The list of extract is fairly low compared to other water based cleansers I have used…and there is no added fragrance or essential oils to speak of. Really, a basic cleanser with no noticeable scent.\n\nApplication is exactly what you would expect from a gel style cleanser. Just about half of a pump is needed to get a really nice lather going (although not super dense/luxurious feeling) for the cleanse. From the first application I noticed a nice feeling of hydration and cooling while using this product. It’s the kind of cleanser that I don’t mind taking a bit of time with to gently massage and work it around. No stinging or harsh feeling here making me want to just rinse and go as quickly as possible. \n\nOnce rinsed, the Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser really impressed me with how well it seemed to cleanse my skin…without leaving me feeling dry or tight. Now, this is all relative to how my skin was adjusting to Tretinoin LOL! I was almost always feeling a little dry…and post cleansing was the time where it was most intense. But, I really think things could have been A LOT worse had I used a harsh/stripping cleanser. This product made me feel comfortable in taking just a bit of time to get dried off and start my routine vs. stumbling for my hydrating toner immediately. Especially now that my skin is more adjusted to Curology…I love the hydrated and “normalized” state this product leaves my skin in. \n\nAnytime I see “fancy” ingredients in an oil or water based cleanser (so 1st and 2nd step) I give some side eye. Products that are rinsed off so quickly haven’t ever lived up to their claims of brightening or anti-aging should they have them (at least for me). But, this Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser was something I was totally fine taking my time with (1-2 minutes)…and in that time I really feel that the various forms of Sodium Hyaluronate and Centella Asiatica were able to provide some mild but noticeable hydration and calming. \n\nOne month into using this product and I’m so glad I worked it into my routine while adjusting to Tretinoin. It wasn’t mind blowing…no incredible scent, miles long list of interesting extracts, or drastic benefit really. It just…worked. And it worked even in the face of some dry, flaky, and itchy skin without making things worse.\n\nThe Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser is one that I think all skin types would get along with. But those with sensitive skin or who are adjusting to a prescription skincare product may find some additional value here. A total win and one that I will repurchase should I experience more skin sensitivity in the future!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, decyl glucoside, glycerin, sodium chloride, citric acid, hyaluronic acid, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium hyaluronate, centella asiatica extract, propanediol, butylene glycol, hexylene glycol, disodium edta, glycine, 1,2-hexanediol, serine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, protease, leucine, alanine, lysine, arginine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, threonine, proline, valine, isoleucine, vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract, histidine, cysteine, methionine, ethylhexylglycerin, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, potassium benzoate, peg-120 methyl glucose trioleate\n\nWhere To Buy (Rovectin US Site $17.00 USD): [https://rovectin.com/collections/cleanser/products/conditioning-cleanser](https://rovectin.com/collections/cleanser/products/conditioning-cleanser)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj11lh6axb251.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c78273c3a6c10aa1d4e21ed5b81cea057eb75284",

    "body": "Hey all,\n\nI've been using [Nature's Gate Hemp Nourishing Shampoo for Dry Frizzy Hair](https://wholesale.frontiercoop.com/productdetail.html/nature-s-gate-hemp-nourishing-shampoo-for-dry-frizzy-hair18-fl-oz/209043) for about five years now. In that time I haven't had to buy more of it very often because I'd bought it in bulk. Now I'm getting low on my last bottle and go to search where to buy more, and turns out they went out of business a while ago and I hadn't noticed :/\n\nSo I'm looking for a replacement! My hair is:\n\n1.\tShort\n2.\tThin\n3.\tStraight\n4.\tNot very dense\n5.\tI just did the strand of hair in a cup of water test from the wiki, and it sank almost immediately, so I guess that means it's pretty porous\n6.\tPretty oily, so I shampoo every few days (schedule and sweat depending) and will usually cowash with [Kirkland Signature Moisture Conditioner](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-moisture-conditioner-33.8-fl-oz.product.100375352.html) in between\n\nI've used typical grocery store shampoos (Old Spice, Axe, Dove for Men, Head & Shoulders, etc.) in the past and a lot of them have been too harsh, making my hair really frizzy and drying out my scalp, kicking oil production into overdrive, which is something I'd definitely like to avoid. I figure something with similar ingredients, or ingredients that do the same thing would be best, but I have no idea where to look. They are:\n\n>Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Glycerin, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Ruscus Aculeatus (Butcher’s Broom) Root Extract, Pimenta Dioica (Allspice) Fruit Extract, Pilocarpus Pennatifolius (Jaborandi) Leaf Extract, Silybum Marianum (Milk Thistle) Seed Extract, Sambucus Nigra (Elder) Flower Extract, Chrysanthemum Sinense Flower Extract, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Polysorbate 20, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Phthalate free), Caramel\n\nThis list is what I see on my bottle. They must've reformulated at some point before going under because it's different from what's listed in the link.\n\nSo yeah, that's where I'm at right now. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

So the first version should be much more harsh on the skin.\n\n\nYou know what the second ingridient list reminds me of? Do not judge, please.

decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, there are many companies for example, The Ordinary that are making great products that are inexpensive. \n\nYour lucky you don’t really have acne prone skin so here’s the routine I’d recommend to you for blackhead:\n\nAM:\nGentle cleanser - I’d recommend CeraVe ($10.98)  \n\n\nSerum/Acids: For blackheads Id recommend - The Ordinary Niacinimide 10% + zinc 1% as its gentle and is known to un-clog pores. Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

If none of them cause breakouts, you can just alternate which one you use)   \n\n- e.l.f. daily face cleanser w/ purified water\n- philosophy purity made simple (this one is moisturizing)\n- fresh soy face cleanser (this one is mild and a good one to start with)\n\n**Deep Cleanser** (I would probably only use this 1-2 a week in place of your regular cleanser because they seem more harsh on your skin. I would wait to start these after you get used to a daily cleanser)  \n\n- pacifica kale detox deep cleaning face wash\n- purity the microdelivery exfoliating facial wash\n\n**Serum**\n\n- caudalie vinoperfect radiance serum \n\n**Moisturizers** (Pick one and use it morning and night) \n\n- pacifica dreamy youth day and night face cream\n- philosophy renewed hope in a jar (this one has great reviews, maybe start here)\n- caudalie vinosource moisturizing sorbet \n\n**Occlusive** (use this at night for dehydrated skin, damaged moisture barrier)  \n\n- Vaseline (You might already had this at home so you don't have to buy more things)\n- Facial oil (if you have olive oil, sunflower seed, argan oil, jojoba oil, etc, it might be a good place to start.) \n\n**DIY Masks** (You can make nice masks with stuff you might already have at home)  \n\n- Ground up oatmeal + honey + yogurt/milk. This makes my skin really moisturized and glowy. \n- plain yogurt or milk makes my skin look brighter and less dull\n- honey + green tea leaves\n- Turmeric powder. Add this to any of the above masks for a nice glow to your skin. (Skip if you're very pale because it might be too yellow) \n\n**Products to Try in the future**\n\n- Stridex pads in red box. It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun. You're young, but sun damage can really exacerbate all skincare issues down the road.",

I also took them right when I woke up so excuse any less than stellar focusing/editing.\n\n[Bottles bottles bottles!](http://imageshack.com/a/img910/4102/mVzP1C.jpg) ~**~ [Masks!](http://imageshack.com/a/img901/9827/B78rFB.jpg) ~**~ [Skylake Bae Sample Heaven cont.](http://imageshack.com/a/img661/2466/UkDTBZ.jpg)\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe second I saw Skylake opened their English webshop, I hit that place up like a frenzied vulture.  I basically became obsessed after the Mishibox shampoo sample, because I've never had a shampoo work so perfectly for my hair (long, oily scalp) - and I've tried nearly every store brand Target carries, salon brands, organic brands, sulfate frees, etc.  I ran out and was unhappily using Biosilk until my fresh bottle arrived, and lord am I relieved.  \n\nI bought the shampoo, a box of their Elastic/Pore sheet masks, 1 ea. of their Brightening and Relaxing/Trouble Care masks, and a mini Oriental Herbal Relax Toner.  The rest is all samples from the gracious Skylake gods above, they did not mess around for their opening event.  I somehow managed to miss the face powder priceline by like 3 dollars since I didn't pay attention, but I received one anyway!  The best pity.  Samples include:\n\nOriental Herb Hosu Aqua Gel, Oriental Herb Hosu Aqua Skin, Elastic/Brightening soap, Natural Foam Cleanser, Refresh Cleansing & Massage Cream, Oriental Herb Natural Sun Screen SPF50 PA+++, Oriental Herb Lotion & Cream, Green Energy Essence, Natural Multi Blemish Balm SPF36 PA++\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSo, naturally, I tried some of the samples and the face powder the other day/last night.  My face lately looks like I'm peeling from the devil's sunburn because of tretinoin, no amount of moisturizing layers have been helping me during the day or night, so I honestly figured \"WHAT ELSE COULD GO WRONG\" and just dove right in.  Idiot girl continues to not patch test mass amounts of items, what happens next will shock you.\n\n*My face this morning was actually not bad*.  Consider me hella pleased to see my flaking was minimal, and I actually still looked moisturized to an extent.  If this is just a fluke, I'm still okay with it.  If this is the power of those Hosu samples, I am going to need full sizes.  And on that note, some impressions for items!\n\n------------------------\n\n**ORIENTAL HERB CLEANSING POWDER (blue)**\n\n*cnidium officinale root powder, glutinous rice powder, sodium carbonate, phaseolus angularis seed powder, phaseolus radiatus seed powder, sodium laurate, sodium stearate, sodium myristrate, sodium palmate*\n\nThis powder when mixed with water, for me, tested at a pH of 7.  I tested it a couple of times to be sure, but it definitely reads differently than my DHC powder, so I'm confident that is accurate enough.  However, last night I threw all caution to the tretinoin wind and used it anyway - it's not bad!  It doesn't feel like your skin is taut and dry after, but extended use will need to be tested.\n\nIn the bottle, it smells like an earthy green tea, and it looks like it too.  When in use though, it smells like some baked you a fresh stack of waffles and then went, \"you know what would be delicious on this? Mushrooms.\"  Surprisingly, it is not a bad combo.  In fact, I would rank it as one of my favorite product smells in a while.  The powder is slightly gritty and doesn't entirely dissolve, but it's not scratchy.\n\n~~\n**HERBAL COOL SHAMPOO**\n\n*SKYLAKE oriental herb water (water, angelica gigas extract, peppermint leaf extract, artemisia absinthum extract, morus alba leaf extract,cnidium officinale root extract, licorice root extract, morus alba barf extract, angelica dahurica root extract, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, inula helenium extract, laminaria japonica extract, phellodendron amurense bark extract, clove flower extract), disodium cocoamphodiacetate, cocamidopropyl betaine, tea-cocoyl glutamate, disodiumlaureth sulfosuccinate, glycerin, cocamidedea, peg-12 dimethicone, amodimethicone, polygonatum multiflorum, polyqua ternium-7, scutellaria baicalensis root powder, polyquatemlum-10, peppermint leaf oil, menthol, phellodendron ammurense bark, allantoin, panthenol, caprylhydroxamic acid / caprylyl glycol / glycerin, salicylic acid, citric acid, disodium edta, rhizome/root*\n\nI just really love this shampoo and have a lot of feelings about it.\n\n~~\n**ORIENTAL HERB HOSU AQUA SKIN & GEL**\n\nThe skin is super watery and pours out of the sample bottle like the wind, so be careful.  The gel is thin and refreshing.  Both have this smell that is so familiar, but I can't put my finger on it.  It's not a disagreeable smell and it dissipates fairly quickly.  I am super duper impressed by the moisture I got from these samples, and they are both lightweight and breathable.  This seem like ideal items for hot and humid climates, and rough summers.\n\n~~\n**ELASTIC/PORE MASK SHEETS**\n\n*SKYLAKE oriental herb water (water, angelica gigas extract, peppermint leaf extract, artemisia absinthum extract, morus alba leaf extract,cnidium officinale root extract, licorice root extract, morus alba barf extract, angelica dahurica root extract, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, inula helenium extract, laminaria japonica extract, phellodendron amurense bark extract, clove flower extract), carbomer 981, sodium polyacrylate, disodium edta, allantoin, glycerin, propylene glycol, hmamelis virgiana (witch hazel) water, 1.3bg, polysorbate 80, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, paeonia suffruticosa root extract, glycerin, butylene glycol, betaine, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, sodium pca, triethanolamine, sodium hyaluronate 1%, natto gum, collagen, portulaca oleracea extract, aloe barbadensis leaf extract*\n\nI haven't tried one yet, but I figured some people might want the ingredients.  I am going to slap one on my face before work though.\n\n~~\n**Oriental Herb Relax Toner**\n\nThis stuff smells like acidy dirt, I don't even know what to tell you.  It's kind of bizarre.  It's wet. I will probably still use it on my face because it's pocket convenient.",

All the products I use and review here are completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus, etc ). So here we go: \n\n**BEST**: \n\n1. **Acne.org cleanser**: this is my HG face cleanser that I have repurchased so many times. No matter how many products I try over the years, I always come back to this because it’s cost effective, works well without drying out my skin, and does not leave a residue behind. It has a gel texture and come in a pump bottle which make it super convenient to use. \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Disodium Cocamphodiacetate, Butylene Glycol, Sage Extract, Cucumber Extract, White Oak Bark Extract, Panthenol, Allantoin, Acrylates Copolymer, Methylgluceth-20, Polysorbate-20, Quaternium-15, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Face Cleanser:** This cleanser is one of my recent discovery and I like it a lot. It’s a little more pricey than the [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) cleanser, but it works well and is gentle on the skin. It comes in a tube which makes it convenient for travel. \n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Coconut Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Stearyl Alcohol, Allantoin,  Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium PCA, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Maltodextrin,  Tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Soon Jung pH 5.5 Foam Cleanser:** This is a Korean product. It comes in a tube and does cleanse well, doesn’t over dry, and leaves no residue behind. Overall, this is a good cleanser. If you are looking for a good Korean water based cleanser, I would recommend this one. This would be best for people with normal to oily skin, IMO.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Coco -betaine, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Madecassoside\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WORST**: \n\n1. **Hada Labo Goku-jyun Foaming Face Wash:** This is probably the worse cleanser out of everything I tried in a long time. I decided to purchase this product to try because I like the oil cleanser from Hada Labo, but this one is a total let down! This cleanser come in a pump bottle, which makes it easy to dispense the product, but that’s the only pro. Now the cons: This foam cleanser does not cleanse well. For me, It’s too gentle on the skin, leave a greasy residue on my skin and made me break out. I believe the greasy feeling is due to the Vaseline in the formula. I think this cleanser will only work for people with dry to very dry skin, but even if you have dry skin, there are so many other better cleansers out there. Those of you with oily, acne-prone or combo skin, this product will be a disaster! So stay away!\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, BG, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, PEG-8, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium Taurine Cocoyl Methyltaurate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate(Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), **Vaseline**, Citric Acid, Polyquaternium-7, EDTA-2Na, BHT, Methylparaben\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SO-SO:**\n\n1. **Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser:** This is another Korean product. It comes in a pump bottle and is very convenient to use. However, this is a very average cleanser. It’s not the worst, but not the best either. It works and is gentle on the skin, but there’s nothing wow worthy about it. Also, there’s nothing it does that the other cleansers I mention above cannot do. I won’t be repurchasing this one. \n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola) Extract, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Protease, Leucine, Alanine, Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Proline, Valine, Isoleucine, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Histidine, Cysteine, Methionine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Benzoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate",

For drier and dehydrated skin that isn't acne prone, you could use this as a single cleanse. I have all winter. \n\n* **Clinique Take The Day Off Balm** - I got this as a sample pot and it's really cosmetically elegant. Lathers up beautifully. Very satisfying to use. Single cleanse works for me. \n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Radiance cleansing balm** - this is so fancy! Unlike the Clinique, it turns straight to an oil texture when you rub it in. I prefer that the Clinique is a slightly thicker texture when you rub it in personally but I'm trying a fermented skincare routine which is why I bought it. The packaging is amazing - it comes with a spatula in a little compartment in the lid! I'm not sure it emulsifies as well as the Clinique so I double cleanse my T-zone to be safe. \n\n* **Simple Refreshing Gel face wash** - very nice, good second cleanser. Cheap but effective. Also Fungal Acne safe according Folliculitis Scout but please check yourself. I use this as my second cleanser on my T-zone and my sole cleanser on my neck/upper chest.",

The obvious answer should be the hyped Prequel Gleanser, but Ulta has the travel size 3.4 oz of the Naturium Glow Getter Multi-Oil Body Wash (last pic) for $4.99, and the size and price is appealing to me. \n\nI’m looking into things, and both these products are stated as 50% glycerin on their product pages https://naturium.com/products/the-glow-getter-multi-oil-hydrating-body-wash?_pos=3&_sid=4a2e0b8f9&_ss=r and https://prequelskin.com/products/gleanser-non-drying-glycerin-cleanser?variant=45035890835768&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=20447027707&utm_content=155063592129&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAqEnHvQdNi43iW_ATaOqzIgt3PJFr&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqs2niquJiQMVPET_AR0CPgFCEAQYASABEgJ1NPD_BwE\n\nand share the first four ingredients in the exact same order:\n\n> Glycerin, Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine,\nDisodium Cocoamphodiacetate\n\nAnd then they depart from there. The Naturium Glow Getter has some oils and extracts and an additional surfactant (?) Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, while the Prequel Gleanser has other humectants and moisturizers and a probiotic inulin (does that have good effects in a cleanser?). \n\nThe two products have a similar pH:\n* Naturium Glow Getter: 4.2-4.75\n* Prequel Gleanser: 4.5 +/-\n\nThe Naturium says to use on body and the Prequel says to use on face or body. \n\nIn addition to this actually the founder of Prequel, Dr. Sam Ellis, also tried and loved the Naturium Glow Getter body wash and was once a “dermatology advisor” for the brand, perhaps for something unrelated. \nShe mentions that the body Wash was something she received in PR but wasn’t super inspired to try, at first anyway. https://youtu.be/I4IU2AdZewU?si=nHxooNPEFPKH9L5W\n\nI think that there can be a good chance of both of these working in a similar way, but in practice it’s possible they are totally different. Has anyone used Naturium Glow Getter Body Wash for the face, or Prequel Gleanser for the body? Do they have similar texture or lather or residue on the skin? \n\nPrice comparison:\n* Naturium Glow Getter Body Wash: 16.9 oz for $16 (travel size is 3.4 oz for $5)\n* Prequel Gleanser: 13.5 oz for $18\n\nFinally the last consideration that seems to be a big point in negative reviews is how the Naturium does have a scent because of its oils and extracts that has been described as buttered popcorn, rice crispies, marshmallow, and from very mild to super strong (which is it?). While the Gleanser is marketed as non scented. \n\n",

    "body": "**Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser**\n\nIt’s finally time! I have been looking forward to sharing this review with you all for quite awhile. Let’s dive in…\n\nThis water based cleanser from Rovectin is one that I have had my eye on for some time. I’ve mentioned it before…but I love Eunice of Wishtrend/EuniUnni and her videos on YouTube. Pretty much anything she recommends I will give a try! She really loves Rovectin and this cleanser in particular…so I was happy to order it.\n\nLooking into the brand itself made me even more curious/excited about their products. Rovectin is a brand created out of the desire to help those undergoing cancer treatments address the dryness and skin barrier deterioration that can often come with that battle. The first product created was their Anti-Irritant Barrier Repair Ultra Cream…and from there the brand expanded to offer several different “ranges” of products. The overall theme to their products seems to be soothing, calming, and barrier repair. Only one product in their line is focused on exfoliation…and even then it uses a very small amount of LHA.\n\nI was particularly interested in getting my hands on a couple of the Rovectin products not only from Eunice’s recommendation…but also because I knew I would be venturing into the world of Curology/Tretinoin this year. As I’m sure many of you know…these stronger ingredients/products are known to cause irritation and dryness. While it depends on the person, the effects/adjustment period while on Tretinoin can be quite drastic. I decided that incorporating a couple Rovectin products into my routine a bit before starting Curology/Tretinoin would help prep my skin and help support my skin through this adjustment stage. \n\nThe packaging for the Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser is really straight forward and clean (which I love). The pump style bottle is made of a thicker plastic that could be reused which makes me wish Rovectin had refill sizes of this! Aside from that, things are just as straight forward inside the bottle.\n\nFeatured ingredients here include Centella Asiatica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Grape Seed Extract, and Fermented Radish Root Extract. Aside from those…the typical lineup of coconut based surfactants, stabilizers, pH balancers, and preservatives are included as well. The list of extract is fairly low compared to other water based cleansers I have used…and there is no added fragrance or essential oils to speak of. Really, a basic cleanser with no noticeable scent.\n\nApplication is exactly what you would expect from a gel style cleanser. Just about half of a pump is needed to get a really nice lather going (although not super dense/luxurious feeling) for the cleanse. From the first application I noticed a nice feeling of hydration and cooling while using this product. It’s the kind of cleanser that I don’t mind taking a bit of time with to gently massage and work it around. No stinging or harsh feeling here making me want to just rinse and go as quickly as possible. \n\nOnce rinsed, the Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser really impressed me with how well it seemed to cleanse my skin…without leaving me feeling dry or tight. Now, this is all relative to how my skin was adjusting to Tretinoin LOL! I was almost always feeling a little dry…and post cleansing was the time where it was most intense. But, I really think things could have been A LOT worse had I used a harsh/stripping cleanser. This product made me feel comfortable in taking just a bit of time to get dried off and start my routine vs. stumbling for my hydrating toner immediately. Especially now that my skin is more adjusted to Curology…I love the hydrated and “normalized” state this product leaves my skin in. \n\nAnytime I see “fancy” ingredients in an oil or water based cleanser (so 1st and 2nd step) I give some side eye. Products that are rinsed off so quickly haven’t ever lived up to their claims of brightening or anti-aging should they have them (at least for me). But, this Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser was something I was totally fine taking my time with (1-2 minutes)…and in that time I really feel that the various forms of Sodium Hyaluronate and Centella Asiatica were able to provide some mild but noticeable hydration and calming. \n\nOne month into using this product and I’m so glad I worked it into my routine while adjusting to Tretinoin. It wasn’t mind blowing…no incredible scent, miles long list of interesting extracts, or drastic benefit really. It just…worked. And it worked even in the face of some dry, flaky, and itchy skin without making things worse.\n\nThe Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser is one that I think all skin types would get along with. But those with sensitive skin or who are adjusting to a prescription skincare product may find some additional value here. A total win and one that I will repurchase should I experience more skin sensitivity in the future!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, decyl glucoside, glycerin, sodium chloride, citric acid, hyaluronic acid, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium hyaluronate, centella asiatica extract, propanediol, butylene glycol, hexylene glycol, disodium edta, glycine, 1,2-hexanediol, serine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, protease, leucine, alanine, lysine, arginine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, threonine, proline, valine, isoleucine, vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract, histidine, cysteine, methionine, ethylhexylglycerin, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, potassium benzoate, peg-120 methyl glucose trioleate\n\nWhere To Buy (Rovectin US Site $17.00 USD): [https://rovectin.com/collections/cleanser/products/conditioning-cleanser](https://rovectin.com/collections/cleanser/products/conditioning-cleanser)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sa7w1fixwb251.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bcbf8511630a8f1c2bb2c118f3300c287f8c177",

    "body": "I've been feeling super low about my skin and in a last ditch effort to feel like a normal person I booked into Body Shop for a skin consultation. Turns out I have combination skin, possibly hormonal acne and during the consultation the assistant recommended Drops of Light lotion. I've been trying it for nearly a week now and I've noticed a significant improvement with red acne marks and skin texture. However the ingredients are as follows:\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Carbomer, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Palmaria Palmata Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Parfum, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Linalool.\n\nSome of the ingredients are quite irritating and I'm wondering if this is beginners luck, whether I should continue using it and what ingredient you guys think might actually be having the positive effect?\n\nThank you :)",

You can get the Ascorbic via The Ordinary, but if it's working I wouldn't rock the boat! Some of the ingredients might be irritating for others but if it's not for you, you're seeing good results and it's a nice product to use, I don't see a reason to change it.",

        "body": "I'm going to go against the grain and say that the ascorbic acid and aloe are in such low quantities they're unlikely to be doing much of anything. I think what's going on is that your skin really likes glycerin as a moisturiser, and perhaps doesn't like something that's common in other moisturisers (possibly fatty acids? Those are in a lot of lovely moisturisers, but unfortunately some people react badly to them). You haven't mentioned if you were using a moisturiser before/which one, but I think that most likely the difference in your skin is down to it being well-moisturised. If it's working for you then there's no need to change it! But if you did want to experiment with something else, a high glycerin moisturiser would be a good place to start.",

To put it bluntly, if you have sensitive skin I wouldn't put any of those on my face because of the astringent properties.\n\nComparatively speaking though, the Sephora product doesn't contain astringent alcohol, floral byproducts (which can trigger an allergy) or any acids. It does have other triggers, but if it were Cetearyl Alcohol you would definitely be reacting again like the first two.",

I’ve been using the blue-capped (waterproof) Garnier micellar water for years now, but wanted to try some of the other variations of it and had some really bad reactions.\n\nWhen I went to pick some up last week, the store was out of the blue so I ended up getting the pink. I had tried the green in the past and had a negative reaction to it as well, and it took me a few weeks to figure out what product in my routine was the culprit. \n\nWith both the green (for oily skin) and now pink (original, I think?) capped micellar waters, I’ve had the skin around my eyes become extremely tight, dry and flakey, and pink within a couple days of use. The skin around my eyes feels like lizard skin to the touch, and even smiling or looking up pulls the skin so tight that it’s painful. Warm compresses are currently the only thing providing some relief, as I’m afraid to put too much else on my eyelids. Even my undereye cream has a burning sensation when I apply it now. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this, and is there anyone who could possibly offer some insight into what ingredient could be doing this so I can avoid it in the future when finding alternative micellar waters to use? Ingredients for each formula below. \n\nGreen cap (bad reaction):\n695957 8 Aqua/Water, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Poloxamer 184, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Disodium Edta\n\nPink cap (bad reaction):\n695899 1 Aqua/Water, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Disodium Cocoamphodiace Tate, Disodium Edta, Poloxamer 184, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide\n\nBlue cap (no reaction):\nAqua/Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Isohexadecane, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, Hexylene Glycol, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Decyl Glucoside, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide\n\nFrom comparing these lists it looks like I could have an issue with glycerin or poloxamer 184, would either of those cause a reaction like this? Or could there be something else causing it?",

    "body": "Below is a list I have compiled of all of the chemicals used in industrial manufacturing of everything from food to hygiene products that are derived from coconut and/or palm. There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

Those of us with sensitive skin should avoid any flushable wipe (DUDE Wipes, Kirkland Fragrance•Free, Cottonelle, etc.) These wipes contain harmful chemicals that can irritate delicate skin (this can also throw off pH balance in females which can lead to further issues such as urinary tract infections (UTI), yeast infections, and BV). These wet wipes contain chemicals that keep them wet for long periods of time. I'm going to put Kirkland on blast since they have had a recent law suit against them. So what chemicals are in these? Let me list them :) \n\nINGREDIENTS: PURIFIED WATER, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE, CITRIC ACID, DISODIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, PHENOXYETHANOL, SODIUM BENZOATE.\n\nAfter some thorough research on these ingredients, those of us with sensitive skin who are prone to contact dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, etc. should NOT use wet wipe products on either themselves or a child who may have sensitive skin. \n\nWhat are some common symptoms after using wet wipes?:  itching, burning, irritation, allergic reactions \n\nHow can you treat this? Go to a licensed health care professional to help you decipher whether it’s just an allergic or if it’s turned into an infection . Other treatment may include antibiotics if it is an infection or a topical steroid cream which may also be prescribed. Topical steroid treatment that is OTC includes hydrocortisone or cortisone creams/gels (no difference one is brand name while the other is not- but they both contain same ingredients and are used to treat the same ailments). \n\nI truly hope that this can help someone avoid the excruciating pain and suffering that accompanies wet wipe usage. I know that contact dermatitis usually doesn’t become life threatening, but the symptoms are quite uncomfortable. 🥴 \n\nMany of us are uncomfortable talking about a subject matter like this. It’s definitely awkward. By spreading knowledge about this, we can protect our health, our plumbing, and the environment. \n\nPSA: DON’T BUY THESE!!!! It’s not worth it x ",

    "body": "Does anyone know of a good conditioner with water-soluble silicones? For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have some issues with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

It's a lot less stripping than Cetaphil but my face still feels dry after using it. The problem is that I'm not sure which of the ingredients is responsible for this. I ran the ingredients through cosdna and everything was fine, but this product is 10/10 drying my skin. For what it's worth, it lathers up pretty well (like hand soap, but not on Asian foaming cleanser level). Prior to this, I tried the pump version of Hada Labo Gokyujun foaming cleanser and that dried me out too - more so than QV but less so than Cetaphil. I've ordered Cerave Hydrating but I'm still waiting on that sooo yeah. I just want to know what's responsible for my dry skin :( \n\nHere's an ingredient list:\nAqua (Water), Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Acrylates/ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Aminomethyl Propanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.",

Jacquard makes a good one, but Rit is more readily available. I would use that following the instructions, and if you still have marks, soak everything in a bucket with the hottest water that the material can handler and as much OxiClean powder as you can get to dissolve. Let it soak for 24 hours, stirring periodically, then wash. \n\nGood luck, and let us know how it goes!",

My face became flushed and reddened. It's about an hour later and it's still hot. Needless to say this cleanser is not for me and I will go back to my LRP.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what could have caused the reaction? I don't have rosacea or anything (afaik) and my skin isn't super sensitive. I wondered if it might be too harsh of a cleanser, but it's supposed to be for dry skin and can be used all over the body. \n\nI also hate the smell of this. It smells of liquid paraffin, but insanely strong.\n\nI was going to use it up as a hand wash but since I have dyshidrosis I don't want to take the risk. I'll probably give it to my mum. \n\nHere are the ingredients:\nAqua, Petrolatum, Cetearyl Alcohol, Paraffinum Liquidum, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Polysorbate 60, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Sodium Chloride, p-Chloro-m-Cresol, Citric Acid",

Ngoài ra còn bổ sung thành phần hydrating có khả năng kiềm dầu nên các bạn da dầu cũng có thể bon chen với em này được,\n\n### Phù Hợp Với Loại Da\n\nSản Phẩm phù hợp với da khô và nhạy cảm\n\n## 4. Nước Tẩy Trang Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water For Oily & Combination Skin ( Nắp Xanh Lá )\n\nĐối với những bạn da dầu hay nhờn thì cồn khô có khả năng ngừa viêm mụn khá tốt nhưng đây là nhược điểm dành cho những bạn da nhạy cảm, không nên dùng.\n\n### Ưu Điểm:\n\n* Làm sạch dịu nhẹ, lấy đi được bụi bẩn và dầu thừa trên da dễ dàng với công nghệ Mixen có phân từ 1 đầu ưa nước và 1 đầu kỵ nước.\n* Bạn có thể dùng luôn em này kiêm tẩy trang mắt môi\n\n### Nhược Điểm:\n\n* Có mùi khá hắc\n* Không thích hợp với các bạn da nhạy cảm\n\n### Thành Phần Chính\n\n***Thành phần:*** Aqua/Water, Hexylene Glycol (giữ ẩm), Glycerin (giữ ẩm), Alcohol denat., Poloxamer 184 (Tensid), Polyaminopropyl Biguanide (chất bảo quản),Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate (Tensid), Disodium EDTA (chất bảo quản)…\n\n### Phù Hợp Với Loại Da\n\nSản phẩm dành cho da dầu và da hỗn hợp\n\n### Trải Nghiệm Của Người Dùng\n\nKhi sử dụng sản phẩm mình ngửi thấy có mùi hắc ( trong bảng thành phần có chứa cồn khô ). Nhưng bù lại khả năng làm sạch khá tốt.\n\nLúc dùng cảm giác khá mát trên da, mướt và không hề bị châm chích trên da.\n\n## 5. Nước Tẩy Trang Micellar Cleansing Water All In 1 ( Nắp Xanh Dương )\n\nKhả năng làm sạch cực kỳ cao, có khả năng làm sạch mọi lớp trang điểm, phù hợp với mọi loại da ngay cả da nhạy cảm.\n\n### Ưu Điểm:\n\n* Làm sạch lớp trang điểm đậm, ngay cả mascara hay eyeliner chống nước\n* Không gây khô da sau khi sử dụng\n* Không chứa paraben, cồn và dầu nên cực kỳ an toàn với da nhạy cảm\n\n### Thành Phần Chính\n\n***Thành phần:*** Aqua / Water, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Disodium Edta, Poloxamer 184, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide Fil B162919/3…\n\n### Phù Hợp Với Loại Da\n\nDành cho mọi loại da, là bản nâng cấp của chai nắp hồng nhạt.\n\n### Trải Nghiệm Người Dùng\n\nBan đầu mình cũng khá nghi ngờ về khả năng làm sạch của em này vì thường những dòng tẩy trang dạng nước sẽ khó làm sạch hoàn toàn được các lớp trang điểm, nhất là mascara mà em này lại cho hiệu quả cực kỳ xuất sắc nha. Chỉ 2 miếng bông tẩy trang thôi đã lau sạch hoàn toàn rồi.\n\n## 6. Nước Tẩy Trang Garnier Skin Active Pure Active Micellar Cleansing Water ( Nắp Trắng )\n\nĐây là sản phẩm được khuyên dùng với các bạn có da dầu, da mụn với tình trạng da dễ bị tổn thương. \n\n### Ưu Điểm:\n\n* Khả năng làm sạch tốt với công nghệ micellar với một đầu ưa nước và 1 đầu ưa dầu nên dễ dàng loại bỏ đi lớp bụi bẩn, make-up..\n* Bạn cũng có thể dùng luôn em này cho vùng mắt môi vì khả năng làm sạch cả những lớp trang điểm đậm\n\n### Nhược Điểm\n\n* Với thành phần Alcohol Denat (cồn khô) nên các bạn da nhạy cảm không nên dùng.\n\n### Thành Phần Chính\n\n***Thành phần:*** Aqua/Water, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Disodium EDTA, Poloxamer 184, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide.\n\nTrong bảng thành phần của em này có chứa Alcohol Denat(cồn khô) nên nếu bạn nào có da nhạy cảm thì nên cân nhắc nhé.\n\n### Phù Hợp Với Loại Da\n\nSản phẩm phù hợp với **da dầu mụn**\n\n## 7. Tẩy Trang Dạng Dầu Nước Garnier Micellair Reinigingswater ( Nắp Xanh Dương )\n\nTheo như mình tìm hiểu thì đây là bản khác của chai màu vàng thôi nhé! Em này có kết cấu là nước và dầu nữa nên bạn cần lắc đều trước khi sử dụng. Với kết cấu dạng dầu nước như vậy thì em này có nhiều ưu điểm nhờ làm sạch tốt hơn mà lại nhẹ dịu cho da, hoàn toàn không gây bết dính.\n\n### Ưu Điểm:\n\n* Phù hợp cho mọi loại da, đặc biệt là da dầu và da hỗn hợp.\n* Có khả năng làm sạch sâu ngay cả những mỹ phẩm chống nước, đường eyeliner hay mascara mà các loại tẩy trang nước bình thường không làm được\n\n### Nhược Điểm:\n\n* Bạn cần nhũ hóa sau khi sử dụng em này\n* Thành phần có cồn khô không phù hợp cho da nhạy cảm.\n\n### Thành Phần Chính\n\n***Thành phần:*** Alcohol Denat, Cyclopentasiloxane và Isohexadecane, nước hoa ngô cùng một số thành phần khác.\n\n### Phù Hợp Với Loại Da\n\nSản phẩm thích hợp với mọi loại da\n\n## Hướng Dẫn Sử Dụng Nước Tẩy Trang Garnier Hiệu Quả\n\nCác bước sử dụng nước tẩy thường rất đơn giản. Tuy nhiên bạn cũng không nên bỏ qua những hướng dẫn sử dụng theo từng loại da để mang lại hiệu quả tốt nhất nhé.\n\n**Bước 1:** Bạn dùng bông tẩy trang lấy ra một lượng sản phẩm đủ dùng, thường sẽ là 2-3 bông cho các bạn không make-up hay chỉ dùng kem chống nắng, 4-5 bông cho các lớp make-up nhẹ\n\n**Bước 2:** Dùng bông lau nhẹ lên mặt theo hướng hình tròn từ dưới lên trên, từ trong ra ngoài. Lưu ý với vùng mắt hay môi bạn cần giữ bông trong vài giây để dễ làm sạch được những vùng này mà không cần chà xát lên da.\n\n**Bước 3:** Rửa mặt lại với nước thật sạch và dùng sữa rửa mặt, các bước dưỡng da tiếp theo. Có một điều cần lưu ý rằng nếu bạn sử dụng loại màu vàng hay xanh dương có chứa dầu thì bạn cần nhũ hóa da bằng cách dùng 1 ít nước làm ướt tay và massage lên da tầm 1 phút để chuyển hóa lớp dầu thành dạng sữa, tránh gây mụn ẩn. \n\n**Lưu ý :** Các bạn nhớ lắc đều trước khi sử dụng nhé.\n\n## Cách Phân Biệt Nước Tẩy Trang Garnier Thật Giả Hiện Nay\n\nSản phẩm được nhiều người sử dụng nhiều và nổi tiếng thì càng nhiều người muốn chuộc lợi từ đó bằng cách làm giả sản phẩm. Dưới đây là một số cách giúp các bạn phân biệt được đâu là hàng thật và hàng giả. Trách việc các bạn mua trúng hàng kém chất lượng và ảnh hưởng đến da.\n\n**Cách 1:** Khi lắc bạn quan sát bọt khí, hàng thật thì bọt khí nhỏ và đều còn nếu là hàng giả thì bọt khí to nhỏ không đều nhé!\n\n**Cách 2:** Bạn cũng nên quan sát bao bì sản phẩm, nếu chữ bị nhòe đi và nét chữ thô thì có thể sản phẩm của bạn cũng không phải là chính hãng.\n\n**Cách 3:** Lắc đều chai nước tẩy trang của bạn và để yên 1 lúc, nếu chai nước của bạn tách ra được 2 phần nước và dầu như ban đầu thì đó là hàng chuẩn. Ngược lại, nếu chúng hòa vào nhau thì khả năng cao là hàng fake nhé!\n\n## Mua Nước Tẩy Trang Garnier Chính Hãng Ở Đâu?\n\nHiện nay thương hiệu Garnier đã có cửa hàng chính hãng trên các sàn thương mại như Lazada và Shopee các bạn có thể yên tâm mua mà không sợ mua trúng hàng giả kém chất lượng nhé!. \n\n**Nguồn bài viết gốc:**  [Review 7 Loại Nước Tẩy Trang Garnier Chi Tiết Nhất](https://odayreview.com/nuoc-tay-trang-garnier/)",

I could not figure out what could have caused it until I looked online and found that some people have had a bad reaction to Garnier Micellar cleansing water which I had only just started using a couple of days beforehand. I have used this brand of micellar water before (maybe 1-2 years ago) but never have had any kind of allergic reaction. I’ve been researching the ingredients and cannot figure out what could have caused this reaction; it says that the cleansing water is hypoallergenic and for sensitive skin which is what appealed to me, yet i still reacted so badly to it. I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether any of the ingredients could have potentially caused an allergic reaction so that I know to steer clear of them in the future.\nHere is the ingredients list taken from boots:\n\nINGREDIENTS: AQUA / WATER, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, GLYCERIN, POLOXAMER 184, DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE, DISODIUM EDTA, MYRTRIMONIUM BROMIDE (F.I.L B231449/0)\n\nI would really appreciate any suggestions!",

        "body": "Always keep in mind that anyone can become allergic to anything at anytime, even if you’ve been using it daily for years. Also hypoallergenic doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t have an allergic reaction to it, I always thought that’s what it meant too but life experience has taught me otherwise. Like with earrings at the store, they’ll have that sticker on them saying hypoallergenic yet I cannot wear them bcuz I’m allergic to them. Every time I try I get crusty oozing swollen earring holes. But yeah, since you recently brought it back into your routine and have only used it twice and nothing else is new that’s likely the culprit. It’s possible they changed the formula since you last used it too. That really sucks and I hope your skin clears up soon.",

    "body": "Hey! So I read/skimmed through the guidebook in the highlighted section of the reddit page but I'm a tad confused on some things (terminologies and budget wise stuff).\n\nSo, I've been trying to get into caring for my hair a bit more. I have tried for the past 3-ish years (after a relaxer treatment I had) to keep my hair as healthy as possible. It's basically one of the only things that gives me a confidence boost. My hair is currently at waist length and I'm not quite sure if its \"healthy\". Over the years its been really difficult to care for or in general deal with and with its current length its been really overwhelming. I usually don't mind caring for it and I don't really want to cut it as its really important to me.\n\nand thus why I'm here! I'm currently on a budget but I have a few items already (I'm not sure how to use them or when and everywhere I go I get a different answer), I don't care much about the styling as much as I care about it being healthy (for example I have gone and box braided it multiple times before - my hair is 3A I'm pretty sure with varying types in a few spots like behind my ears and I think it can be classified as fine hair).\n\n  \nthe items I have currently are: (I'll include the ingredients since its not a popular brand worldwide)   \n\n\n\\- shampoo 1: Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Potassium Laureth-4 Carboxylate, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool.\n\n  \n\\- shampoo 2: Aqua, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Lactic Acid, PPG-3 Caprylyl Ether, Hydrolyzed Pearl, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n\n\n\\- hair mask: Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil (Almond Oil), Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan Oil), Glycerin, Pearl Powder, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Sodium PCA, Proline, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sodium Lactate, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n  \n\\- Conditioner: Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, PPG-3 Caprylyl Ether, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Pearl, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Sodium PCA, Proline, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sodium Lactate, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n\n\n\\- Leave-in cream: Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Dioleoylethyl Hydroxyethylmonium Methosulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene.\n\n  \nit might be worth noting I do have a detangling spray but I rarely use it  \nI don't exactly have any oils as Ive never known how to use them unlike the hair mask (I usually put it on wet hair and let it sit for 30mins - an hour with a cap on)\n\n  \nI do have other shampoos like head and shoulders and dollar store shampoos ofc but I also have a \"final wash shampoo\" which I'm not too sure what to do with: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-10, Potassium Sorbate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n  \nI don't exactly know what I need more let alone how to use what I already have. I do know I should get my ends trimmed soon but I want to try and keep as much of the length as possible/repair the hair. Please if anyone can help me figure out what to do or how to fix this please help.",

For example one ingredient night be drying, but another may negate the drying quality.\n\nWe also don't know the pH of the product based on the ingredient list, which can have an impact on how the hair responds. Generally products with a pH of 4.5-6 are safest for the hair and help protect the color.\n\nHave you noticed color fading and are trying to determine what the cause is? If so, perhaps you could tell us about your routine and we can try to identify what might be doing it. Do you know your hair's porosity?",

Bạn có thể dùng tẩy da chết vật lý chứa các chứa các hạt scrub siêu nhỏ để khi massage trên da sẽ cuốn theo lớp sừng và da chết đi ra. Hoặc có thể dùng sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết hóa học  có nồng độ axit nhẹ rồi từ từ nâng dần lên, với sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết có BHA nên sử dụng nồng độ 1-2%, sau 1-2 tháng nâng lên 4%, còn với AHA nên sử dụng từ nồng độ 3-5% sau nâng lên 7-10%\n\nBước 4: Đắp mặt nạ đất sét/ than hoạt tính\n\nĐắp mặt nạ đất sét không chỉ giúp làm sạch sâu bên trong lỗ chân lông mà còn giúp loại bỏ dầu thừa, bụi bẩn trên da đem lại hiệu quả trị mụn tốt hơn. Cách thực hiện vô cùng đơn giản, chỉ cần đắp mặt nạ 1 lớp mỏng trên da và giữ trong vòng 15-20 phút sau đó rửa sạch lại bằng nước ấm.\n\nBước 5: Nặn mụn\n\nSau khi đắp mặt nạ khoảng 10 phút, lỗ chân lông đã được làm sạch và mở rộng hơn giúp dễ dàng tiến hành bước nặn mụn. Bạn hãy rửa sạch tay sau đó sử dụng cây nặn mụn đã được khử trùng sau đó dùng lực quét cây nặn mụn nhẹ nhàng trên da để loại bỏ nhân mụn.\n\nBước 6: Đắp mặt nạ phục hồi\n\nSau khi nặn mụn đầu đen, làn da của bạn bị tác động và trở nên nhạy cảm, vì thế bạn cần được đắp mặt nạ để làm dịu da, chống viêm và giảm thâm sau nặn mụn. Có thể sử dụng mặt nạ giấy, mặt nạ sủi bọt, mặt nạ gel,…\n\nBước 7: Sử dụng Toner/ Serum và Kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn da khô, sau khi đã nặn mụn và đắp mặt nạ, bạn có thể tiến hành cả 3 bước dưỡng da tiếp theo: dùng toner, serum và kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn có làn da dầu: Sau khi đắp mặt nạ nên chọn 1 trong 3 bước dưỡng da trên để tạo lớp bảo vệ, giúp da mau lành vết thương sau nặn mụn\n\nƯu tiên các sản phẩm không có hương liệu, không cồn, kết cấu mỏng nhẹ và chứa ít gốc dầu gây bít tắc da\n\nBước 8: Chấm mụn\n\nNếu là người mới bắt đầu sử dụng các sản phẩm chấm mụn, bạn nên sử dụng các dòng sản phẩm có chứa hoạt chất Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% hoặc Adapalene. Sau một khoảng thời gian, khi đã quen với các hoạt chất này có thể đổi sang sử dụng Retinol-A hoặc Teetrea oil. Tuy nhiên, Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% và Adapalene vẫn là 2 hợp chất được các chuyên gia da liễu khuyên nên sử dụng.\n\nBước 9: Dùng kem chống nắng\n\nSau các bước chăm sóc trên đừng quên thoa kem chống nắng trước khi ra ngoài vào ban ngày nhé! Kem chống nắng sẽ giúp bảo vệ làn da, giúp các dưỡng chất được hấp thụ hoàn toàn mà không bị mất đi, đem lại hiệu quả tốt nhất.\n\n# Một Số Lưu Ý Trong Quá Trình Chăm Sóc Da Mụn Đầu Đen, Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nGiữ da luôn sạch và thông thoáng\n\nHạn chế sử dụng những đồ uống có cồn, caffeine và các chất kích thích,…\n\nBỏ các thói quen xấu: sờ tay lên mặt, nặn mụn khi chưa sát trùng tay,…\n\nKiểm soát lượng bã nhờn trên da bằng cách: uống đủ nước, ngủ đủ giấc và dùng giấy thấm dầu thường xuyên\n\nBảo vệ da tránh các tác nhân từ bên ngoài: dùng kem chống nắng, đeo khẩu trang\n\nBổ sung dưỡng chất cho da: Vitamin C, A, B3,..\n\nCó thể đến spa nặn mụn theo chu kì 3 – 7 ngày/ lần\n\n Không lạm dụng các biện pháp lột mụn vì sẽ khiến lỗ chân lông to và dễ tổn thương hơn\n\nTại Sao Da Dầu Thường Gặp Trình Trạng Bị Mụn Và Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nNhững người có làn da dầu, da nhờn thường có lỗ chân lông to hơn những người có làn da khô và da thường. Nguyên nhân là do bã nhờn và dầu trên da quá nhiều khiến bụi bẩn dễ dàng bám dính lại, các chất này có tích tụ trên da khiến lỗ chân lông càng ngày càng nở ra, thậm chí gây nên mụn trứng cá. \n\nHậu quả là, sau khi nặn mụn, vùng da bị kéo dãn đó không hồi phục về hiện trạng ban đầu, lỗ chân lông trở nên to và rõ hơn, hình thành sẹo rỗ.\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Mụn Đầu Đen\n\nDa dầu có tuyến mồ hôi hoạt động cực kỳ mạnh mẽ. Chính vì vậy cũng là nguyên nhân hình thành mụn đầu đen. Cơ chế hình thành mụn đầu đen là do tuyến dầu trên da hoạt động mạnh như không thể thoát ra khỏi bề mặt da do lỗ chân lông bị bít tắc bởi bụi bẩn, tế bào chết hay sản phẩm trang điểm và vi khuẩn. Khi các nốt mụn trong lỗ chân lông tiếp xúc với không khí sẽ bị oxy hóa và nhân mụn chuyển sang màu đen sậm.\n\n**Nguồn bài viết gốc:** [Review 10 Loại Sữa Rửa Mặt Trị Mụn Đầu Đen Cực Kì Hiệu Quả](https://odayreview.com/sua-rua-mat-tri-mun-dau-den/)",

        "body": "The way to identify protein is to look for the words \"Hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ protein\" in the ingredient list.  This one has Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein pretty close to the end of the list, I would not say that it's high in protein.\n\nUltimately even if it were high in proteins, it's unlikely they would make a difference in the performance of a shampoo.  Shampoos are only left on the hair for a minute or two, and they are mainly made to wash things ***out*** of the hair; it's unusual for any of the ingredients to be left behind in the hair, the surfactants would try to wash them away with the rest of the dirt, oils, & product buildup in the hair, unless the shampoo formulators have used [a special trick](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/lmbrwj/how_does_dimethicone_behave_in_a_sodium_laureth/) to prevent that.  But you normally only see that with cationic conditioning agents or silicones.\n\nSome chemists even question whether proteins are even capable of staying in the hair in a rinse-out conditioner.  The reason why is explained here: [https://www.instagram.com/p/CXjEvdOof8r/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXjEvdOof8r/)",

Those of us with sensitive skin should avoid any flushable wipe (DUDE Wipes, Kirkland Fragrance•Free, Cottonelle, etc.) These wipes contain harmful chemicals that can irritate delicate skin (this can also throw off pH balance in females which can lead to further issues such as urinary tract infections (UTI), yeast infections, and BV). These wet wipes contain chemicals that keep them wet for long periods of time. I'm going to put Kirkland on blast since they have had a recent law suit against them. So what chemicals are in these? Let me list them :) \n\nINGREDIENTS: PURIFIED WATER, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE, CITRIC ACID, DISODIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, PHENOXYETHANOL, SODIUM BENZOATE.\n\nAfter some thorough research on these ingredients, those of us with sensitive skin who are prone to contact dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, etc. should NOT use wet wipe products on either themselves or a child who may have sensitive skin. \n\nWhat are some common symptoms after using wet wipes?:  itching, burning, irritation, allergic reactions \n\nHow can you treat this? Go to a licensed health care professional to help you decipher whether it’s just an allergic or if it’s turned into an infection . Other treatment may include antibiotics if it is an infection or a topical steroid cream which may also be prescribed. Topical steroid treatment that is OTC includes hydrocortisone or cortisone creams/gels (no difference one is brand name while the other is not- but they both contain same ingredients and are used to treat the same ailments). \n\nI truly hope that this can help someone avoid the excruciating pain and suffering that accompanies wet wipe usage. I know that contact dermatitis usually doesn’t become life threatening, but the symptoms are quite uncomfortable. 🥴 \n\nMany of us are uncomfortable talking about a subject matter like this. It’s definitely awkward. By spreading knowledge about this, we can protect our health, our plumbing, and the environment. \n\nPSA: DON’T BUY THESE!!!! It’s not worth it x \n\nFor more content like this feel free to give me a follow at my subreddit r/AllergenstoitALL ",

The first two times I had severe flare ups (I hadn't put 2 and 2 together yet), I went for a STI screening and started medicating with yeast infection meds just in case. Came back negative for all STIs and Yeast. Stopped using the wipes during these flare up because anything down there would burn, and coincidentally cleared up after a few weeks. The other day, I used one for the first time in months and guess who feels like their southern regions are on fire again with a rash?! Ugh, never using these again.

It could have interacted with metal ions, creating insoluble complexes that adhere to the surface.\n\n2: Surfactants like cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine may have reacted with plastic components, leading to discoloration.(less likely cause idk what material is used )\n\n3: Citric acid and gluconolactone can react with metal alloys (e.g., aluminum, magnesium) or coatings, causing oxidation or corrosion that appears as brown or yellowish stains (also less likely cause  idk if the back is metal glass or some polymere chain ) \n\ni cant truely say if one of these reasons are true. other reason are even more less likely but in short its not that easy to say what happened if we dont actually know what material the back is made out off. it also could be due to organic compounds from  dead skin residue sticking on the back off the phone or dirt that can theoretically also cause reactions",

BRANDT SKINCARE Microdermabrasion Age Defying Exfoliator 2 oz\n\n**^What ^It ^Does:**\n\nDR. BRANDT SKINCARE Microdermabrasion Age Defying Exfoliator is a powerful exfoliating treatment that will get your skin smooth, clear, and feeling like new. Ultra-fine aluminum oxide crystals and lactic acid buff away dead skin cells leaving your complexion ultra-radiant and glowy. Gently massage onto damp skin, leave it on for one to two minutes, then rinse. It also helps minimize the look of fine lines, dark spots, and uneven texture. \n\n111SKIN Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Booster is a hydrating booster serum that is your new secret weapon for soft, dewy skin. It’s full of hyaluronic acid—a humectant that draws moisture to your skin—to help combat dehydration and dryness and help make your complexion more smooth and plump.\n\nKORRES Apothecary Wild Rose Night-Brightening Sleeping Facial is a fluffy souffle-like formula with vitamin C and wild rose extract that helps brighten up dull skin and improve uneven tone and texture while you snooze.\n\nONEKIND Dream Cream Nighttime Moisturizer is made with repairing rosehip oil, anti-inflammatory chamomile, and moisturizing squalane that works its magic while you sleep so you can wake up to healthier, more youthful-looking skin.\n\nMASQUEOLOGY 24k Gold Under Eye Gel is like a good night’s sleep in a bottle (for your eyes, at least), and is formulated with gold, collagen, and niacinamide to help depuff and brighten dark under-eye bags and circles. 24K gold has been used in skincare for hundreds of years due to its anti-aging properties and can reduce the breakdown of elastin and collagen, increasing the suppleness of your skin.\n\nTHE CRÈME SHOP Rose & Gold Fusion Sheet Mask is a fusion sheet mask that delivers the benefits of two powerful ingredients plus the added hydration of hyaluronic acid. Rose oil soothes, calms, hydrates and revitalizes tired skin, while astringent properties help reduce oil production. 24k gold stimulates skin cells for improved circulation and intense brightening, and helps increase skin elasticity for resilience. \n\n**^Ingredients-**\n\n\n\nKORRES Apothecary Wild Rose Night-Brightening Sleeping Facial\nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Triheptanoin, Alcohol Denat., Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cera Alba/Beeswax/Cire D’Abeille, Lecithin, Imperata Cylindrica Root Extract, Acacia Decurrens/Jojoba/Sunflower Seed Wax Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Distarch Phosphate, Galactoarabinan, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Lactic Acid, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Gluceptate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum\n\nONEKIND Dream Cream Nighttime Moisturizer\nAqua/Water/Eau, Coco-Caprylate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Fruit Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Sodium Phytate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Seed Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Ormenis Multicaulis (Moroccan Chamomile) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Oil, Linalool, Canola Oil, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\n\n111SKIN Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Booster\nAqua / Water / Eau, Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid, Cellulose Gum, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Sodium PCA, Fructose, Urea, Niacinamide, Sodium Benzoate, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Glycine, Inositol, Tocopherol\n\nMASQUEOLOGY 24k Gold Under Eye Gel\nWater, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan), Dipropylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Ceratonia Siliqua Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Niacinamide, Methylparaben, Potassium Chloride, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Calcium Lactate, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, CI 77491, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginko Biloba Nut Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tin Oxide Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Gold\n\nTHE CRÈME SHOP Rose & Gold Fusion Sheet Mask\nWater, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Colloidal Gold, Rose Canina Fruit oil, Hydroxyacetophenone, Betaine, Carbomer, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Arginine, Trideceth-10, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nDR.

        "body": "That’s a lot of text and a lot of products. \n\nYou should avoid putting that much on your face. \n\nThe usual order goes like this:\nCleanse - treat - protect\n\nYou could start with micellar water to remove makeup (Cerave micellar water is a good choice), then cleanse with a gentle (that’s important) cleanser. \nThen you put any treatment you are using (you should avoid using much, unless needed). \nAnd finally you use a good moisturizer (depending on the type of your skin) and sunscreen. \n\nI recommend treating only with vitamin c serum / niacinamide in the morning and retinol at night. Retinol is the most effective way to even the skin and reduce wrinkles and spots. \nAvoid any products with alcohol denat (so most toners and astringents) and exfoliants.",
