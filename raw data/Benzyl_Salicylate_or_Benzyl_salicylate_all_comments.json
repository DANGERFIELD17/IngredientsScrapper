    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

På denne tid af året bliver jeg nemt solskoldet, resten af året er det for min huds skyld + jeg bruger hudpleje der gør huden endnu mere sensitiv overfor solen (glykolsyre). \n\nDet mest vigtige for mig er at det er behageligt at bruge, hvis det ikke er det så får jeg det ikke taget på... I den forbindelse er jeg glad for Niveas ansigts solcremer bl.a. deres spf 50 face til sensitive hud (dog er den dårlig under makeup) og dem fra Garnier til ansigtet, de har bl.a. en tyndtflydende solcrememælk der tørrer mat på huden. \n\nJeg har prøvet Matas egen solcreme, men jeg kan slet ikke deres konsistenser! \n\nTil kroppen er enten et apoteksmærke, som f.eks. La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Avene osv. gode og ellers så laver Garnier og Nivea hæderlige solcremer til gode priser. \n\nI forhold til din liste af ingredienser du valgte også at ekskludere, synes jeg især det er interessant at sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, denatured alcohol og propylene glycol er inkluderet. De er alle fire totalt almindelige ingredienser i hudpleje (Dog er sodium lauryl sulfate og sodium laureth sulfate mest almindelige i sæber og renseprodukter) og jeg forstår ikke hvorfor du har skåret dem væk? Denatureret sprit fordamper efter applikation (og kan hjælpe med at solcremen tørrer ind) og ja det kan være udtørrende i nogle formularer, men ved hudpleje er det altid vigtigt at tage højde for formularen og ikke de individuelle ingredienser kun. Du kender jo selv at du kan bruge vand, mel, sukker og æg til at lave en del forskellige opskrifter, hvis du varierer metode og forhold... \n\nPropylene glycol i solcreme kan hjælpe solcremen med at sprede sig bedre på huden og hjælper med at opløse andre ingredienser i solcremen, da det er er godt solvent til mere hydrofobe stoffer. Det eneste jeg ved til kan være problematisk ved propylene alcohol er at det kan være irriterende for huden i høje koncentrationer (50% eller mere), men du vil sjældent se det brugt så koncentreret :p\n\nMichelle Wong, som er kosmetisk kemiker og har en PhD i kemi har skrevet på hendes blog om både [propylene glycol](https://labmuffin.com/what-are-propylene-and-butylene-glycol-and-are-they-safe/) og [SLS](https://labmuffin.com/whats-wrong-with-sls/).",

Dertil er det også vigtigt at forholde sig til hvor dataen, som disse vurderinger er lavet på, kommer fra. Ikke alle studier holder lige meget vand i forhold til at kunne drage konklusioner på, og medmindre man ved hvordan sådanne studier skal læses er det super nemt at fejlformidle indholdet af dem. \n\nJeg er dog glad for der bliver belyst hvilke navne parfume kan gå under, for parfume der sniger sig ind i produkter er et problem for allergikere og folk med følsomheder. \n\nMen tag lige og vend den her med en kemiker, ik?

    "body": "Background to this text post: \n\nI had made two replies -- [here is the first comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ugucv/spending_that_much_on_moisturizer_is_stupid_i/cei011t) and [this is my second comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ugucv/spending_that_much_on_moisturizer_is_stupid_i/ceihi8p) -- to two comments that a person made on a post in this subreddit.  Doing that research inspired me to make this post.\n\nFirstly, Lancome is owned by L'oreal.  An example of research that L'oreal has done is with stem cells and [the first L'oreal brand product that benefited from that is Lancome's Absolue Precious Cells](http://www.loreal.com/research-innovation/push-back-the-boundaries-of-knowledge/the-revelation-of-stem-cells.aspx).  In fact, [Lancome is a L'oreal Luxe brand](http://www.loreal.com/Brands.aspx?topcode=CorpTopic_Brand).  \n\nThere is no guarantee that the L'oreal products work exactly the same as the Lancome products, as there tends to be less of the specialized ingredients in the L'oreal products and that there tends to be some variation of other ingredients in the products.  An example of this is that in Lancome's Vissionaire serum, there is [4% of the LR2412 molecule](http://www.lancome-usa.com/Visionnaire/1000680,default,pd.html?start=1&q=visionnaire&cgid=skincare_visionnaire&cm_vc=search) while L'oreal's Youth Code Texture Perfector Serum Concentrate has [2% of the LR2412 molecule](http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/Products/Skin-Care/Treatments/Youth-Code-Texture-Perfector-Serum-Concentrate.aspx).  So here is the list I have compiled up:\n\n**Eye Products:**\n\n* Absolue Eye Premium Bx is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Eye Cream\n* Rénergie is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Eye\n* High Résolution Eye Refill - 3X is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream\n\n\n**Treatments and Serums:**\n\n* Vissionaire is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Texture Perfector\n* Génefique Cream Serum (as serum) is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Serum Intense\n* Génefique Eye Light-Pearl is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Youth Regenerating Skincare Eye Cream\n\n**Moisturizers:**\n\n* Bienfait Aqua Vital Cream, Bienfait Aqua Vital Lotion, & Bienfait Multi-Vital Night is similar to L’oreal’s Ideal Moisture Even Skin Tone All Skin Types Day/Night Cream\n* High Résolution Refill - 3X is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream\n* Nutrix Royal & Nutrix is similar to L’oreal’s Hydra-Renewal Continuous Moisture Cream\n* Rénergie Cream is similar to L’oreal’s Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Face, Neck & Chest\n* Rénergie Lift Multi-Action Night Cream & High Résolution Night Refill - 3X are similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle & Firming Night Cream\n* Génefique Repair Youth Activating Night Cream & Génefique Cream Serum (as moisturizer) is similar to L’oreal’s Youth Code Youth Regenerating Skincare Day/Night Cream\n\n**Makeup Removers/Cleanser:**\n\n* Effacil is similar to L’oreal’s Clean Artiste 100% Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover\n* Bifacil is similar to L’oreal’s Clean Artiste Waterproof & Long Wearing Eye Makeup Remover\n* Absolue Premium BX is similar to L’oreal’s RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser\n* Lancome Eau Micellaire Douceur is similar to Skin Perfection 3 in 1 Purifying Micellar Solution (available in some non-U.S. markets).\n    * Lancome Eau Micellaire Douceur\n        \n        **aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Poloxamer 184,** Dihydrocholeth-30, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Benzyl Salicylate, Propylene Glycol, **Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Disodium EDTA,** Rosa Gallica Extract, Parfum.\n\n   * L'oreal Paris Skin Perfection 3 in 1 Purifying Micellar Solution\n\n        **aqua, hexylene glycol, glycerin, poloxamer 184, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, disodium EDTA,** polyaminopropyl biguanide.\n\n\nFor my sources to figure out L'oreal products that are similar to Lancome products, I use ingredient lists and product descriptions on L'oreal's website as well as Lancome's website.  If I could not find an ingredient list on either of those websites, I used Cosdna.  \n\nI hope this list was/is able to help some of you awesome people out.\n\nEDIT 1: added another product to the Makeup Removers/Cleanser section that nihilcupio gave in the comments.

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

Some retailers have the ingredients list with zinc oxide only, and then the official packaging and website say its a chemical sunscreen (both english and korean), and also, the official packaging also lists fragrance just above carbomer (from the naver posts that i saw), whereas the official korean website ingredients list has fragrance at the bottom of the ingredients list, maybe bc of different ingredients list laws in korea…. lol idk anymore its confusing.",

So what’s hot this year?

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

        "body": "I am probably gonna get downvoted to hell for this, but Biotique Neem Margosa Shampoo is the only one that seems to work on my hair. All my life, I used sulphate shampoos.. Tried all of them out there, from cheapest to most expensive, but none worked for my hair. Cut to Biotique, and my hair got so smooth and shiny. Hairfall reduced tremendously. Hair growth got better, less split ends. Then I recently switched to other sulphate free shampoos, and no matter how less or more I apply, my hair looks so dead and dull. So, I don't care if Biotique is sulphate or sulphate free. I just know its gentle, and even if I use more, it never harms me. It always repairs my hair beyond my expectation (I suffer from depression so I can go for long periods without taking care of my hair) and makes them silky smooth and in no need of any extra treatment. Its magic for me.",

It's impossible to last without sulphates. Most CG shampoos also have milder sulphates because they're cleansing agents. Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "*Update 2024:  I consider myself a better perfumer now than I was at the time I originally shared this two years ago.  I recently decided to revisit this formula and make some improvements.  While the philosophy underlying the formula remains the same, the exact formula has now been updated and improved.*\n\nI offer here the culmination of a project I’ve been working on recently:  **A starter fragrance formula for people new to the hobby**.  I’d read in a variety of places that “It takes a year before you’ll make anything actually wearable.”  In my case, that proved to be fairly accurate\\*, but nevertheless, statements like that can sound discouraging to a lot of would-be perfumers.\n\n\\* (It wasn’t until about a year after I got started in perfumery, I composed a fragrance that eventually drew my first unsolicited compliment from a stranger.)\n\nTo my mind, a big part of the problem is that the field of perfumery doesn’t have a rich library of beginner-friendly formulas to start with and learn from.  Compare this to learning to play the piano:  There are *tons* of simplified arrangements of popular songs which make it fun to play even in the early stages of one’s development.  Since perfumery doesn’t really have the equivalent at this time, though, a person has to be particularly dedicated to make it through the early stages of one’s perfumery journey.\n\nTrue, demo formulas can be found in spades on TGSC, but (a) it’s not particularly easy to navigate the site, especially when looking for formulas, and (b) basically all the formulas fail to achieve one or more of the following traits that I think make for a good starter formula.  (Of course, that was never really the point of those formulas; they’re meant to demonstrate the effect of a particular material by a given manufacturer, not to be a starting place for a new perfumer.)  In particular, **I think a good starter formula should**:\n\n1. **Use only common materials that should be in every perfumer’s collection.**\n2. **Use materials in amounts that are easy to measure.**  (For example, the amounts in the formula below could be easily translated to parts per *hundred*.)\n3. **Act as a “skeleton” to make modification/personalization easy.**\n\nWhat follows is a woody-floral fragrance (masculine-leaning) that I believe successfully achieves the aforementioned goals.  It smells pleasant on its own, but since it’s a “skeleton,” it can also be modified easily; all you have to do is make *one change* (omit something, replace something, add something, …), and then you’ll have something that’s truly and uniquely *yours*.  Some potentially helpful study/practice notes follow, as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Parts per thousand|Material Name|CAS number|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|120|bergamot givco 104|(mixture)|1|\n|120|hedione|24851-98-7||\n|120|iso e super|54464-57-2|2|\n|80|bacdanol|28219-61-6||\n|80|dihydromyrcenol|18479-58-8||\n|80|ethylene brassylate|105-95-3||\n|80|isobornyl acetate|125-12-2||\n|80|romandolide|236391-76-7||\n|80|lilyflore|285977-85-7|3|\n|40|cyclamen aldehyde|103-95-7|2|\n|20|benzyl salicylate|118-58-1|2|\n|20|coranol|83926-73-2||\n|20|helional|1205-17-0|2|\n|10|ambroxan (ambrofix)|6790-58-5||\n|10|citronellol|106-22-9|2|\n|10|coumarin|91-64-5|2|\n|10|geraniol|106-24-1|2|\n|10|norlimbanol (timberol)|70788-30-6||\n|10|veramoss (evernyl)|4707-47-5||\n\n^(1) You don’t have to specifically use the Givaudan bergamot base listed here, and indeed, you could use real bergamot essential oil.  You do need to make sure you’re using bergapten-free bergamot if you go the natural route, though, to avoid phototoxicity.  What I like about the Givco 104 base, in any case, is that it’s lighter in color than natural bergamot, it’s performant, and it’s highly unlikely to be discontinued any time in the foreseeable future.\n\n^(2) These materials are potential skin sensitizers, so they are subject to restriction by IFRA (International Fragrance Association).  Keep this in mind if/when you make modifications of your own.  [The IFRA safe-use library](https://ifrafragrance.org/safe-use/library) is pretty easy to use, but note that (a) you should search by CAS number, since a lot of chemicals go by many different names, not all of which will yield results, (b) when reviewing their documents (such as [this one for citronellol](https://ifrafragrance.org/pdf/web/viewer.html?file=/standards/IFRA_STD_022.pdf)), you’ll mostly be concerned with the “Category 4” percent in the Restriction Limits section, which corresponds to \\[wearable\\] fine fragrances, and (c) the percents listed are maximum percentages in the *finished product* (meaning, after dilution with ethanol or whatever is your carrier), so the quantities you’re allowed to use in the concentrate are actually quite a bit higher than you might initially think.\n\n^(3) By far, my favorite lily-of-the-valley aromachemical is Lilial, but since it’s banned from use in commercial cosmetics in the EU as of March, most people are trying to move away from it.  I like Lilyflore, and I recommend it, although it’s a smidge pricier than some of its brethren.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n===== **ADDITIONAL NOTES: =====**\n\nAfter mixing the concentrate and diluting it with alcohol, keep it in a bottle **and leave it alone for at least 24 hours**.  It improves *considerably* by the next day.\n\nWhen you’re ready to evaluate the fragrance, test it on various media, including both skin and on a fragrance strip.\n\nHere are some ideas for initial learning exercises.  Take careful notes as you complete these exercises, and be sure to clearly label each batch so you don’t forget which is which:\n\n* Make a version that omits the musks (both the ethylene brassylate and the romandolide) and compare to the original.  What differences do you notice?\n* Make a version without the hedione and compare it to the original.\n* Make a version without the iso e super and compare.\n* Make a version without either hedione or iso e super, and compare.\n* Make a version without ambroxan, and also make a version with *quadruple* the amount of ambroxan as the original.\n* Omit, halve, and/or double the amount of another ingredient and compare to the original.  (Don't double the amount of cyclamen aldehyde, though.  It's already close to the safety ceiling when diluting the concentrate down to around 15%.)\n\nFinally, to really make this *your formula*, do some experiments of your own and make one or more unique changes.  I do recommend taking notes as you go, and making only one change at a time to make it easier to isolate and evaluate the effects of your change(s).  Some ideas to get the ball rolling:\n\n* Try different musk material(s).\n* Try different sandalwood materials (in place of the bacdanol).\n* Add some natural materials, such as cedarwood or vetiver.\n* Add in something completely different, such as calone.\n\nHave fun!",

        "body": "Love it! \n\nI wanted to offer some feedback on the learning exercises: there's a methodology I've used since starting this hobby that I feel like has been very successful in that it's extremely efficient at teaching about the impacts of ingredients in a structured sort of way. I posted a comment about it earlier today and I wanted to incorporate this formula into that framework.\n\n**1.** **Gather your materials:**\n\n34x 5mL glass vials ([these](https://www.amazon.com/Furnido-Essential-Aromatherapy-Colognes-Business-Pack/dp/B07SDLSQZH/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1X6ZZGIA72NKX&keywords=5ml+glass+dropper&qid=1654730647&s=beauty&sprefix=5ml+glass+dropper%2Cbeauty%2C77&sr=1-3) are as good as any)\n\n1x 30mL glass vial \n\nSome way of labelling the vials\n\nAll the ingredients plus perfumers alcohol\n\n**2. Make the following \"base batch\" in the 30mL glass vial**\n\n* 3.5g\tbergamot givco 104\n* 3.5g\thedione\n* 3.5g\tiso e super\n* 2.25g\tbacdanol\n* 1.25g\tdihydromyrcenol\n* 0.5g\tcitronellol\n* 0.5g\tgeraniol\n\n**3. For each of the below materials, mix 0.5g with 4.5g alcohol and label it as a 10% dilution. (e.g. \"Lilial 10%\")**\n\n* hexyl cinnamic aldehyde\n* allyl amyl glycolate\n* ambroxan (ambrofix)\n* coumarin\n* floralozone\n* norlimbanol (timberol)\n* veramoss (evernyl)\n\n**4. For each of the 13 ingredients that aren't in the base batch, label two vials with that ingredient name, and put a plus sign by one and a minus sign by the other. (e.g. \"Coumarin +\" and \"Coumarin -\".) Separate all the plus sign vials into one group and the minus sign vials into another. Label the final vial \"Full Formula\".**\n\n**5.** **Put 0.5g of the \"base batch\" mix into each vial. There should be 27: 13 plus vials, 13 minus vials, and 1 \"full formula\" vial.** \n\n**6.  For each of the 13 ingredients that aren't in the base batch, add an amount (listed below) to each \"minus\" vial** ***EXCEPT THE MINUS VIAL WITH THAT INGREDIENT'S NAME ON IT.*** **Then add that same amount to the one \"plus\" vial with that ingredient's name on it. Then add that same amount to the vial labelled \"Full Formula\".** \n\n*Note: what you are doing here is two exercises. Firstly, you are creating multiple versions of the formula but each one is missing a single ingredient. These are the minus vials, and these will help you understand the impact an ingredient has by seeing what a formula smells like without it. Secondly, you are creating multiple versions of a simple accord with single ingredients added to it. These are the plus vials, and these will help you understand what impact adding an ingredient has.* \n\n*The amounts of each ingredient that you will add to the vials is below:*\n\n0.08g\tethylene brassylate  \n0.08g\tromandolide  \n0.06g\tcedramber (cedryl methyl ether)  \n0.06g\tcyclamen aldehyde  \n0.06g\thelional  \n0.06g\tlilyflore  \n0.2g\t10% dilution of: hexyl cinnamic aldehyde  \n0.1g\t10% dilution of: allyl amyl glycolate  \n0.1g\t10% dilution of: ambroxan (ambrofix)  \n0.1g\t10% dilution of: coumarin  \n0.1g\t10% dilution of: floralozone  \n0.1g\t10% dilution of: norlimbanol (timberol)  \n0.1g\t10% dilution of: veramoss (evernyl)\n\n**7. Top each 5ml vial off with perfumer's alcohol (it should be about 3.5mL of alcohol) and let sit for 24 hours. Fill the \"base batch\" bottle about halfway with perfumer's alcohol. Spray each bottle (including the \"base batch\") onto a labelled test strip.** \n\n**8. Start by smelling the \"base batch\" and take notes. Then, smell each of the \"plus\" vials, which correspond to the base batch plus a single ingredient. Take notes as to what smells different about the accord when that particular ingredient is added.** \n\n**9. Then smell the \"full formula\" and take notes. Then, smell each of the \"minus\" vials, which correspond to the full formula minus a single ingredient. Take notes as to what smells different about the accord when that particular ingredient is removed. Specifically highlight any ingredients where you simply can't tell the difference.** \n\n**10. Turn the \"plus\" test strips upside down and try to identify, without looking, each ingredient. Take notes of whether you were successful, and what made you pick each particular strip.** \n\n**11. Turn the \"minus\" test strips upside down and try to identify, without looking, each ingredient's omission. Take notes of whether you were successful, and what made you pick each particular strip.** \n\n**12. Wait 24 hours, then repeat steps 8-11.** \n\n**13. For extra credit, each day, spray one wrist with the full formula and the other wrist with one of the \"minus\" vials where you couldn't tell the difference between the full formula and the omission. Smell throughout the day and see if you can detect any differences on the skin.** \n\nBy following these steps, you will very quickly get intimately acquainted with the impact (or lack thereof) of particular ingredients.",

Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

    "body": "The **51st Amendment of the International Fragrance Association (IFRA)** introduced stricter regulations on various fragrance components to ensure safety and sustainability. While these changes aim to protect consumers, they pose significant challenges for perfumers, especially when reformulating iconic classics and beloved contemporary creations.\n***\n**Compliance Deadlines**\n\n**New Formulas:**\n\n* Prohibited ingredients: *August 30, 2023*\n* Full compliance: *March 30, 2024*\n\n**Existing Formulas:**\n\n* Prohibited ingredients: *July 30, 2024*\n* Full compliance: *October 30, 2025*\n***\n\n**Key Ingredient Changes and Impacts on Perfumes**\n\n**1. Hydroperoxides from Linalool and Limonene**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Linalool\n* Limonene\n\n**What Changed:**  \nStricter limits have been imposed on the hydroperoxides formed when Linalool and Limonene oxidize. These allergens are prevalent in floral and citrus accords.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Shalimar* \\- The bergamot-heavy opening will feel less sparkling and effervescent, softening its characteristic freshness.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Dior Sauvage EDT* \\- The bright citrus freshness in the top notes may lose its zesty impact, muting the fragrance's immediate vibrancy.\n***\n\n**2. Synthetic Musks**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Musk Xylene\n* Musk Ketone\n* Musk Ambrette\n\n**Alternatives:** Ambrettolide, Cashmeran\n\n**What Changed:**  \nRestrictions on synthetic musks promote the use of safer alternatives.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Chanel No. 5* \\- The iconic musky dry-down may lose its sensual depth, becoming cleaner and woodier.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Narciso Rodriguez for Her* \\- The plush, velvety musk might feel less enveloping, replaced by a more modern and airy quality.\n***\n\n**3. Oakmoss and Tree Moss**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Oakmoss (Evernia Prunastri)\n* Tree Moss (Evernia Furfuracea)\n* Atranol, Chloroatranol\n\n**What Changed:**  \nTighter restrictions on moss-derived allergens have led to increased reliance on synthetic substitutes.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Mitsouko* \\- The deep, mossy chypre base will lose some of its earthy richness.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Tom Ford Beau de Jour* \\- The green, mossy accords will feel less vibrant, with synthetic alternatives offering a cleaner profile.\n***\n\n**4. Iso-E Super**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Iso-E Super\n\n**What Changed:**  \nNew thresholds limit the use of this cornerstone of woody and amber notes.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Terre d’Hermes* \\- The woody-mineral dry-down will feel less pronounced, softening the fragrance's overall impact.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Escentric Molecules Molecule 01* \\- Reduced levels will make the scent less warm and smooth, affecting its minimalist charm.\n***\n\n**5. Aldehydes**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* C10 Aldehyde (Decanal)\n* C12 Aldehyde (Dodecanal)\n* C16 Aldehyde (Hexadecanal)\n* C18 Aldehyde (Octadecanal)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nStricter allergen limits have been introduced for aldehydes, which lend crispness and sparkle to fragrances.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Chanel No. 5* \\- The iconic soapy and powdery opening will feel softer and less effervescent.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Lancome La Vie Est Belle* \\- The fresh, clean aldehydic top notes will be dialled back, making the fragrance warmer and heavier.\n***\n\n**6. Phthalates**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Diethyl Phthalate (DEP)\n* Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP)\n* Dioctyl Phthalate (DOP)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nPhthalates, used as fixatives, face stricter regulations due to potential endocrine-disrupting effects.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Dior Poison* \\- Reduced fixatives may result in diminished lasting power and projection.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb* \\- Sweetness and warmth may become less intense, making the fragrance feel lighter.\n***\n\n**7. Coumarin**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Coumarin (Tonka bean extract)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nCoumarin restrictions aim to reduce allergenic risks.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Jicky* \\- The powdery, sweet tonka note will be less pronounced, resulting in a more herbal composition.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Armani Si* \\- The powdery sweetness will soften, making the fragrance feel drier.\n***\n\n**8. Cinnamaldehyde**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Cinnamaldehyde (Cinnamon extract)\n\n**What Changed:**  \nCinnamon’s spicy warmth is now more restricted due to its allergenic potential.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Estee Lauder Youth Dew* \\- The fragrance’s spicy intensity will soften.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Jo Malone Cinnamon and Tonka* \\- Cinnamon will feel less spicy, leaning towards a smoother profile.\n***\n\n**9. Geraniol and Citronellol**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Geraniol\n* Citronellol\n\n**What Changed:**  \nTighter thresholds aim to reduce allergenic reactions in floral fragrances.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Yves Saint Laurent Paris* \\- The rose note will become less vibrant.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Chloe Eau de Parfum* \\- The fresh floral opening may feel subtler.\n***\n\n**10. Benzyl Alcohol and Benzyl Salicylate**\n\n**Compounds Affected:**\n\n* Benzyl Alcohol\n* Benzyl Salicylate\n\n**What Changed:**  \nBoth are restricted to reduce allergenic risks.\n\n**Impact on Perfumes:**\n\n* **Classic Example:** *Guerlain Shalimar* \\- The powdery floral aspect will feel lighter.\n* **Contemporary Example:** *Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue* \\- The floral accords will diminish slightly.\n***\n\n**Commercial and Consumer Implications**\n\n**For Perfume Enthusiasts:**\n\n* Iconic fragrances may feel less familiar as reformulations result in lighter, less impactful experiences.\n* Vintage batches of popular fragrances may gain value due to perceptible differences.\n\n**For the Industry:**\n\n* Niche brands face greater challenges due to cost pressures and limited resources for R&D on synthetic alternatives.\n* Innovation in synthetic molecules will accelerate as brands strive to balance compliance with olfactory quality.\n\n**Winners:** Clean, minimalist fragrances that align with these regulatory changes.\n\n**Losers:** Classic, mossy chypres and musky orientals reliant on restricted ingredients.\n***\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe IFRA 51st Amendment continues to raise the bar for safety and sustainability in perfumery. However, its restrictions challenge brands to balance regulatory compliance with preserving olfactory artistry. As the fragrance landscape evolves, the industry is likely to witness a renaissance of synthetic innovation, while consumers adjust to a lighter, cleaner fragrance experience.\n***\n\n*I’ve tried to break this down to the best of my abilities and understanding. Apologies if I’ve overlooked or missed anything. The example of perfumes changing is just a hypothesis, if companies manage to find like-for-like alternatives, you wouldn’t notice the difference. However, that has never been the case in the past.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE** - The intent here is simply to inform you, please, I repeat, **DO NOT** take this as some alarmist message designed to pressure you into buying something you don’t need. Perfumes are not a necessity. If you don’t get that vintage 1940s batch of Guerlain Vetiver, life will go on, and nothing will change.\n",

From a perfume experience perspective, manufacturers may comply with limitations by reducing levels of certain ingredients or substituting them with alternatives to meet regulatory requirements. This might affect the perfume experience positively, negatively, or not at all. However, manufacturers will likely prioritize maintaining the user experience, even with necessary reformulations.\n\n3. What should consumers do—use newly reformulated perfumes or stick to older ones? In my view, safety should always take precedence over the perfume experience.",

    "body": "I am a hairdresser and have been doing Brazilian hair blow-drying in a salon for years. Evaporation of the product during blow-drying burns my eyes, my throat burns, sometimes I feel a burning sensation in my chest, I get headaches and sometimes migraines (I have had migraines for many years, but I noticed that I get them more often when I do more Brazilian treatments) , even some customers shed tears and have to keep their eyes closed while blow-drying. \n\n   \nI’ve never thought too much about the toxicity of the product, so I googled a bit and found a few articles that write about the dangers of the contents of Brazilian treatment products, so I decided to share with you some of the substances found in CHOCOCOCO  and their side effects: \n\n* **Stearic Acid** \\- Inhalation may cause chemical pneumonitis  \n* **Behentrimonium chloride**  is considered toxic in concentrations of 0.1% and above and is suspected to cause skin and eye irritation. \n* **Phenoxyethanol** is actually very harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin, especially for breastfeeding or infants, It can also have an effect on the brain and central nervous system. If you are exposed to the product several times a day, every day, it can accumulate and probably have a bad effect on you. The American Cancer Society warns that formaldehyde is a known carcinogen. This means it can cause cancer or help cancer grow. Formaldehyde can also trigger other side effects. May be toxic in concentrations of 1% or less. Tests show that keratin treatments contain unsafe levels of formaldehyde and other chemicals. The FDA has received dozens of product complaints. One hairdresser, for example, said her treatments caused her migraines, blurred vision, sore throat, nausea and loss of smell. \n* **Glycolic acid**  shows some inhalation toxicity and can cause damage to the respiratory system, thymus and liver if they are present at very high levels over a long period of time. \n* **Coumarin**  is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys. \n* **Benzyl benzoate** side effects: irritations of the skin, eyes, nose and throat that can cause severe symptoms such as burning, nausea, vomiting and damage to the liver and kidneys. \n\n Some manufacturers claim that their keratin treatment does not contain **formaldehyde**, although there are studies that state the opposite. \n\nI would just like to briefly explain the process of Brazilian blow-drying for those who do not know: \n\n1. Hair is washed with a special shampoo (from the manufacturer, of course) \n2. The product is applied to dry hair, after 20 min it is blow-dried  \n3. Blow-drying causes a strong and visible evaporation of the product, the steam of which goes straight into my face (after blow-drying, the whole salon stinks of it, and is in the fog)  \n4. Hair is ironed at 220'C (which causes evaporation, but not in such quantities)  \n5. After the treatment, the hair is washed with special shampoos (Again, from the manufacturer, of course) \n\nI just want to state that I am not a chemist nor am I knowledgeable in chemistry in any way so I hope if someone is educated in this field I would be grateful if you would leave an opinion, also I do not know the percentage of these substances because their website does not state it.  \n\nHere is a list of all the ingredients in their product: \n\n Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Keratin / Hydrolysed Keratin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark / Leaf / Twig Extract, Calendula Officinalis (Marigold) Flower Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Behentrimonium Chloride, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii, Shea Butothera Evening Primrose) Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Salt), Dehydroacetic Acid, Aloe (Vera) Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Squalane, Ascorbic Acid Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Fragrance, Retinyl Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Glycolic Acid, Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate  \n\nThanks for reading and I will be grateful for any information and opinions <3",

        "body": "Hmm looking at that ingredients list I have to say it looks very innocent imo! I would have expected to see some hard core stuff in such product. Looking at Kerastase and Redken ingredients lists are generally way more frightening. I can’t see any really nasty things in the list- the nastiest ones are Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha- isomethyl ionone and benzoyl salicylate. These are fragrances that are more allergenic than when the list just says fragrance or perfume ( the manufacturer has to write the most allergenic fragrances separately in the list). But again- all of these will be found in almost any salon hair products with fragrance- and in a lot of “ natural” products as well. Phenoxyethanol is in basically every product you buy for hair, body or face. It acts as a stabilizer or as a preservative in products and became highly popular when parabens got unpopular. It is generally considered safe in small concentrations ( under 1%) for adults. It’s not considered safe for children under age 3 and should not be used if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. It has nothing to do with Formaldehyde as far as I know. Again- phenoxyethanol is in almost any product, even in the most sensitive no perfume no color brands. If you have to avoid it I think you would be limited to raw oils and the baby products.\nOverall I think that the list looks very descent. With some quite good stuff in it as well.\nAlso FYI I’m not educated in this, so I’m by no means an expert- it’s just a weird hobby😅\n\nEdit: I would also recommend wearing a mask and glasses when using. It looks safe when applying normally to hair but it’s not meant to be inhaled/ go in the eyes of course.",

        "body": "While you’re not wrong that the traditional Brazilian blowout is very toxic and releases formaldehyde when heat is applied to the hair the initial time at the salon, I am not reading anything specifically in those ingredients you listed that would cause this process. Glycolic acid would be suspected if it were high on the list, because glyxolic acid and ingredients with similar names may consist of one of the first ingredients in a “new and improved” Brazilian blowout (which still releases formaldehyde, they tend to just be sneakier about their product claims). The ingredient list you posted doesn’t have those ingredients, from what I can tell (but hey, I’m not a chemist, so if anyone is an expert in that field, please chime in). \n\nBehentrimonium chloride is an extremely popular ingredient in many hair conditioners, both drugstore branded and professional. I haven’t heard any recent research regarding controversy with the ingredient, but it very well could only be toxic under certain circumstances of which I can’t attest to (such as applying heat and keratin with it). \n\nThe first ingredient is water, the next is a harmless emulsifier (which allows the cream to keep it from separating), the third ingredient is an animal protein that comes from animal hair/hooves/horns. It’s not a scary ingredient, it’s just a cheap protein compared to keratin. Then keratin, followed by a lot of essential oils (which I wouldn’t be surprised if they were the culprit here). Fragrances, especially ones as volatile as essential oils, *especially* when you mix a buttload of them, generally do not play well with being heated against the hair at 450F. The rest of the ingredients are comprised of ingredients that make up less than ~1%, like tiny fragrance ingredients (linalool, limonine), and preservatives to keep it from spoilage (benzyl salicylate). \n\nI would definitely discontinue that brand, especially because unless there are extra ingredients/steps in the treatment aside from that ingredient list, I’m not sure I understand how they are meant to last for 3-6 months on anyone. None of the ingredients to form any sort of lasting keratin bond to the hair appear to be in that ingredient list, and the ones that could potentially play any role are in such minutes qualities to almost be meaningless. The glycolic acid being near the end of the ingredient list suggests it’s much more likely that it was a minor pH adjustment to the formula, not any life-changing chemical reaction. It seems as if your salon is getting ripped off by whoever is promoting their line of keratin treatments to you. The Cezanne line is one of the better ingredient lists out there, but I’ve only been doing a deep dive (as a current stylist) on this treatment since right before I did one on myself. I did the long lasting Cezanne treatment and there is absolutely no smell at any point in the process. You just have to make sure when you rinse the product, you don’t rinse too much of it out before you pat-dry and blow dry or there won’t be enough keratin still on the hair to bond correctly.",

And the oils are different. Rare Beauty uses jojoba and Sunflower oils. ETUDE uses Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Apricot Oil, Evening Primrose Oil and Sweet Almond Oil. Rare Beauty also uses Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, and Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract. While Etude just uses Mango Fruit Extract.\n\nHave you seen this before, where a company dupes another company's formula and then charges more for it?",

I'd rather have an inclusive shade range that's easier for me to purchase, even at a higher price. \n\nAlso I don't see how this etude house tint is any different to romand's juicy lasting tint, or glasting tint, or any tint that has a glassy finish. Yeah, rare beauty does have a lot of aesthetics taken from k-beauty but like everyone else is saying, it's probably not exactly the same. Not everything is meant to be a dupe.\n\nEdit: also most korean lip tints dry down, and do not feel like lip oils at all.

It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.

This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

    "body": "Welcome all you brave souls to Tabacotober, a celebration of the most divisive soap in wetshaving history. Love it or [hate it](https://i.imgur.com/u6zRBs0.jpg), Tabac will always have it's own niche among the classics and the artisans. In recent years, Tabac made the seemingly inevitable shift to a tallow-free formula, following along the same path as many EU (and formerly EU) brands before it. What does that mean for you, the lowly wetshaver?\n\n\nWell, to paraphrase a great wetshaver (probably), \"if you want to make a good review about soap, you must first invent the soap,\" or something. This is far from the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wetshaving/comments/f2hr9y/_/fhcm5sx) time I've covered the topic, but in it’s simplest terms, **soap is a salt**. The chemical reaction of the saponification process takes a weak fatty acid and a strong base such as lye, and water. Through the magic of chemistry we now have potassium and/or sodium salts, aka soap.\n\n\nSo let's take a look at the star of the show this month, [Tabac](https://i.imgur.com/bFyzqzv.jpg).\n\n\nThe Ingredient | Why it's included\n:--|:--:\nPotassium Stearate | is the potassium salt of stearic acid used primarily as an emulsifying agent.\nSodium Stearate | is the sodium salt of stearic acid. A primary component of soap which does the soap things, like encapsulating dirt so it can be washed away.\nPotassium Laurate | Skin cleansing compound containing fatty acid potassium.\nSodium Laurate | a detergent. The sodium salt of lauric acid (see below)\nGlycerin | a humectant used to help prevent skin moisture loss. Remember, soap is a salt, and salts draw out water.\nAqua | dihydrogen monoxide. Dangerous stuff.\nParfum | made of various aldehydes, esters, terpines etc. These are covered individually below, thanks to EU guidelines we actually get to know the exact compounds used, unlike US artisans who keep the names of their Brambleberry bulk preblend oil purchases to themselves.\nLauric Acid | A fatty acid chain, one of the components of the actual soap.\nLimonene | a multipurpose hydrocarbon functions both as as cleaning assistant which helps other cleaning agents to penetrate the skin and as a citrusy scent. Probably moreso the latter in this case.\nLinalool | A terpine from many plants, likely supporting a lavender note for Tabac.\nHydroxycitronellal | A medium chain aldehyde, a scent component. Interestingly identified in the EU as a known potential skin irritant.\nCI 77891 | aka titanium dioxide, a common white pigment, it's probably in a majority of your products.\nIsoeugenol | A scent component. A main scent in citronella.\nPentasodium Pentetate | A salt, a chelating agent, inactivates metallic ions. It's a preservative.\nTetrasodium Etidronate | aka tatrasodium EDTA. A preservative. Potentially harmful to the skins barrier, however not well absorbed, requires formaldehyde and cyanide to create.\nCitronellol | A perfume ingredient, safe at appropriate levels. Also an insecticide (citronella).\nCoumarin | [LITERALLY RAT POISON](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/diesa1/what_fragrances_would_you_like_to_see_reviewed/f3w636s?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)\nBenzyl Alcohol | a solvent. Probably the base for the perfume. Don't drink this.\nAlpha-Isomethyl Ionone | A synthetic violet scent compound made from brewers yeast.\nGeraniol | A scent component, also an insecticide (citronella).\nBenzyl Salicylate | A fragrance additive, sweet and balsamic.\nCinnamyl Alcohol | A fragrance ester, sweet balsamic and hyacinth.\nCitral | A fragrance aldehyde, lemony.\nEugenol | aka clove oil. Do you need more of an explanation?\n\n\n\nThis seems like a decently sized ingredient list. This is mostly due to the EU regulations requiring individual scent components to be listed, instead of just “perfume” which we commonly see in Made In USA products. So let's take out the perfume ingredients, coloring agents, and preservatives. We are left with;\n\n* Potassium Stearate\n* Sodium Stearate\n* Potassium Laurate\n* Sodium Laurate\n* Glycerin\n* Aqua\n* Lauric Acid\n\n\nThis is it. This is the real backbone of Tabac. Seven ingredients in Tabac that give us actual soap. “But where’s the palm/coconut/castor/safflower/whatever-veggie oil?” Instead of listing the reactants, this list instead shows us the products of the saponification reaction. These products being the two stearates and two laurates. Since we have both sodium and potassiums versions, I understand this means this formula uses two lyes in the saponification process, which is more common among artisan soaps than mass production soaps. We also have glycerin and lauric acid which may either be byproducts of saponification, additives, or most likely, both. The glycerin and lauric acid likely help to soften the blow of the drying quality of the soaps.\n\n\nSo that’s it, breaking it down, Tabac is a bare-bones duel lye soap formula without *any* additional moisturizers, vitamins, lanolin, or any of the other “skin foods” we commonly associate with good quality, skin happy shaving software. Do we even need all these extra additives? Are we convincing ourselves into equating a basic soap formula as lesser/equal/better than an artisan formula? If Tabac gives you quality shaves, then why not another old classic [Mama Bear?](https://mamabearssoaps.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=1&zenid=vpgklr21aip9h31copu8p07b35).",

        "body": "A shorter breakdown of the ingredients, putting them into soapmaking context:\n\n**Potassium Stearate / Sodium Stearate / Potassium Laurate / Sodium Laurate / Lauric Acid / Aqua:**  \nThis is the soap part.  It's what results from mixing stearic acid and lauric acid with lye (sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide) dissolved in water.  The stearic part of the soap makes creamy lather that's mildly cleansing; the lauric part of the soap makes fast bubbly lather that's very cleansing and can be harsh at high concentrations.\n\n**Glycerin:**  \nIf you make soap from complete fats (triglycerides - molecules built from three fatty acids linked with a glycerin subcomponent), glycerin is a natural byproduct of the saponification process.  This recipe uses pure fatty acids rather than complete triglycerides and thus creates no glycerin on its own.  Hence they add glycerin as a separate ingredient, because *in the context of shave soap* glycerin helps the lather hold water and become gloopy and slick without just collapsing as soon as it gets outside a narrow range of acceptable hydration levels.  Soaps without enough glycerin are real dang hard to lather well.  (See: MWF.)\n\n**Pentasodium Pentetate / Tetrasodium Etidronate:**  \nChelating agents to make the soap easier to lather in hard water.\n\n**CI 77891:**  \nColor.\n\n**Everything Else:**  \nFragrance / specific aromachemicals present in the Fragrance recipe that require disclosure under EU laws.",

    "body": "[The Tobacco Throwdown Round 7 - Maurer & Wirtz Tabac Original](http://imgur.com/gallery/0i4MyQ5)\n\n\n* **Brush:** Turn N Shave Barberpole\n\n* **Razor:** Charcoal Tech\n\n* **Blade:** Gilette Silver Blue\n\n* **Lather:** Tabac Orignal\n\n* **Post:** Stirling Shave Balm Unscented\n\nWhen my interest in tobacco scented soaps began I started to hear rumblings from the corners of the internet about a legendary tobacco scent of yore. A soap that would seperate boys from men, and a must try for anyone claiming to love tobacco scents. I am of course referring to the OG tobacco shaving soap out of Germany, the infamous *Tabac Original*.\n\n\nFounded in 1845 in Stolberg Germany Maurer & Wirtz soapworks is certainly the lingest running company that will be featured in the tobacco throwdown. 114 years later in 1959 Maurer & Wirtz began producing *Tabac Orignal* shaving soap. The soap has become a staple in the wetshving community known for its good performance and divisive fragrance.\n\nTabac Original comes standard in a heavy ceramic bowl with a wooden lid, branded with the retro and clean Tabac logo. It is  nice solid presentation, but nothing fancy. Tabac is also available in refill pucks which is what I have obtained for this review.  \n\nTabac is an old fashioned barbershopish scent with lots of florals and musks.  Unlike the rest of the soaps I have reviewed in this series Tabac is based on the scent of the Tobacco Flower as opposed to a cured tobacco leaf. Really this is comparing apples to oranges, but I did not feel that this reveiw series would be complete if Tabac were excluded.\n\nThe scent notes listed for Tabac Orignal are :  \n\n*Pepper, Petitgrain, Citrus & Neroli.*\n\n*Lavander, Camomie, Geranium & Oak Moss.*\n\n*Carnation. Sandalwood, Vetiver, Moschus(musks) & Ambergris*\n\nTobacco is conspicuously absent from the list but I did find it listed some places and exlcuded others. I ended up using the listed scent from the Tabac website.\n\nTabac is a smooth, leathery and powdery scent. I get bits of pepper and the underlying astringency of citrus that leads into a soapy air of lavender, but a light one that does not sparkle as much in Tabac as in many other scents.  The lavender leads into a strong heart of vetiver supported by sandalwood and musks with just a touch of distinctive ambergris to close things out. There are no distinct tobacco scents, but I can see Echoes of other tobacco flower fragrances I have used. I did not obtain the Tabac aftershave or Edt for this review and I have read conflicting reports as to whether or not those products maintain the same scent profile.\n\nWhile Tabac was introduced in 1959 its scent feels like it belongs more in the period of Mauer & Wirtz's founding, the mid 1800s. This is an extremely old fashioned and masculine fragrance. If the Full Measure of Man is a scent that makes me feel old and distingued, Tabac just makes me feel old and dessicated. It's a soapy scent that manages to not quite feel clean. I think a lot of that comes from the musks which just do not agree with my sensibilities.\n\nI am sure that this is a controversial take. After all several people here on reddit recommended this soap to me. But Tabac just does not connect for me.\n\nWhile I am not a fan of the scent of Tabac performance is definitely where this soap shines. Tabac is another hard puck soap like Pre de Provence No. 63, but Tabac has much better performance. The listed ingredients for Tabac Orignal are: *Potassium Stearate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Sodium Tallowate, Parfum, Sodium Cocoate, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Sodium Hydroxide, CI 77891, Limonene, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Coumarin, AlphaIsomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Geraniol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Isoeugenol, Benzyl Alcohol, Citral, Eugenol*\n\nTabac being a hard-pucked soap should last basically forever. I find that scooping a small chunk and blooming it in my lather bowl provides the best results, and I would think blooming is even more important for those who choose to brush load.  Tabac quickly works up into a thick creamy lather with great slickeness and cushion and plenty of residual slickness to touch up any trouble areas with no  need to reapply lather. Post shave feel os solid but nothing too special. I do not know if this is the original formulation of the Tabac shaving soap, but if so I am thoroughly impressed. Tabac provides the best performance of a mass market shave soap that I have tried so far. I would rate this soap as similar to Chiseled Face and Oleo Canard bases for performance.  \n\n\nWhile the rugged and Original scent of Tabac may not be a crowd pleaser the solid and consistent performance of the soap itself should be. There is a reason Tabac is so oft lauded across shaving forums large and small: this is a solid soap that lead the curve i  performance long before the advent of the modern artisinal market.\n\nWhile Tabac is a must try for every Tobacco lover (if only to say they have tried it) and a good recommendation for fans of traditional barbershops it just cannot keep up with the stiff competition from the rest of the Throwdown. Overall Id rate Tabac as dead last, 8/8 of the soaps I have reviewed so far.  It is a dated scent and does not present itself with nearly the same refinement as TFMoM the other 'old-man' scent I have reviewed for this series. Tabac does brings neither sweetness or spice, either of the things I love so much in so many tobacco scents.\n\nAs of week 8 the standings for the Tobacco Throwdown are:\n\n* [#1.

In contrast to DR Harris, Tabac has zero propensity to froth if loaded with a brush that's too wet.  I'm guessing that the high proportion of K-salts and the bias towards \"heavier\" fats (stearic and tallow over coconut oil) are the main reasons.\n\nAlso notable: Tabac is available in what is probably the most ergonomic shave stick in existence.

It's so expensive! However, I'm happy to report: I am in love.\r\n\r\n**Description from Lush:**\r\n\r\n\"Where would we be without love? Envelop yourself in a warm embrace of romantic rose and the comforting touch of sandalwood.\"\r\n\r\n**Ingredients**\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\nOrganic Alcohol Denat., Perfume, Water (Aqua), Glycerine, Labdanum Resinoid, Rose Absolute, Sandalwood Oil, Tonka Absolute, Benzoin Resinoid, Benzyl Alcohol, *Benzyl Benzoate, *Benzyl Cinnamate, Benzyl Salicylate, *Cinnamal, *Citral, *Citronellol, Coumarin, *Eugenol, *Farnesol, Geraniol, *Isoeugenol, *Limonene, *Linalool\r\n\r\n**Scent**\r\n\r\nWhat stands out to me is sandalwood & tonka. Yoga Bomb comes to mind, although that is just one element of this complex fragrance. \r\n\r\nThere is a natural sweetness to it that reminds me a bit of how it smells at the garden centre. A very small touch of green freshness similar to Sakura. Slightly piney maybe? \r\n\r\nThe third note that I pick up is Rose Jam-like sweet floral, with a touch of citrus. However, it is in the background. So this is not a citrus-heavy scent, in my opinion. I'm grateful for that, because (even though I like citrus), there are enough options for that at Lush already.\r\n\r\nSo Yoga Bomb meets Sakura meets Rose Jam. (In my humble opinion)\r\n\r\n**Longevity**\r\n\r\nHappy to report it lasts all day on my skin & clothes. Nice change from what I've experienced with their fragrances lately (LOM body spray seems very weak?).\r\n\r\n**Final thoughts**\r\n\r\nSo. Does this perfume fit in with the Christmas theme? Yes... It's floral, green and woody at the same time. If you liked Shade, you'll probably like this too. I really hope they make this available to purchase separately from the Advent Calendar.\r\n\r\nBut if you were looking for a gourmand fragrance (baked goods, ginger, coffee, vanilla sweetness) for Christmas, it is not that. You might like Turmeric Latte or LTGTR better in that case.\r\n\r\nFor all Dutch redditors out here: this smells exactly like how it smells at the Coppelmans garden centre around Christmas time, when they have all the decorations out!",

    "body": "Last week, I got some cosmetics from a department store and they included some Le Labo samples, one of which was Baie 19. After smelling it, it smelled almost identical to an accord I made about six months ago, right down to the number of ingredients. (Although my understanding is the numbers in Le Labo's names are more marketing than facts). The accord was intended to evoke \"walking outside after a rain\":  \n\n|Ingredient|Amount|\n:--|--:|\n|ISO E Super|225|\n|Cedramber|225|\n|Hedione|225|\n|Exaltolide|100|\n|Dihydromyrcenol|75|\n|Benzyl Salicylate|40|\n|Patchouli|20|\n|Cashmeran|20|\n|Undecavertol|20|\n|Ambrox|10|\n|Vetiveryl Acetate|10|\n|Benzaldehyde|10|\n|Heliotropine|10|\n|Allyl Amyl Glycolate|3|\n|Geosmin 10%|2|\n|IBQ|2|\n|Safranal|1|\n|Safraleine|1|\n|Floralozone|1​|\n\n \n\nHere's Le Labo's description:  \n\n\n\"Truth is…Baie 19 should have been called Water 19. Not that it smells like nothing (though nothing smells like it), but it has this crisp, wet, drenched effect that water gives to the earth after the rain...And there’s a word for that, by the way: petrichor. It’s that magical feeling during heavy rain after a long dry spell, and it’s one of the most beautiful olfactive phenomena in nature. There are many reasons for this, including the ozone in the air, the negative ions, but most importantly the release of oil secretions from certain plants, accumulated after a long dry period. This is what Baie 19 is about: the dry juniper berry , the patchouli, the green leaves... all soaked by a beautiful, luminous, magnetic rain after a long drought. And the joy that comes with it…\"",

    "body": "I have short wavy to curly hair that generally gets very frizzy. It is dry, with normal scalp. I have a lot (A LOT) of really thick hair. It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product? My wallet and I thank you in advance.**",

    "body": "There have been a lot of posts recently in which people have talked about the differences between ingredients and and notes.  I think that many people still underestimate just how much of the notes listings are approximations and “marketing speak” so I’ve decided to offer a little illustration.\n\nWe can break down fragrances using a tool called a GCMS (a Gas Chromatograph with a Mass Spectrometer attached).  The specifics of how it works is outside the scope of this post, but it basically breaks down a sample into its ingredients and measures the relative amounts of each.  It’s not 100% accurate because some ingredients can influence the smell of a fragrance even an very small concentrations (like pyrazines) so the best thing to do is to modify it so that you can have someone with a trained nose sniffing each of the batches of ingredients as they’re expelled as gas to see if the GCMS missed anything.  Also, it’ll break down natural oils into their component parts, so lavender oil would be read as “linalool, linalyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol, camphor, nerol,\" etc\n\nAnyway, we now have the ability to break down fragrances and look at what makes them tick. So, let’s look at one, a designer fragrance with lots of notes listed (and yes, I did pick one that highlights my point particularly well).\n\n[Eternity for Women](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Calvin-Klein/Eternity-257.html)\n\nLook at all those notes!  Lily and carnation and violet and sandalwood, not to mention citrus and freesia and jasmine and amber and…well, there are a lot listed.\n\n[Now lets look at a GCMS readout of Eternity…in German, but that doesn’t really matter](http://perfume.twoday.net/stories/eternity/).\n\nThe numbers next to the ingredients do matter.  They give the relative amounts of each.  There’s a big block (15%) that is listed as unidentified/solvent and there are probably some useful things in there too.  Patchouli is listed as a note, for example, and if real patchouli was used (which seems likely since it’s very inexpensive), patchouli is made up of hundreds or ingredients, many of which are unlikely to show up in the MS’s database or occur in very small amounts.\n\nAnyway though, I’m going to give you a general idea of where the notes came from.\n\n*  **Carnation** -  The “carnation” in here comes from what’s called the Melis accord, a combination of benzyl salicylate and eugenol.  The ratio is traditionally  4.5:1.  It’s a bit off here, but then there are other salicylates and isoeugenol as well.  It’s certainly a riff on the Melis accord.  Salicylates and eugenol are responsible in part for the smell of natural carnations, so the Melis accord gets listed as a carnation note\n\n* **Lily** - The lily notes mostly come from a combination of a 3 ingredients lilial, hydroxycitronellal and lyral, all aldehydes.  Lilial is a watery lily smell that is often grouped with aquatics.  The other two are the go-to chemicals when one is trying to create a lily smell.  Both are pretty heavily restricted now. That little bit of phenethyl alcohol also contributes to the lily smell, as do all the various linalools.\n\n* **Violet flower** - See the beta ionone? See the alpha ionone? Those makes up most of that violet note.  It’s important to note that a lot of flowers (or reconstructions of flowers) share a lot of ingredients, so many of these ingredients are pulling double, triple, even quadruple duty.  The linalool and the terpenes are helpful for the violet smell for example…but if none of those were in here, they’d still have listed violet in the notes\n\n* **Freesia** - A simple freesia reconstitution comes from linalool (mostly, like 80% of the freesia smell is from linalool), beta ionone (also used for violet AND sandalwood) and alpha terpenol. Bam! Freesia.  Note that so far, 3 of the 4 flowers in this composition don’t have natural oils available because we haven’t figured out how to extract the smell in any reasonable way.\n\n* **Jasmine** - This comes from the benzyl acetate and hedione mostly, combined with some of the other ingredients that are common to a bunch of other flowers.  This is a common theme here.  There are a bunch of ingredients that are \"shared\" amongst notes.\n\n* **Heliotrope** -  This comes from the heliotropin, the heliotropyl diethyl acetal and some of the other shared floral ingredients.\n\n* **Amber** - Vanillin + Ambrettolide (a somewhat animalic musk that naturally occurs in ambrette seeds) + some citruslike chemicals = a very basic ambrene. Iso E Super also has some amber-like qualities\n\n* **Musk** -  Galaxolide (one of the most commonly used white musks) and Ambrettlolide\n\n* **Sandalwood** - This comes from the sandranol (a synthetic sandalwood like ingredient) and possibly a bit of the vanillin and beta ionone and maybe a touch of the iso e super depending on the isomer ratio.\n\n* **Rose** - Phenethyl alcohol and citronellol makes for a reasonable rosy smell.\n\nI could go on, but I don’t have time.  In reality, most of the absolutes for these ingredients would have dozens of ingredients.  In this composition, they’re just painted with broad strokes using one or two unique compounds and a pool of shared ingredients.  Frankly, I doubt that Sophia Grojsman was planning on putting in all of these flowers. She was likely just mixing together floral ingredients in a pleasing way and then people went back and figured out what notes to list. Some were obviously deliberate.  The heliotrope and the carnation and the sandalwood for example, but others probably were not, or were afterthoughts like “oh!  I bet a touch of rosiness would be nice” and then the rosiness was added with phenethyl alcohol and citronellol. \n\nThis does a really good job of showing a modern composition and how notes are mapped to it.\n\nI’m a big proponent of learning notes by smelling the actual ingredients and here’s an example of why.  Imagine trying to learn the violet note when all the fragrances with “violet” listed are really just one or two violet-like chemicals…and possibly different ones.  The violet note here is from alpha and beta ionone.  In Tresor it’s from methyl ionone. In another fragrance it might be a 30 ingredient violet reconstruction.\n\nAnd this is why notes in modern fragrances can’t be trusted.",

    "body": "About my hair- 2a/2b dry coarse low porosity hair which is a little longer than my waist.\nI have always had a tough time finding a conditioner / mask , any mask loaded with silicones make my hair not clump to form waves and puff out. Matrix hydrasource mask was the only thing that has even come close to my hg but unfortunately they stopped selling the mask on retail basis and it is intended only for saloon purpose and with the pandemic I don't think I will be stepping into a salon anytime soon. So I was looking for an affordable alternative and someone in this sub mentioned this one. Now the coming to ingredients \n\nMatrix biolage hydrasource mask- \nAqua , Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, stearyl alcohol,Cetyl Esters, fragrance,  Phenoxyethanol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis / Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride , sodium citrate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Linalool, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxycitronellal, Amyl Cinnamal. \n\n Loreal total repair 5 masque - \nWater, cetearyl alcohol, mineral oil, dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylmonium methosulphate, cetyl esters, lactic acid, phenoxyethanol , trideceth-6 , chlorhexidine digluconate, limonene, benzyl salicylate, amodimethacone, 2-oleamido-1,3-octadecanediol, fragrance,cetrimonium chloride, butylphenyl methylpropional , Hexyl cinnamal.(they have reformulated since the last time I used it about 2 years ago)\n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\n     Now coming to texture , the loreal one is tad bit thicker than the matrix mask and the slip provided is also lesser than the matrix mask. So I needed about 1.5 times  the amount as matrix one . The shine provided by both are same .They both act similarly when it come to making my waves form and hold. The loreal one is not as moisturising as the Matrix mask , and the frizz is also a little more than matrix mask.  So overall I would say  loreal total repair mask comes close to matrix by about 85%  . And it is costlier than the matrix biolage hydrasource mask, so I will again start my search once this one gets over.",

Whatever is very faint...\n\nAnd while these days I don't get the body wash because I want to avoid plastic where I can when I can, the body cream: **yes.** It has 10% of a complex that includes both lactic acid and urea, and on the inci I read it also has retinol:\n\n*Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum Mineral Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-100 Stearate, Dimethicone, Urea, Sodium Lactate, Lecithin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Rosa Moschata Seed Oil, Zea Mays Oil, Calcium Pantothenate, Inositol, Retinol, Biotin, PEG-20 Castor Oil, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Alcohol Denat, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower ) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Parfum (Fragrance), Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citral, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glycine, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Citrate*\n\nI have KP and this does help keep my skin smoother. Smells really nice too, kinda sweet powdery, but it doesn't linger. I hate HATE body creams and just that sensation of stickyness and this doesn't leave that.\n\nBest thing is the price point, I get this Amazon or Walmart for the equivalent of $4.11usd, the brand is Spanish, and for those of you in the US you can get it on Amazon for $10usd. It's 400ml, yes the bottle is bigger so it comes half empty, but it is 400ml because I have weighted it.\n\nFor those in MX this is $78pesos <3.  \n\n\nAMAZON MX: [https://www.amazon.com.mx/Lactovit-95350477-Crema-Nutrireparadora-Lactourea/dp/B006A5KF4A/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?\\_\\_mk\\_es\\_MX=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=331TDTNDH6BA6&keywords=lactovit&qid=1675718747&sprefix=lactovit%2Caps%2C129&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Lactovit-95350477-Crema-Nutrireparadora-Lactourea/dp/B006A5KF4A/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_MX=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=331TDTNDH6BA6&keywords=lactovit&qid=1675718747&sprefix=lactovit%2Caps%2C129&sr=8-1) \n\nedit: I changed the link cause I don't know what the heck is that fake bot.

Future releases will be labelled 26.1, 26.2, 26.3 etc. \n\n200 ISO E Super\n\n200 Ethylene Brassylate\n\n100 Texas Cedarwood Oil\n\n75 Hedione\n\n75 Benzyl Benzoate\n\n60 Helional\n\n50 Sandelore\n\n40 Undecavertol\n\n30 Cashmeran\n\n30 Beta Ionone\n\n25 Cedryl Acetate\n\n25 Lilial\n\n20 Exaltolide\n\n20 Methyl Ionone\n\n20 Coumarin (Crystal)\n\n20 Lyral\n\n4 Aldehyde C-12 (Lauric)\n\n4 Aldehyde C-11\n\n2 Aldehyde C-18 (Coconut Lactone)\n\nNOTES: \n\n* Use 10% fragrance ratio to wax.\n* The next release, I plan to focus on tweaking the woody aspects of this, possibly replacing some or all of the Cedarwood with a combination of Vertofix, Vertinex and Cedramber. The hot throw smells exceptionally close to Santal 26, but the cold throw smells a bit too acrid-woody. \n* I may also incorporate Ambrox into the next release and adjust the aldehydes.\n* Note that this is a recreation of the candle, not the room spray.  There are some subtle notes in the spray that don't really come across in the candle. If you feel inclined to experiment though and turn this into a room spray, I would look at adding Farnesol, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Linalool, Citral, Eugenol, Isoeugenol, Ambrox, Methyl Laitone (instead of Coconut Lactone), Geraniol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, and Hexyl Cinnamyl. And increase the ISO E Super content to 50-55%.",

    "body": "(Pc:Tried)\n\n#These are only first impressions & may not cover the fragrance in entirety. \n\nThis is a part of a massive haul, I realised they both are Elixirs, so I tried to feature them together. These are blind buys, scooped a fantastic deal on Parcos & Myntra, skipping the deal almost felt impossible. BB Elixir is from Myntra & you know how unappealing Myntra packaging is, so just for photography purposes, I have’em in the same box. \n\nConsidering how potent they are portrayed on the internet, I opted for 50ml versions & I’m glad they are 50ml 🤦🏻‍♂️.\n\n#⭕️Hugo Boss — Bottled Elixir\n\n👉🏻 Before anything else, I like Balsamic notes, Incense notes & few dark & resinous notes. I orient the name Elixir with **“highest quality”** , **“highly concentrated”** & **“Dense & creamy”** . When I smelled this, it was none of that. The quality is better than most designers, I should say that. But there are many higher quality fragrances available. The opening is good, **Frankincense & Cardamom**, they carry this fragrance’s ideology very well. The dry down is where I have a problem with. It develops a weird designer-ish tones. I can clearly understand where this is going & what its trying to be. \n\n👉🏻They want this to have a labdanum & Benzoin based balsamic dry down, but its cost cutting or whatever Hugo made. It smells more synthetic & I suspect it mostly **ambroxan & Benzyl salicylate** . This is not dense as I expected. For me it feels like something Lacoste would do. (Not shitting on Lacoste by any means, I’m just acknowledging the idea that, it would fit right in their l’homme line).\n\n👉🏻Performance is truly something else, that I should give credit to. But I just find this too synthetic for my taste, that’s all. Its just **my palate of preference** . Otherwise I won’t complain about the fragrance. Its very mass appealing, in case you are new to dark fragrances & wanna try a safer option pick this one. \n\n\n#⭕️Invictus Victory Elixir \n\n👉🏻I have the **“Paco Rabanne”** version, lately they rebranded it & altered the logo & calling it **“Rabanne”** . That’s a discussion for another day. But I like how pretentious **“Paco rabanne”** sounds, I’m gonna miss it. 😔😔😔\n\n###The atomizer is as shitty as ever, I love it. \n\n###The bottle design is as pretentious as ever, I love it.\n\n###The fragrance is as synthetic as ever & I weirdly like it. \n\n👉🏻The reviews about this being **vanilla bomb** & all the sunshines & rainbow, throw it in the garbage. This is a bougie version of Invictus OG & Victory. It still retains that **bubblegummy** nature but toned down, I wonder why nobody mentions that in their reviews. \n\n👉🏻Yes, it has that vanilla, its much smoother & very mass appealing. This is not in my palate of preference as well. But I would definitely pick this over the other invictus flankers, period. The performance is insane & I feel like two sprays are a mistake. \n\n#💢Initial Verdict \n\n 🎖️These are both mass appealing, slightly darker & more bolder releases. But I find them little too synthetic for my liking. **It just means I’m not fond of them, not in any way I’m saying that the fragrance smells bad** . Even tho IV Elixir is more synthetic than BB Elixir, I like it more. It just solidifies the fact that, **synthetic doesn’t mean bad / cheap**. \n\n*(People believing in that predisposing notion, this is a good example)* \n\n🎖️ I’m more than satisfied with both of their performance. However its too early to say anything, I reserve my other observations & analysis for the final comprehensive review. \n\n🎖️ I will give these a week’s worth if wearing & give my final thoughts. Right now, I’m not a fan of’em & I can clearly see there is also a **strong possibility that they will grow on me** , considering their scent profile. \n\nIf you guys want a detailed comprehensive review, please let me know. These are just first impressions & it may not do justice to any fragrances. So take these with a bucket of salt. ",

    "body": "This is a long-overdue post on a Liberty haul I got about a year ago that included various floral absolutes I had never smelled. Today looking at Mimosa, Frangipani, Osmanthus, and Yellow Champaca. Most of this is just several cleaned up stream-of-consciousness notes I took during the first few rounds of sniffs and was too anxious to post about. Looking forward to hearing others' experiences with these materials, your thoughts on their odor profiles, their place in formulae, etc.\n\n**Mimosa:** This came as dark yellow, hard fragrant chunks. It is airy, pretty, softly sweet, green/grassy/coumarinic, with a slight orange blossom thing going on and a touch of banana peel. It reminds me of some smell from my youth I can't quite place, like some kind of European candy, but also I get flashes from being outside during daycare, where I may have just literally been smelling mimosa on the wind.\n\nCould do well in a clean laundry or marine type, or a fougere, or perhaps paired with orris/ionones.\n\nIt refuses to dissolve completely at 10% in ethanol, which, being definitionally alcohol-soluble as an absolute, is maddening. What looks like 40% of my bottle is particulate hanging out at the bottom. Should have gone 5% but it was the first of the bunch that I diluted and it's pretty cheap so I had comparatively more of it. With the amount of particulate at 10%, I doubt it will fair much better at 5%.\n\n**Frangipani:** This is a gooey but clumpy brown paste, pretty easy to work with. Extremely beautiful and regal. Big, thick floral, Jasmine type with a Ylang-like quasi-banana thing. Slight touch of sweetness. Sub out jasmine or ylang for this and it could be magic. At first this wasn't a world I wanted to expore, but the longer I smell it, the more it grows on me. Kind of an overgrown flower garden vibe. Almost a hint of peppermint? Slap a load of stemone on it and dress it up in some greenery? Sandalwood and rose? Could also be cool with karmawood or another dry amber. \n\nI'm using this now at \\~10% of a formula with Blue Cypress EO, Rose Givco, and the Fraterworks Lindenblossom base, with Violet Leaf + Cypress Leaf, and Oud + Oakmoss. Also in another one as part of a nag champa accord.\n\nDissolves just fine at 5% in eth. No real noticeable particulate.\n\n**Osmanthus:** Viscous liquid. Holy forking shorts that’s good. Thick, sweet, fruity, juicy nectar, a little honey. Huge peachy/apricot/nectarine note, but also some cherries and grapes. Almost like fruity medicine flavors but beautiful. Flintstones vitamins. Maybe a little mango? I think I’m getting a sweet, clean musky note as well, like ethylene brassylate. Slight medicinal and herbal aspects. A little woody. Nice leathery aspects in the drydown. Elegant. Truly beautiful stuff.\n\nCould go with any fruity thing, definitely peach, apricot, cherry, berries, but also orange and probably any other citrus. Or cleaner woods like hinoki or soft ones like sandalwood. Lactonics could work as well, would do incredibly in a lotion or \"solar\" type. This, benzyl salicylate, methyl laitone, C-14, C-18, you’ve got a gnarly peach-coconut lotion accord. \n\nThis dissolved perfectly at 5% in eth.\n\n**Yellow Champaca:** Viscous liquid. Fat, heady floral, Jasmine vibes, most similar to Frangipani out of any of this crop of absolutes (but darker, like an octave down, to borrow from music). Flat, wide, kind of ugly at first, earthy/dirt, slight sweetness, a little wood, a lot of herb (in the thyme, rosemary, sage vein). Kinda meaty like Pink Lotus, but not quite as meaty or thick and without the smokiness (that's for a different post). Something almost bready/yeasty in there too, or rice? Idk can’t figure that out. There is a touch of sex, sweat, or something animalic/sensual. It becomes more floral as it dries, with some rose coming out. There's something like mead in the long drydown.\n\nObvs this will blend with Sandalwood; it has a huge nag champa vibe about it (I'm using this with the Frangipani for nag champa). Could also do well wrapped in honeyed sweetness, with immortelle and balsamic resins. Smells great with Ambroxan but then, most things do.\n\nA day after diluting to 5% in eth, there was some particulate floating around. Several days later, some stubborn particulate remained, and persisted. But just a little, nothing like Mimosa.\n\nThat's it for round one! This is a monster post and I probably should have broken it up more but eh. Hopefully this is helpful/interesting. Again, I look forward to this community's thoughts on these materials.",

The company was established in 1945 by Dante Bardelli and it has a long standing tradition of making vegan based, hard puck shaving soap. In addition to shaving soap, they also sell bath bars and shaving accessories.\n\n\n70th Anniversary is a chypre scent with notes of Orange, Bergamot, Sage, Rose, Clove, Hydrangea Cedarwood and Sweet Patchouli. This is a bright and pleasant scent that opens citrusy with bergamot and orange before the floral notes of hydrangea and rose pop into the accord. The scent is delicate and inoffensive in the truest sense. Scent strength on this soap is mid off the puck and moves to mid-light upon lathering. Comparable scents that can be found in “wetshavedome” are Lebelle Soaps Classico and Catie's Bubbles Mille Chypre. \n\nSaponificio Varesino utilized their Beta 4.1 soap base for this release, which debuted back in 2015. This vegan base is touted to provide superior slickness and post shave. Ingredients are listed as: Sodium Cocoate, Potassium Stearate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Rapeseedate Sodium, Sodium Sunflower, Aqua / Water / Eau, Shorea stenoptera Seed Butter, Fraxinus Ornus (Manna Ash) Sap Extract, Parfum / Fragrance, Ternifolia Macadamia Seed Oil, Sucrose Cocoate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Starch, Xanthan Gum, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Benzyl Salicylate , Limonene, Citral, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Linalool. The hard puck loads easily in both natural fiber brushes as well as synthetic brushes. The soap is not overly thirsty but does reward the user with a merengue like lather with proper hydration and agitation. The slickness on this soap, both primary and residual are very good, not elite, but better than average by a substantial margin. Post shave is good, but not as good as I expected based on the claims and other reviews I encountered. This soap base receives a shave score of 85, which places it alongside soap bases such as Dr. Jon’s and Blackship Grooming.   \n\n---\n ****Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, \nsponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Saponificio Varesino 70th Anniversary (loaner)  \n\n* Brush - ​Carnavis & Richardson “Industry” (loaner)\n\n* Razor -  Wade & Butcher “Clear” (gift)\n\n* Post - Saponificio Varesino 70th Anniversary (loaner)  \f",

Pearlessence Bombshell Dry Shampoo\n\nIngredients:\nIsobutane, Propane, SD Alcohol 40-B, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Butane, Fragrance (Parfum), Isopropyl Myristate, Silica, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\nReview:\nPearlessence Bombshell Dry Shampoo is a great budget-friendly option for those looking to refresh their hair between washes. The packaging is sleek and attractive, making it easy to carry in your bag for quick touch-ups. The formula itself is lightweight and doesn't leave a heavy residue, which is a major plus. It effectively absorbs oil and adds volume to limp hair, giving it a refreshed and clean look. However, it may not be as effective on very oily hair, and you might need to reapply throughout the day. The scent is light and pleasant, but it can be a bit strong for those sensitive to fragrances.\n\nPros:\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight formula\n- Adds volume\n- Pleasant scent\n\nCons:\n- May need reapplication\n- Not as effective on very oily hair\n- Scent might be strong for some\n\nWNRP\n\n2. Kristin Ess Style Reviving Dry Shampoo\n\nIngredients:\nIsobutane, Propane, Alcohol Denat., Dimethylimidazolidinone Rice Starch, Fragrance (Parfum), Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\nReview:\nKristin Ess Style Reviving Dry Shampoo excels in absorbing oil and refreshing hair without leaving a white cast, making it suitable for all hair colors. The formula is enriched with ingredients that help to extend the life of your style and add texture without feeling gritty. The scent is a luxurious floral fragrance that lingers subtly throughout the day. It also offers a nice boost of volume, making it perfect for those days when your hair needs a little extra lift. The only downside is that it is on the pricier side compared to other dry shampoos. May not work for very oily hair.\n\nPros:\n- No white residue\n- Extends style life\n- Adds volume and texture\n- Luxurious scent\n\nCons:\n- More expensive \n- Not as effective on very oily hair\n- Scent may be strong for some\n\nWNRP\n\n3. Redken Deep Clean Dry Shampoo\n\nIngredients:\nIsobutane, Alcohol Denat., Propane, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Calcium Carbonate, Polyvinylcaprolactam, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Linalool, Citronellol, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Benzyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance.\n\nReview:\nRedken Deep Clean Dry Shampoo is a powerhouse for those who need a heavy-duty product. It’s formulated to tackle even the oiliest of hair, providing a deep clean that extends the time between washes. This dry shampoo leaves hair feeling genuinely clean without the typical dry shampoo residue. It has a neutral scent that is not overpowering, making it suitable for those sensitive to fragrances. While effective, it can sometimes leave hair feeling a bit dry, so it’s best used in moderation or paired with a moisturizing product.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent for very oily hair\n- Provides a deep clean\n- Neutral scent\n- Professional packaging\n\nCons:\n- Can leave hair feeling dry\n- Best used in moderation\n- Very costly for the quantity \n\nWRP",

A lot of the good stuff that I loved for the skin benefits has been moved down the list considerably. I've always loved this bb cream because the #13 shade fits my skin pretty perfectly, and I'm generally demanding of my makeup in that I want it to be making me look better in the long run as well as the short run. Missha's ingredient list seemed to have some pretty great additions to do just that; It had a decent Pa protection rating and some ingredients I valued such as arbutin, squalane, adenosine, and ceramide.  Now... I think I might start looking for a new daily bb cream. Something with a similar shade, equal or better sun protection, but more potent anti-aging and completion-improving ingredients. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them! \n\nFor the curious - I've included the ingredient lists for comparison. While the old list can be found on various old reviews (such as one I grabbed from [here](http://nouveaucheap.blogspot.com/2012/09/review-missha-perfect-cover-bb-cream.html), the latest rendition on [missha's site](http://www.misshaus.com/m-perfect-cover-bb-cream-spf-42-pa.html) has some considerable changes, at least IMHO. Maybe it's less a big deal to others, idk.\n\nOld Ingredients:\n> Water(Aqua), Cyclomethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Zinc Oxide, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mineral Oil, Phenyl Trimethicone, Talc, Arbutin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Dimethicone, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Squalane, Adenosine, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Polyethylene, Beeswax(Cera Alba), Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Caviar Extract, Algae Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Fagus Sylvatica Bud Extract, Ceramide 3, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance(Parfum), Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxycitronellal, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Citronellol\nMAY CONTAIN[+/-; Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891), Iron Oxides(CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499)]\n\nLatest Rendition:\n>Water (aqua), cyclomethicone, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, zinc oxide, propylene glycol, titanium dioxide, caprylic/capric triglyceride, peg-10 dimethicone, cetyl peg/ppg-10/1 dimethicone, arbutin, mineral oil, glycerin, polyethylene, talc, phenyl trimethicone, beeswax (cera alba), iron oxides (ci 77492), sodium chloride, iron oxides (ci 77491 ), iron oxides (ci 77499), methylparaben, dimethicone, propylparaben, rosa canina fruit oil, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, squalane, hydrolyzed collagen, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, disodium edta, adenosine, caviar extract, algae extract, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, sodium hyaluronate, fagus sylvatica bud extract, ceramide 3, fragrance (parfum), hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, butylphenyl methylpropional, benzyl salicylate, hydroxycitronellal, alpha-isomethyl ionone, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, citronellol\n\n**EDIT**: Just fixed a link and some formating :P",

Though, I thought about it more, and in between the two periods I ruined my hair, I was using this shampoo by Herbal & Essences which also does seem pretty drying, but didn’t damage my hair at all (from what I saw physically):\n\nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Magnesium Nitrate, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Rose Extract, Pearl Extract, CI 19140, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, CI 42090\n\nIt in fact has more sulphates, but also more humectants at the same time. Could it be the alcohol? Or is the problem in fact, not the drying of my hair? I’m really lost and scared to buy another shampoo in case I ruin my hair again.",

    "body": "Not sure if this is the right flair. So, I have dehydrated acne-prone skin and am, despite initially thinking otherwise, probably sensitive to fatty alcohols and certain fatty acids commonly indicated as comedogenic. I've tried a ton of products that break me out in small bumps that come to a head.\n\nI've recently taken to moisturizing with just oils over damp skin, which at least stops me from having that tight skin feeling. Interestingly, coconut oil does not break me out. This keeps me from getting the bumps.\n\nI **LOVE** Nivea Soft. It leaves my skin smooth and soothed, calming down PIE and making imperfections like bumps and pores less visible. It works much better than oil and doesn't leave me shiny. It feels that my skin is \"thicker\" and more resilient. However, I'm pretty sure it breaks me out.\n\nThese are the ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum, **Myristyl Alcohol**, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat, **Stearic Acid**, **Myristyl Myristate**, Cera Microcristallina, **Glyceryl Stearate**, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Lanolin Alcohol (Eucerit®)**, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Dimethicone, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Salicylate, Parfum.\n\nI've bolded the ones that I think are problematic. Sudocrem also breaks me out and it contains lanolin. However, it also seems that these are the ingredients that keep my skin soft and looking good. I'm wondering, are there any emollients that produce this effect without being comedogenic?\n\nGel moisturizers like Sebamed don't give me that soft effect. In addition, they also pill when dry, fall off my face and make makeup application very difficult.\n\nI'm currently moisturizing with a mix of water, glycerin and grapeseed oil, and topping it with coconut oil. I thought that glycerin, being a humectant, would be the key, but it's not doing much besides reducing tightness. I'm open to making my own cosmetics.\n\nEDIT: If you can help, point me to specific ingredients rather than products because the products available to me in Europe are different.",

It's a bit expensive, but at least around here most pharmacy brands give free samples and being 100ml, it came out cheaper than most 50ml creams. It does have shea butter. It has an odd consistency though.\n\nThat is the only fatty alcohol free non-gel moisturizer I know. Or maybe, Balea I think has a salycilic acid moisturizer without them and also a Balea men moisturizer, too. But they're both fragranced so they're a no-no for my skin.\n\nIf you were to find out that not all fatty alcohols cause you issues, personally I think Nivea sensitive night cream was very emollient, but it does have cetearyl alcohol.\n\nSome ingredients I find quite emollient are capric/caprylic/coco triglycerides and the shea butter.",

I was afraid that it would be too rich for my skin and would break out, but not at all! I haven't had any pimples, blackheads or congested skin from this product. It nourished my skin and it helped lighten my spots faster while making them completely disappear!\n\nI clearly saw a before and after with this serum, with it some of my scars that had been there for a long time are gone, I'm so happy. I did not notice that I had a brighter complexion but basically I do not have a dull complexion, moreover this product is not enough on its own to moisturize, as it is nourishing I needed other products to hydrate. It mixes well with other products but I didn't use any active ingredients with this serum.\n\nThe only reason I won't buy this product is that it's out of budget... But it comes in a nice heavy 50ml glass bottle and it lasts super long so if you have the budget it's a good investment.\n\nAlso it didn't remove all my scars because I keep having pimples in the same places so before I can even hope to fade some scars I already have another pimple appearing but it's not the fault of the product it's just my skin.So I think it would be better to use it coupled with an anti-acne/anti-pimples treatment or if you no longer have this kind of problem at all just spots to treat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75v0djllg7591.jpg?width=633&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f0b5eafcd614ee676307d0a0b144ff67ddcdb96\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2me0aa7og7591.jpg?width=661&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fbcbed142e03156eb1de72c0795d828852cf1cc",

However, whenever I use random drugstore hair products (whatever's in the shower at an AirBnB or at my in-laws, etc) I get what I can only describe as \"weird body\" to my hair. My hair is straight, moderately oily, fairly fine, and pretty sparse. When I use my LUSH stuff and air dry, it ends up sleek and shiny and lies close to my head (I usually wear it up because it's long and I have little kids). With other products, it dries kind of puffy and is much less likely to stay pulled back nicely. If I leave it down, it's a lot less straight, but not in a flattering bouncy blowout kind of way -- more like sleeping on wet hair when it dries funny.\n\nI'm sure this is an ingredients issue, but I don't know enough about haircare to identify the problem! So here's the ingredients list on what I'm currently using, and I'm really hoping someone will say \"oh, most drugstore shampoos include 6-wibble-wobble-bloopadine and your shampoo doesn't, look for something else that doesn't, I suggest XYZ.\" \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nETA: As best I can tell, my hair is quite low porosity.\n\nBrazilliant (shampoo): Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Whole Fresh Organic Orange (Citrus Aurantium Dulcis), Andiroba Oil (Carapa Guaianensis), Sweet Orange Oil (Citrus sinensis), Ylang Ylang Oil (Cananga odorata), *Benzyl Benzoate, *Benzyl Salicylate, *Farnesol, *Limonene, *Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Amyl Cinnamal, Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellal Fragrance Orange 4 \n\nHappy Happy Joy Joy (conditioner): Rose Water (Rosa Centifolia Flower Water), Orange Blossom Absolute (Citrus Aurantium dulcis), Almond Milk (Prunus dulcis), Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cold Pressed Organic Jojoba Oil (Cold Pressed Organic Jojoba Oil (Simmondsia Chinensis)), Fragrance, Cetrimonium Bromide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Neroli Oil (Citrus Aurantium amara), Grapefruit Oil (Citrus paradisi), Orange Flower Absolute (Citrus aurantium amara), Rosewood Oil (Aniba rosaeodora), Rose Oil (Rosa damascena), Glycerine, Tincture of Benzoin (Styrax benzoin), Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellol, *Limonene, *Linalool, *Citronellol ",

Doesn't mean you can't find cheaper version, just explains why yoy haven't found in the one-size-fits-most types of shampoos in most people's showers.  Like, for example, you wouldn't find a medicated dandruff shampoo as the main shampoo in a hotel bathroom.\n  \nEdit:\n  \nSuggest searching for oil shampoo and among the search results look for one with an emphasis on lightweight and shine (rather than repairing). Redkin Diamond Oil Glow Dry Gloss is an example; cheaper examples can also be found like Schwarzkopf Oil Nutritive shampoo and even cheaper Renpure 7 oils",

I've been using this cream as my daily foundation for over a year and adored it for being lightweight, providing good coverage, and not causing breakouts on my very sensitive skin. Ran out a week ago and noticed a packaging change when picking up my new tube. The feel of the cream is noticeably different and I've started breaking out badly. Reviews on NYX's site, Ulta, and Amazon all confirm that this reaction is pretty across-the-board. Seems there might be a few of the old-formula tubes floating around, so grab them if you see them! (They'll be in a white box, new formula is in black.)\n\nIf you have any suggestions for a comparable replacement please let me know!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOriginal Formula Ingredients - \n\nMade In Poland: Water / Aqua / Eau, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Glycerin, PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide [Nano], Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Zinc Oxide, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Stearoyl Inulin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Hydrated Silica, Propylene Glycol, Tilia Cordata Wood Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aluminum Hydroxide, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Mannitol, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Glycogen, BHT, Yeast Extract / Faex Extract / Extrait de levure, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben, Biotin, Calcium Pantothenate, Fragrance / Parfum, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde.

The new one had poor coverage, made me ridiculously oily, and gave me cystic acne. I have tried so many products to try to replace it. The closest dupe I've found is Sephora's bright future skin tint. I was using nyx bb cream in the lightest shade nude and and shade no. 7 (light ivory) in the skin tint worked well for me. It didn't quite blend in to my skin as easily as the old nyx bb, but I started using a damp beauty blender with it with better results. Other products that were pretty close - wet n wild mega cushion foundation (light ivory) and CYO lifeproof foundation (shade 101). Unfortunately, I think these products may have been breaking me out slightly so I stopped using them. And if it helps, my skin type is pretty dry and flaky, especially around the nose and t-zone, but I also get oily around the forehead and cheeks by the end of the day. Hope this helps someone out there with the same struggles!",

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

        "body": "Maskholic here, checking in. \n\nI usually do a mask everyday, it’s my favorite part of my routine. My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

    "body": "I hope this will inspire experimentation. I have not yet found the ylang I'm looking for, but this progressive analysis has opened up several exciting avenues I would not have found from the final gestalt of each formula.   \n  \n  \nThis trio is said to be the backbone of a banana accord:  \n**\\*\\*Amyl Acetate, Triplal, Eugenol:\\*\\*** Surprisingly, eugenol and triplal independently both have slight mushy aspects that resemble banana. Triplal has a faint, soft, flaky, fibrous texture that resembles banana phloem. On scent strips, when triplal's harshness and dominant soapiness is held near eugenol and is largely masked or darkened, the chord is a faintly on-color banana with a dominant clove. Occasional lines of faint on-color phloem can appear. Though very fragile, Triplal > Eugenol > Amyl Acetate can create a dim creamy banana without any off-colors. Increasing amyl acetate increases harsh orange character. As clove particles depress into a field of plush white, the clove magically whitens and can provide character without color— pairing with triplal or amyl acetate alone does not seems to do this. However, a relatively dark \"spice\" category is still notable, requiring selective attention to achieve complete masking. After the (very quick) top, Amyl Acetate > Triplal > Eugenol can create a very soft, light musty jasmine banana base. In solution, 1:2:3 A:E:T is an unripe banana with definite but incomplete clove masking. 1.6:2:3 A:E:T is nearly clove-masked and has developed the lightly faint vanillic creaminess. Eugenol's vanillic note is brightened, but remains in the mid-zone, sometimes taking a crisp texture. Faint bubblegum sometimes appears. 2:2:3 A:E:T creates a very mushy ripe cloud with high clove masking. Bubblegum is a little easier to see; it feels slightly strident and activates some umami gum tension. The top is slightly sour like anisyl acetate, and some strident lines can emerge that also grant occasional phloem textures. Once amyl acetate volatilizes, clove returns. \\*\\*Jasmacyclene:\\*\\* Up to +2 Jasmacyclene in 2:2:3 A:E:T adds a generic freshness and faint tilt toward melon. Thick clouds prevail and clove's vibratory profile is reduced to fine dust. A creamy banana is still locable, but might require more attentive pressure to dissociate from clove. Overall vague.\n\n**\\*\\*Ylang by Perfumer’s Apprentice\\*\\***, Materials at 100% unless marked.\n\n\\+benzyl salicylate .61, benzyl cinnamate 10%, 1.0: strange methyl benzoate-like mint accord on the top with subtler linen and water texture, marine coolness like florhydral, subtle heater lint cloudiness and faint low-lying cinnamic buzz. Maybe the cinnamate's plum contributes to the florhydral quality, but little else blends. +benzyl acetate 2.21: already a subtle and dignified banana musk that has faint intimations of mushiness. Greatly reduced the acetate's natural harshness. +geranyl acetate .4: adds quite a bit of subtle dissonance to the image and a tiny, slightly painful central citrus. Banana musk is still the greater orientation. Both can be viewed independently. The idea to add paracresyls is already obvious. +geraniol 1.4: there are two obviously competing pitches, one vibratory and slightly harsh, the other low-lying, soft, and plush. A tiny, irritating sour patch kids note is present that is sharper than its analog in geraniol. A citral cereal practically begs for that or linalool to smooth it over. As time goes on, geraniol becomes the dominant citrus. +cinnamyl acetate .3: surprisingly calms the overall profile. Citral arises for the first 30s, then geraniol. Everything is fairly vague and uncertain, but sparkles of that sour patch kids note persist. +linalool 2.45: high diffusion, gives a wide headache. Quite harsh, white, and nondescript at this concentration and on any first perception. Slight bubblegum and banana musk. This profile of harshness seems to relate to toscanol's anisic shortening note. +toscanol .2: I'm genuinely shocked by how this brings out geraniol while being largely effaced in favor of banana cream. It's still quite weird and leans somewhat to gurjun balsam, but is significantly clearer, layered, and visibly complex. +2h eugenol 1.0: the pivotal step in ylang color. Having set up banana, if linalool and toscanol intimate the bright waxy peel, then 2h eugenol is the characteristic wilt of ylang. It makes sense that it's faintly terpenic, but the smoothness and lack of cinnamon is by no means foreboded. Very faint clove. Citral and geranyl noise are rather annoying and chemically on the top, having developed a disgusting Alka-Seltzer note. +paracresyl acetate .05, paracresyl methyl ether .8, methyl diantilis .3: somehow ended up obscuring every note I liked and leaving ylang unrecognizable. I particularly blame the methyl ether and linalool mix.\n\n* Diluted to 10%: Dramatically less offensive, but still too perfumey and vague for my taste. A terpenic lime quality is enhanced somewhat.\n\n\n\nPartially derived from **\\*\\*German patent No. 142859\\*\\***, Materials at 100% unless marked.\n\n\\+0.75 benzyl alcohol, +.022 eugenol, + 1.25 linalool: mostly just linalool, but somewhat reminiscent of clove, acetophenone, and pool chlorine. Somewhat vaguer and more transparent than linalool. +0.375 benzyl benzoate: the terpenic, chalky quality of linalool is clear again, adding a bit of bubblegum while subduing/blending clove and acetophenone. Very faintly medicinal. +0.015 methyl anthranilate: vaguer, but given to a bitter linen strawberry. Dark, almost anosmic fumes near acetophenone and anthranilate. +0.5 benzyl acetate: somewhat close to ylang, but lacking consistency in its main note: falling on linalylic harshness fairly often. However, terpenic and faint mint qualities serve the complexity well. It has occasional umami. +0.2 isoeugenol, +0.1 ethyl salicylate, +0.05 p-cresol.\n\n* Diluted to 30%: Much more stable, but too salicylic and cresylic for a good ylang, and not particularly natural or wilting. It's also vague and noisy instead of creamy. Drydown is more pleasant, but less banana.\n\n\n\n**\\*\\*Red Ylang via Pkiler\\*\\***, Materials at 100% unless marked.\n\n\\+0.23 methyl anthranilate, +0.23 benzyl benzoate, +1.38 phenylethyl alcohol: quite impressively near an acetophenone note without graininess, being mainly terpenic, muddy, and astringent while also smooth and airy. Occasional bright, smooth rose bloom. After top, occasional faint geranylic mulberry. +0.925 linalool, +0.77 benzyl acetate: quite on-color for jasmine, pleasant, but a little too simple. Faint terpenic grit is nice, but the harsh jasmine aspect is also brought out. +0.924 hexyl cinnamic aldehyde: quite near what I would expect from a benzyl acetate-dominant ylang, but missing the characteristic wilt. HCA asserts its mustiness too often. +0.181 peru balsam: once again brings out the bitter jasmine, but overall quite pleasant with a vanilla base. Unfortunately much complexity is lost and acetone discourages seeking. +0.093 paracresyl methyl ether, +0.24 methyl benzoate.\n\n* Diluted to 50%: Massively weakened and obscured. On my skin, it's not totally ruined by the methyl benzoate, but is saved by the muskiness of HCA. The drydown is a nice bubblegum jasmine with faintly nasty but pleasant cresylic musk. Strangely, some benzyl benzoate character emerges as slightly aquatic and algae-like. Finally, terpenic qualities emerge and add both hot pepper and faintly grainy tapas notes.",

If someone can answer any of these I would appreciate it very much.\n\n*Does the saying \"less is more\" apply to this field. Money is one thing (I get that it's an expensive hobby) but the amount of materials you seem to need for a single fragrance is a little intimidating. Would it in theory be possible to crate something palpable from just 10 or so materials? And wouldn't this be a better place to start? \n\n*It seems that the first year (at least) will be dedicated to creating awful fragrances through trial and error and maybe after a couple years you have something wearable. Is it possible that newcomers are overcomplicating things, being too ambitious, adding too much to the mix etc. In other hobbies, like sewing, you would start with something very simple, lika a tote bag, and slowly work your way up to a tuxedo and occasionally be happy with your results along the way. Is there a similar formula that could be applied here, like starting with some very basic recipe and slowly tweaking and adding more stuff to crate personality?\n\n*Question about accents. I read somewhere that the way you \"sketch out\" a fragrance is by starting with the accents and then creating the rest of the perfume around that. Would it be a good approach to dedicate the first year or so to creating just accents (keeping it simple) and then later try to work them in to a finished perfume by gradually adding in additional top, middle and base notes?\n\n*I found a kit on hekserij that I might get. It's 10% cheaper then buying the fragrances separately. Would this be enough to get me started / am I missing out on anything essential:\n\nEO Lemon CP\nEO Orange sweet CP\nEO Ylang ylang III\nEO Black pepper\nEO Bergamot FCF\nEO Clove nail\nLabdanum 45% in TEC\nBenzyl salicylate\nIso E Super (IFF )\nLinalyl Acetate\nHeliotropex N (IFF)\n Vanillin 25% in DPG\nAurantiol 50% in DPG.\n\n*Last question: I don't know what all these Abbreviations mean, dpg iff TEC cp etc. I know eo is essential oil and ac is aroma chemical but other then that I'm a little lost. \n",

Most of the things that I've made have anywhere between 6 and 20ish materials, with synthetics making up a bit over half of most of them.  If I were to exclusively use synthetic materials they would require considerably more components to make them work.\n\nSpending your first year making things that are not good is not an absolute rule, but it is what's most likely going to happen. You spend a bunch of time getting accustomed to your materials, figuring out what goes well with other things, and then try to put something together from there. It is sometimes a case of, \"I like this, but I want something more...something\", so you alter things a little with a bunch of iterations, and sometimes they're worse, sometimes they're better, or maybe they're just different from what you wanted. Something I think is an important aspect is, in the beginning, always consider what you know and like and then expand outwards from there. Always start from a place of familiarity. I spent about 7-8 years casually and only occasionally dicking about with this before I got to the point where I can make something that I actually enjoy wearing.\n\nAdditional materials I would suggest: Hedione (it's used in almost everything, so good to get familiar with it), Star Anise EO (if you don't mind the smell of liquorice), Ethyl Vanillin, Patchouli EO, Veramoss/Evernyl, Ethylene Brassylate, Olibanum/Frankincense.

I managed to catch her in a glass and bring her back outside, but that was probably the biggest bumble bee I've ever seen! Wish I got a picture, but I was too focused on getting her outside.\n\nI'll probably get some flack for the way things are diluted (especially eugenol which could have been one part at 10%) and that four of the materials are in the same strength and amounts, but I'm purely a hobbyist and trying to save money and this is how it ended up working out. I'm open to critique but gonna call those out on my own.\n\n|Material|Dilution|Parts per 100|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol|10%|25|\n|Florol|10%|15|\n|Linalool|10%|13|\n|Eugenol ex clove|1%|10|\n|Ylang Ylang III|1%|7|\n|Benzaldehyde|.01%|7|\n|Laevo Citronellol|10%|5|\n|Petitgrain Bigarade|10%|5|\n|Benzyl Salicylate|10%|5|\n|Lindenol|10%|5|\n|Geraniol|10%|3|\n|||= 100|\n\nAnother thing I'll call out on my own is I saw a suggestion on another thread about using heliotropin to give a blend more of a lilac/fruit blossom character, which I didn't use because I apparently lied to myself about ever buying any. If I rework this I might add just a trace of indole for a little more realism, but I'll be real with you that stuff scares me because I continue to struggle to use it responsibly so it hasn't been worked into this formula (yet). 😬 I considered swapping ylang with jasmine for that reason but I really wanted the sweetness from the ylang ylang III.\n\nThanks in advance for any feedback! Hope you have a great day!\n\nEDIT: I should emphasize that this is def not cherry blossom. I only mentioned it because I had cherry blossom on the mind while thinking of a specific floral smell. It's an accord I'll have to take a crack at sometime, but I just wanted to share whatever this is because this is my first considerable \"win\" in the short time I've been practicing perfumery, in terms of making the smell I was thinking of",

Also petitgrain at 5% is really strong. Indole can be used for realism if you want jasmine but I don’t think it’s completely necessary for a cherry blossom. And lastly all flowers have green notes which youre missing. \n\nBut great job and have fun :)",

I've been reading and researching about it but got even more confused so I thought I'd ask here lol.\n\nAbout three weeks ago I decided to get one and my hairdresser told me not to use anything containing salt (but said nothing about sulfates, or i might have missed it lol). So, I got the Loreal Eversleek shampoo because its advertised as specifically made and a safe shampoo for keratin treated hair. After I got home I started reading the ingredient list and to my surprise, sodium chloride is listed as an ingredient! So I guess what im asking is if its safe to use? Has anyone tried it? Will it strip off the treatment out of my hair? I dont really get the \\~science\\~ behind it and the differences between using sodium and salts and sulfates.   \nI also have been using a sodium free but not sulfate free shampoo, and I dont really like it so I wanna know if this is safe and worth giving a shot. \n\nHere's the ingredient list: AQUA / WATER / EAU  \nSODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE  \nLAURETH-5 CARBOXYLIC ACID  \n**SODIUM CHLORIDE**  \nCOCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE  \nGLYCERIN  \nPEG-150 DISTEARATE  \nPARFUM / FRAGRANCE  \nCOCONUT ACID  \nSODIUM BENZOATE  \nSODIUM LAUROYL GLUTAMATE  \nPOLYQUATERNIUM-10  \nSALICYLIC ACID  \nHEXYL CINNAMAL  \nLINALOOL  \nBENZYL SALICYLATE  \nBENZYL ALCOHOL  \nHELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED EXTRACT / SUNFLOWER SEED EXTRACT  \nLIMONENE  \nCITRONELLOL  \nSODIUM HYDROXIDE  \nLACTIC ACID FIL CODE D55635/1\n\nAlso I think is worth mentioning Im from a little country located in South America, so my access to hair products is very limited, and the ones that we have are super overpriced compared to the states.\n\nThank you so much in advance !",

        "body": "I've been getting keratin treatments (and color) for years. My stylist has always told me to use sulfate-free products and to avoid anything (including styling products)  that has sodium chloride in the ingredient list. IIRC it has something to do with sodium chloride effectively stripping the keratin out of your hair and being abrasive. She explained it to me like this (I'm paraphrasing): You know how when you go swimming in the ocean (or gulf or whatever salt-water body of choice) and your wet hair dries its a little bit crunchy and clumpy? That's from the salt. \n\nScience time: Sulfates are derived from sulfuric acid. They are in a wide range of products, but their primary application is as a lathering or cleansing agent. You know how shampoos that have sulfates lather really really well and sulfate-free ones don't? That's why. Sulfate's purpose in this universe is to clean things and its really good at it. For a person with non-damaged, non-chemically treated a shampoo with sulfates is probably fine. \n\nHowever, for anyone with a compromised cuticle (the outer part of the hair strand; this includes anyone with color or chemical treatment) sulfates are sketchy because they're *too*  good at their job. Most clarifying shampoos just have a lot of sulfates in them.\n\nBottom Line: Your hair isn't gonna fall out or melt off and using the shampoo won't completely strip your treatment out all at once. But sulfates and sodium chloride will decrease the longevity of your treatment. Probably by 25-50%, depending on how frequently you wash your hair.\n\nNB: someone please fact-check my science, chemistry was a reeeaaaaallllly long time ago.",

I don't have a routine, and never have, and think that having some idea would help! I usually try and avoid parabens and SLS. I went to my local chemist today, and these are the two cleansers (are they cleansers? I think they are) that I came up with:   \n  \n- Clearasil Daily Clear 'Vitamins & Extracts Daily Wash'.   Pomegranate, Vitamin E, Antioxidants, and Avocado. \n     *Aqua, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Bentonite, Kaolin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Arcylate Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Sulphate, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Salicylate, Persea Gratissima Leaf Extract, Punica Grsnatum Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, Sorbic Acid, CI77891, CI42090, CI 19140*  It also says not to apply it around the eye area.   \n  \n- Goat Moisturising Body Wash  \n*Aqua, Goat Milk, Cocamidopropyl betaine, Glycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Xanthin Gum, Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium sorbate, Citric acid*\n   \nAny thoughts or opinions on them?  \n  \nAt the moment, I use an ego QV tub of Repair Dry Skin Cream. I've had it for about ten years (wow! That's a bit disconcerting, really), and it doesn't have the ingredients on it. Just:   \n*Glycerol 10% w/w, light liquid paraffin 10% w/w, soft white paraffin 5% w/w* and *Methyl hydrobenzoate 0.2% w/w, dichlorobenzyl alcohol 0.1% w/w* and *Perfume free, lanolin free, propylene glycol free, pH6*  \n  \nI use T.N. Dickinson's Witch Hazel as a toner, although it is 14% alcohol.   \n\nUsually I just clean my face with my hands and water in the shower, follow that with either air drying, or a rub with the towel, then witch hazel, then the moisturiser. \n  \nFor sunscreen, I use either Olay Complete Defence daily UV moisturising lotion 30+, or the black Banana Boat 30+. I don't think you can get more than 30+ in Australia.   \n\nI'm a 23 year old girl, and I think my skin tends towards being dry while my chin and nose are a bit oilier. I don't wear make-up very often, if that makes a difference. And my budget is a bit limited. \n\nThanks!",

I'm not sure why the Clearasil one contains clays... that would be typically to be oil-absorbing.  It might be slightly drying, but you could try it.  The goat wash actually looks great.  I'd use that on my face any time.  \n\nThe Repair Dry Skin Cream looks pretty good .  - but the % of product doesn't add up to 100% so I'm not sure what else is in there.  But it's a lot of glycerin,  mineral oil and wax, essentially.  \n\nSome people find that chemical sunscreens are mroe comedogenic than physical sunscreens - I know that I do.  So that might also be something to think about.\n\nUsing some AHA would probably be nice as well - it's really helped my skin be smoother, softer, more uniform in color and way less clog-prone.",

        "body": "Why is it a problem to have silicone on the hair shaft? Specific emollients in hair care products are there for a reason. Iirc polyquats are even more difficult to remove than amodimethicone, but why bother? These ingredients impart shine and smoothness and are somewhat protective (among other things). Your hair does not contain living cells and does not require nutrients to be delivered into the inner core, nor does it require water inside the hair shaft. In fact, from my research less water in the hair shaft is ideal. So a layer of emollients will do more good than harm imo.\n\n\nObviously buildup will occur after some time, and when this occurs you can always use a clarifying shampoo. I was strictly no sulfates/silicones for a few years for my curly hair. Nowadays knowing the science behind things, I don't understand the movement.",

        "body": "There seems to be some disagreement about which cleansers remove which silicones. Amodimethicone is definitely one of the harder silicones to remove. My shampoo has that same cleanser, and some people describe it as essentially a sulfate while others say it's the most stripping of the non-sulfates but still weaker. If it were me, I would go by how my hair feels. If your hair seems gunky, sticky, or like it won't detangle the way it normally would, you can throw in a suave daily clarifying wash. If not, maybe your hair just likes being coated in silicone (or the shampoo is cleaning adequately) and you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to watch out for is that those heavy silicones tend to prevent oils from getting to your hair, so if you feel like your hair is really dry, or like the texture of it when unconditioned is getting worse, that may be a sign to switch conditioners or at least do a sulfate wash and use a silicone-free deep conditioner before you resume using the amodimethicone one.",

It burns my skin as well (though it is not as bad as some others it is still there.\n\nI am ready to burn the P&G headquarters to the ground, I'm beggin you all – please help me figure out which ingredients could be causing the burning on my skin. I attached product photos of as many products I tired I could find/think of w the ingredients lists since sensitive on the product labels clearly means nothing. \n\nIf u have product suggestions I'd be grateful for those as well, but since I live in Europe n a lot of users on this sub are living overseas chances are it might be difficult to get my hands on some of those so the best would be to find out which ingredients could be what makes my skin burn.\n\nHere are ingredients list so they are easier to copy/compare:\n\n**The one I can stand and my skin liked very much:** Aqua, Palmitic Acid, Triethanolamine, Isopentane, Glyceryl Oleate, Stearic Acid, Isobutane, Sorbitol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PEG-90M, BHT, PEG-23M, Myristic Acid, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Lauric Acid, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Linalool, Silica, Lecithin, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate\n\n**The one I can’t stand A:** Aqua, Palmitic Acid, Triethanolamine, Isopentane, Glyceryl Oleate, Stearic Acid, Parfum, Sorbitol, Isobutane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PEG-90M, Citronellol, Silica, Lecithin, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, CI 45350, CI 42090\n\n**The one I can’t stand B:** Aqua, Palmitic Acid, Triethanolamine, Isopentane, Glyceryl Oleate, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, Isobutane, Sorbitol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Parfum, PEG-45M, Tocopheryl Acetate, Menthol, Limonene, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Mentha Piperita Oil, Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil, PVM/MA Copolymer, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Silica, Tocopherol, Lecithin, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate:\n\n**The one I can’t stand C:** Aqua, Palmitic Acid, Triethanolamine, Isopentane, Glyceryl Oleate, Stearic Acid, Isobutane, Sorbitol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Parfum, PEG-45M, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Silica, Tocopherol, Lecithin, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, CI 42090\n\n[ Gillette Series Pure & Sensitive shave gel I can stand](https://preview.redd.it/dn7q03ho501c1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=128bc37b0fea8388cb60976e572fa8c10ed67417)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gillette Classic I can't stand](https://preview.redd.it/hc6z3r89601c1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6d28d7c1eb4cd6e98e99350b5e737c6a90887b9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gillette Skin Ultra Sensitive  I can't stand](https://preview.redd.it/ya2sgvyc601c1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4136fbc95251da38b1709d365b15a4689737fe11)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gillette Satin Care Sensitive Aloe Vera Glide  I can't stand](https://preview.redd.it/r56oyl4i601c1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0ce0b7eb5d7aa9e17da3b2e30de4e47c0fed0ea)\n\n&#x200B;",

If you don't, you might be sensitive to one of the ingredients in the sunscreen. \n\nIt looks like that sunscreen has a lot of fruit extracts and fragrance (Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Linalool), both of which could be extremely irritating. It could even be the aloe. If you want to isolate the ingredient that's causing the stinging you can compare the ingredients with ingredients of other products you're using and experiment a little. Not everyone is sensitive to the same ingredients. \n\nI'd suggest just  using a different sunscreen.",

Most chemical sunscreens sting for me, but some don't even when the actives are the same as the ones that generally sting me. Even taking into account other potential irritants like fragrance and certain plant extracts, it still seems random.\n\nFor example, Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch SPF 30 doesn't sting me even though it has 3 chemical filters, fragrance, and irritating plant extracts. When I use other sunscreens with the exact same filters, I usually get some sort of sensitizing reaction like redness or a burning sensation.\n\n¯ \\ _(ツ)_/¯",

    "body": "So far I co-washed two times.\n\nFirst time I did it the lush way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage, wash, put significant amount of conditioner on hair from roots to ends, wait, wash. The hair was clean, I think it was too clean, there was more resistance when brushing vs after shampoo washing, there was significantly more hair left on my hands (and on the brush when brushing too I think) when applying the product. I think the hair was somewhat sticky and waxy, but not too much.\n\nThe second time I did it the easy way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage (and in the process get a bit on the hair and ends too), wait, wash. The hair was clean enough (not shampoo-clean, but I think that's better for my hair and for my scalp's accomodation). There was more resistance when brushign vs after shampoo washing (and I think also vs the first co-wash). There too was significantly more hair left on my hands when applying the product, but because it was applied only once it was this much less hair loss. My hair is sticky, waxy. It looks good, but feels really bad, because of the stickiness.\n\nI used warm water.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if I brush my hair downwards while leaning down, the hair will literally stay in the air afterwards as if I gelled it or something. This effect is present to some extent after I shampoo-wash too, but not this extremely. It's also quite difficult to brush in the first place.\n\nThe conditioner somewhat sticks to the hair even while washing with it, the consistency of conditioner is gluey, sticky, it doesn't make my fingers run through my hair with conditioner applied run buttery smoothly, but rather the complete opposite, I'm scared of pulling my hair out this way... No hair loss when rinsing it off. \n\nMy scalp is also itchy as fuck now. My guess is the preservatives Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are to blame, but the thing is the shampoo has them too, so maybe not and the waxiness or whatever (co-washing in general) causes this?\n\nI'm pretty certain that the conditioner causes this. I didn't use any other product. When I wash with just shampoo from the same brand (it's SLES based, but it's the opposite of potent, I take few times more of it to achieve the same potency that normal SLS shampoos have, could be the conditioner is similarly \"potent\") and either don't use any other product or only few drops of oil it won't be like this and it's pretty much what I want.\n\nThe ingredients of the conditioner:\n> Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Inula Helenium Extract, Humulus Lupulus Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Cera Alba, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Chamomilla Recutita Oil, Geranium Sibiricum Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-12 Dimethicon, Pinus Sibirica Needle Extract, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Ceteareth-20, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nNote that Cera Alba (Bees wax), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (guar gum derivative) and PEG-12 Dimethicon (water-soluble sillicon) are in it. Could it be that the Bees wax is the problem? The two other ingredients are water soluble so shouldn't be... Cera Alba (Bees wax) is also in the shampoo, but probably in smaller quantity.\n\nIngredients of the shampoo:\n> Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract*, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Glycine Soja Oil, Urtica Dioica Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Water*, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract*, Salvia Officnalis Oil, Carum Carvi Fruit Oil, Mel*, Saponaria Officinalis Root Extract*, Cera Alba, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nShould I buy another conditioner, keep on using this one or switch to non-harsh shampoo? If I should switch conditioner, what ingredients should I be looking for except no wax and sillicon? No oils? Other surfactants (glucosides instead of kationic chlorides)? Something more oily? Something very minimalistic (just kationic surfactans like cetrimonium chloride and humectants like cetearyl alcohol)? Something with more humectants?  I wouldn't be super happy buying another conditioner just to find out it's trash and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nEdit: My hair is ~5inch/13cm long.",

        "body": "I'm no expert and this is just personal experience over the past several years but I would try an SLS-free shampoo & silicon-/wax-free conditioner to see if that helps. It sounds more like an issue with the conditioner ingredients or other products sticking to your hair and scalp then not getting washed out with the co-wash so it builds up on your hair more and more. I tried many conditioners to co-wash and also water-only but neither worked for me. My hair ended up stringy, heavy and waxy though not as quickly as you have experienced. I have very hard water where I live which can also add to the problem.  You can also look into an apple cider vinegar rinse as an alternative (lots of info on the side-bar).\n\nI have had good success with SLS-free shampoo plus silicon-free conditioner every second wash or so. I only have to wash it once a week with water-only rinses as needed in between washes and my scalp is much less itchy and dry than when I was using regular shampoo or co-washing. When particularly dry and itchy, I use jojoba oil on my scalp as a mask/cleanse before I shower, massage it in well, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash out . This also helps with any build-up of product on my scalp.\n\nIt will probably take some trial and error to find out what works for you and a bit of time for your scalp to transition. You may also need to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build-up on your hair before starting over to give you a clean start but not everyone needs that step.",

Simple. \n\nIf you are switching to low poo products and just using those, I would say it’s probably a bit of waxiness from transition. That’s normal and just a matter of lifting the waxiness (apple sauce mask, egg, or a full-poo shampoo) and forging ahead.  If you’re still using full poo products (which it looks like you are, regardless of how you’re using them) it’s probably just a bad formulation for you and/or the water coming out of your tap.   Find something inexpensive to try.  Burt’s Bees, L’Oreal Paris Evercurl or Evercreme cleansing conditioners, Nature’s Gate, VO5 conditioners in the white bottles (if they’re still packaged the same as when this list was made) are all fairly widely-available and often fairly inexpensive options.",

Thank you for your help with this! I've been running some experiments since and figured out that the culprit was indeed the Ambrocenide. \n\nI made up three test batches with the same formula as described, one with Ambrocenide at 0.1%, one without it, and one with a tiny trace amount (1 drop or about 0.015 g at 1% dilution).\n\nThe batch with the trace amount performed the best, and I now know what people mean when they say ambrocenide can really lift a fragrance - even with that tiny amount it's more punchy and forward, which I like, but without that chemical burn feeling in your nose.\n\nHowever, some of you also picked up on coumarin as an off note in this, so I played with the formula some more, as one does. Here's the current draft, which I've been testing for a few days:\n\nSandalwood EO 10\n\nCedar EO 7\n\nPatchouli EO 1\n\nBenzoin Resinoid 6\n\nAmbrocenide 0.01 or Trace\n\nTimbersilk 15\n\nSylvamber 14\n\nHedione 10\n\nBlood Orange EO 4\n\nBlack Pepper EO 0.75\n\nVanillin 9\n\nEugenol 0.5\n\nBenzyl salicylate 5\n\nCinnamic Aldehyde 0.25\n\nLinalool: 1.5\n\nOTBCHA: 5\n\nKephalis 5\n\nBeta Ionone 3\n\nDihydromyrcenol 3\n\n\n\n Happy with it so far, but we'll see how I (and my tester) feel after giving it some time.",

    "body": " \n\nGillette Guard shaving cream introduction & review.\n\nA couple of days ago, I went to the local pharmacy at work after lunch. As I often do, I quickly glanced over the shaving products rack, & I saw something new. Gillette has launched a new shaving cream in India, - Gillette Guard shaving cream. I assume that it is intended to be paired with Gillette Guard razors. I’ve used those super cheap Guard razors & found them extremely good for very quick shaves as they shave like a safety razor while still being in a pivoting cartridge format. I feel that if Gillette can make an equally good shaving cream, it ought to be worth trying. So I picked up a tube. The tube has 125 grams of product (4 oz) & is priced at the low, low price of 49 Indian rupees, or 68 US cents. That’s an amazing price, which is weight for weight, probably about half that of most normal shaving creams in the region.  Most other shaving products here contain about 3oz, & cost just over $1.\n\nThe tube specifies on the packing that it can be applied by hand or a brush. Since I normally shave with a brush that is how I plan to apply it to test it.\n\nThe ingredients are, Water, Stearic acid,  Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut oil, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate/HEMA Crosspolymer – 2, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Silicate, Azadirachta Indica seed oil, Fragrance, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Limonene.\n\nThe ingredients seem fairly standard, except for the acrylates & crosspolymer. On looking them up, I found that they are gelling agents.\n\nI applied cream today morning with a brush & lathered up after a shower. My Omega 10029 came up in the rotation. The product in the tube was white & looked more like toothpaste than shaving cream. I applied more than usual, since I wanted to test the performance, & I was a little afraid that the gelling agents might affect the performance. The product applied more like hair gel than shaving cream, while there was lather, & the bubbles were tiny, which is a good indication of higher potassium/sodium ratio, but the lather felt funny. On shaving the first pass WTG, I found that while the lather felt slick enough when rubbed between my fingers, the lather had very, very little lubrication indeed while shaving & I could really feel the blade in the Tech type razor. After the first pass, I felt that I could not continue to shave this way, & perhaps the lather would do better with a cartridge razor, so I did my next pass with a cartridge. If I’d wanted to continue with the DE, I’d have had to change the lather. Since it was the lather that was being tested, not the razor, I switched to a Sensor Excel razor for XTG. At that point, I had no trouble with the second pass, but the lubricity was still lacking. \n\nI’m beginning to suspect the gelling agents are being used as fillers in this formulation. If the gelling agents were not there, this product would be  thin soapy water.\n\nI’m going to experiment with using the cream again tomorrow, this time used brushless before coming to any conclusions or making any statements. There is no way I’m going to use this product with a brush again.\n\nUPDATE Day 2 :- I used that cream again today without a brush. I can confirm that it works well & was most probably designed primarily as a brushless cream. In fact, it's a fairly good cream when applied that way. No nicks or cuts & a pretty smooth face. A good, close shave.\n\n\nWhile looking at the package, I re-checked the how-to blurb about applying it. It reads 'Using your hand or a brush, lather the cream & then apply the cream to your beard'\n\nWhile that's not proof , the fact that using it by hand has been mentioned first before the brush does make me think that it was designed to be used primarily without a brush.\n\nI'm a little concerned about the gelling agents in this formulation. (Carbopol Smart 3000 or equivalent). I have never seen them in any similar product before & I know nothing about their safety. They've been around for less than five years, which is not enough time for issues to come to light.",

The geosmin may fill the room (or the house), but it isn't necessarily a \"strong\" odor in the punch-in-the-nose sense; it's more that humans can detect geosmin at 1 part per *trillion*.",

Custom cart includes a mix of 34 AC's and naturals, along with Base de Parfum and Vitamin E all for about $200 shipped. Scenthusiasm kit (100 AC's and naturals) plus the BdP and Vit E would probably be $290 shipped. Scenthusiasm dilutes more of their stuff in the kit, while I would get more neat stuff in my custom cart.\n\nIf yall think the cart below is adequate I might just go for that and fill in the gaps with individual buys in later batch orders:\n\nWoody:\nCedarwood Virginia EO 15ml, Iso e super 15ml, Sandalwood givco203/20 4ml, Guaiacwood EO 4ml, Vertofix 4ml\n\nResin: Benzoin 50% 4ml, Labdanum abs 50% 4ml, Frankincense 4ml\n\nHerbaceous: Patchouli frac 4ml, Tomato leaf key accord 4ml, Hexenol-3-cis 4ml, Oakmoss abs 10% 15ml\n\nCitrus: Bergamot EO 4ml, Lemon cold press 4ml, Lime distilled 4ml, Linalool 4ml, Citronellal 4ml\n\nGourmand: Vanillin crystal 8g, Ethyl maltol 8g, Fructone 4ml, Coumarin 8g\n\nMusk/animalic: Ambroxan 8g, Ethylene brassylate 15ml, Exaltolide total 4ml, Galaxolide 4ml\n\nFloral: Rose givco 217 4ml, Ionone beta 4ml, Orange flower key accord 4ml, Hedione 15ml, Geraniol 4ml, Benzyl salicylate 4ml, PEA 4ml, Hydroxycitronellal Pure (High Laurine) 4ml\n\nOzonic: Calone 10% 4ml\n\nOther:\nBase de parfum 1L, Vitamin E 4ml\n\n(I know spicy stuff is missing, I figured I'd focus my next order on getting a lot of spices and spicy AC's)",

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nI am aware that getting exposed to the sun is not healthy and that a high protection (over 20 SPF) suncream should always be used. However, I am interested to know whether there is some science behind the claims made by many companies about their tanning accelerator creams. Not those that stain your skin but those marketed to actually increase melanin pigmentation through exposure to the sun.\n\nI tried searching on pubmed but didn't find much information on the topic. There seem to be many companies which created their own personal private formulas but is hard to find what those formulas are actually made of (e.g. biosine complex in the Australian Gold accelerator, or Illumitone for Piz Buin).\n\nSo what ingredients really work and should be looked after in the ingredient lists of tan accellerator lotions?\n\nFew examples of products I found online are:\n\n**PIZ BUIN Tanning lotion**\n\n\\[PR-011240\\], Isopropyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Tridecyl Salicylate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Alcohol Denat., Acetyl Hexapeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Aqua, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum\n\n**Australian Tanning Accelerator**\n\nWater\\\\Aqua\\\\Eau, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Lanolate, Fragrance (Parfum), Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Panthenol, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Terminalia Ferdinandiana (Kakadu Plum) Fruit Extract, PPG-20 Methyl Glucose Ether, Cetyl Acetate, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Limonene, Coumarin, Linalool, Benzyl Alcohol, Citral, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Yellow 6 (Cl 15985)\n\n**Collistar dry tanning oil**\n\nC12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Zea Mais Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol, Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Parfum, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Glyceryl Oleate, Caproyl Tyrosine, Daucus Carota Sativa Seed Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Juglans Regia Shell Extract, Ci 47000, Ci 26100, Ci 61565, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Limonene, Eugenol, Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellal,, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Linalool.\n\nOr sinply walnut husk oil.\n\nThank you all in advance!",

        "body": "Funnily, I had a similar question last year that went unanswered too. So I'm not sure about the products you listed, but there was one product I did find (in my post history, I think) where the main ingredient was L-Tyrosine and then looked into this amino acid more.\n\nL-Tyrosine is an amino acid necessary for the formation of melanin. However, it is also a precursor to dopamine. There is a subreddit of folks looking into supplements for a boost of energy and many tried L-Tyrosine. Some reported that when they took L-Tyrosine they found that they happened to tan 'easier' to sun exposure in addition to a temporary energy boost. \n\nIDK how effective L-Tyrosine is when you apply it to the skin, though, I never tried it. Additionally I cannot say whether it is safe to ingest for extended periods of time due to its role in dopamine production (and also melanin production).\n\nI haven't looked at this topic in awhile but you can definitely look into L-Tyrosine and Dopamine biochem pathway and find articles related to that on pubmed!\n\nEdit: Just wanted to look into the topic more and found this article:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4345932/ states that ingesting tyrosine via pills or applying via cream has not been proven to work and is potentially dangerous, but couldn't find much else.\n\nSo, I'd be wary of products marketed towards accelerating tanning!",

        "body": "The company is correct.  \n\nThe phtyokeratin (hydrolyzed wheat protein) and silk protein is sort of like a rope with magnets woven in.  The \"magnets\" are like a perfect \"key\" shape to fit into the perfect \"lock\" hole in your hair.  We would normally only need 0.1-0.2% protein to achieve this, because that's the practical limit of how much we can put into the bottle, but also anymore just goes down the drain.\n\nAnalogy: your hair is like a piece of fuzzy rope covered in armor plating.  There are holes in that armor and the fuzz pokes through almost like Velcro.  The protein binds to the rope that isn't covered by armor.  When it dries that protein turns into new armor.  Your hair strand is now coated in a tough film that is resistant to oil.\n\nIt doesn't work for every type of hair.  It works best for fine, limp hair.  It doesn't work as well for kinky or stiff hair.\n\nThe fixatives such as formaldehyde do different chemistry on hair.  The purpose of those is to react with disulfide bonds in hair.  You don't want a fixative in a product with protein.  It's going to react in the bottle and you will destroy the benefits of either.\n\nAnalogy: take my fuzzy rope covered in armor.  Put cement on the ropey bits.  It's going to fix in place.",

The use of \"...hydrolyzed protein which we fix with formaļdehyde\" suggests that during the treatment (heat?) of the hair, there is an equilibrium between HCHO-X-linked protein, and HCHO-X-linked keratin (hair). These treatments are generally preceded by a reduction step (R-S-S-R') reduction, 'relaxing' the hair fiber. This is followed by the X-linker, in this case HCHO released by the X-linked protein in the product.\n\nI was involved in the assessment and banning of the original formaldehyde-containing product from this company where I live. Really dangerous for hairdressers, and I wonder how much free formaldehyde is released during application?",

For lye there's 2 to choose from-Potassium Hydroxide is what gives those soaps a softer final product, and Sodium Hydroxide which makes a harder soap. For your fats there's tons to choose from, but over the years soapers have figured out Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid impart the qualities that shavers desire, a smooth, dense, creamy lather. Tallow and butters like Kokum, Mango seed have the most stearic acid, however straight stearic acid (which is 99% of the time actually a 50/50 mix of stearic and palmitic acid) has tons of benefits in immediately raising the Stearic/palmitic numbers and allowing for soapers to add other beneficial ingredients (like shea and other exotic fats) without sacrificing the qualities we value . Coconut oil (cocos nucifera) is ubiquitous for its bubble formation, it doesn't take a bunch, especially for shave soap. Too much and it can be drying or stripping on your skin which is why it's always further down from anything containing stearic acid.\n\nI'd say you're probably allergic or sensitive to a fragrance, maybe all of them.\n\n  \nI'm surprised sodium cocoate is the number 1 ingredient in SV, a famously excellent soap. I never would have guessed it to be honest, as a soaper I try to limit the coconut oil to the lowest I can.",

Trust me, this is something I can appreciate. But I have never understood why cologne is so expensive? I mean how difficult or costly can it be to put good smelling chemicals in a bottle. I ventured out to try some off brand cologne. And truly off brand, as the price of Tarragon Noir is $1 at the local Dollar Tree. The brand is described as high quality matched with high value for the demanding lower end consumer. Wow, they are not shy about their demographic!\n\n**Drakkar Noir Cologne Knock Off**\n\nTarragon Noir is the off brand or knock off version of Drakkar Noir a well established cologne by Guy Laroche. Drakkar Noir cologne is no doubt a classic having been on the market since 1982. It is a reasonably priced cologne. A 3.4 oz bottle of Drakkar Noir is available at Walmart for $35.58. The marketing for the product is focused around the themes of darkness and masculinity.\n\n**Made In India**\n\nI am familiar with Tarragon Noir from the local Dollar Tree. But I was surprised to also find it online, including Amazon. The packaging clearly states that European American Designs (the product line this cologne is featured within) is not associated in any way with Drakkar Noir which is a registered trademark of Guy Laroche. You don’t need to read the packaging to know this. As one simple smell will do the trick.\n\n**Tarragon Noir Cologne Ingredients**\n\nWhat exactly goes into a cologne? The ingredients for Tarragon Noir Cologne include:\n\n* Alcohol Denat\n* Water\n* Fragrance (Okay, but what fragrance?)\n* Benzyl Salicylate\n* Limonene\n* Linalool\n* PEG-40 Hydrogentated Castor Oil\n* Hydroxycitronellal\n* Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene\n\nAs I said, a bunch of chemicals.\n\n**Tarragon Noir Cologne Review**\n\nHow does the smell of Tarragon Noir compare to the real thing? The actual smell itself is wildly similar. At the first smell, this product seems like a promising bargain. The difference is in the nuance and subtly of the fragrance. It is too potent at first, but then wears off quickly. With Drakkar Noir, you can apply in the morning and then have a subtle but masculine scent throughout the day. The knock off does a pretty good job matching the overall scent, but it comes off initially with an artificial punch, and then fades throughout the day. The artificial or lack of nuance to the fragrance clearly demonstrates a lower quality or less optimized product.\n\n**European American Designs**\n\nThe product is sold at the Dollar Tree through a USA Distributor of European American Designs, Arion Perfume & Beauty Inc. According to the company’s website, they focus on value price fragrance categories offering seven hot selling European fragrance line for Men and Women in the Americas. So in other words the Tarragon Noir cologne sits within a portfolio of men’s value fragrance products which include:\n\n* Astute For Men (knock off of *Angel Cologne* by Thierry Mugler)\n* Pure Water Men’s Cologne (knock off of *Acqua Di Gio* by Giorgio Armani)\n* Compulsion Men’s Cologne (knock off of *Obsession For Men* by Calvin Klein)\n* Enthral Cologne For Men (knock of *Envy* by Gucci)\n* Hulk (knock off *Hugo Cologne* by Hugo Boss)\n\n**Men’s Cologne At Ross Dress For Less**\n\nIn terms of the cologne, I am veering off course and suggesting you stick with the name brands. I wouldn’t over pay for the designer brands, but for cologne and perfume I would purchase something reputable. Discount retailers such as Ross Dress For Less and T.J. Maxx offer budget, name brand product lines at discounted prices. I have recently tried Paris Hilton For Men, Tommy Bahama St. Barts Eau de, and a few varieties of the Adidas cologne line. While still more expensive than I would like, at least you won’t smell cheap.",

My question is does anyone have any good sites where I can order fixatives? I'm looking for things like Abroxin, benzoin, Labdanum, Civetone, hedione, Benzyl Salicylate, etc. I'm from Australia if that helps. Any help would be super appreciated, ive looked everywhere!",
