    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

        "body": "I appreciate you taking the time to write this up and the thought and effort behind it. I will say though that there is one part you should seriously consider editing:\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nThis is very incorrect. While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

    "body": "Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.\n\nSo I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467087\n\n#What is hair?\n\n>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*\n\n>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*\n\n[Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1083/7638/files/Hair-Anatomy-e1421050694589.png?v=1505924657)\n\n\n#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?\n\nOver time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.\n\nPrior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.\n\nIn recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.\n\nMost proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.\n\n#How does shampoo work?\n\nThe main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is \"create suds\" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.\n\n>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* \n\nWhat this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.\n\nSurfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.\n\n[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) \n\n* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.\n 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate\n 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate\n 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate\n 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.\n\n* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.\n\n* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.\n\n* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.\n\nAll shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word \"sulfate\", though)\n\nHigh end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.\n\n#####How often should I shampoo?\n\nYou probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n#The benefit of conditioner\n\nModern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.\n\nThe solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. \n\nA conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. \n\n>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*\n\nConditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:\n\n* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner\nPolymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)\n\n* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)\n\n* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]\n\n* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.\n\nThe big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.\n\nLike all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.\n\n*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.\n\n#How to wash and condition your hair.\n\nThe way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.\n\nShampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. \n\nOnce the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.\n\nLeaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.\n\nAfterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. \n\n(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)\n\n#TL;DR?\n\n* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. \n\n* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\n* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. \n\n* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.\n\n* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.\n\n* The key to good hair care is not going \"no poo\" or \"sulfate/silicon free\", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I believe your statement to be true that sulfates themselves wont stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. However, washing your hair too often will substantially raise the rate at which your scalp produces oil and thus the rate at which your hair gets greasy. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that when you wash your hair and scalp, you'll also inevitably stimulate the skin in that area, creating friction which results in more blood flow that will make the sebaceous glands \"work better\". The second reason is that by washing your hair you'll also remove the oil from your scalp. Leaving your skin in a dry condition. Dry skin will make your sebaceous glands work overtime to fix exactly that problem, as their main function is to lubricate and waterproof your skin. \n\nTldr: Don't wash your hair too often, it will get your hair greasy fast. It can also cause dandruff in the long term by overstimulating the sebaceous glands.\n\nSource: Studied hairdressing and am a barber.",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "Edits: Tried to fix some formatting issues. \n\n—\n\nHi everyone! \n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/?st=JIATDG0T&sh=d905c745), I talked at length about the skin condition of rosacea -- what it is, the subtypes, what the causes are, the foundations in treatment (cleansing and moisturizing), as well as treatments and beneficial ingredients. This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "I got my first pimple at age 9, actual acne/breakouts at age 10, and suffered a lot from it since. But I've learned a lot of great things along the way and there seems to be so many misconceptions from beauty magazines and the internet, so I wanted to share you things I know. Here we go!\n\n1. **Dermatologists are not always the best source.** Most dermatologists specialize in serious skin issues such as skin cancer. Many don't really understand acne as well as you would think. I went through three separate dermatologists who were all considered the top of their practice in my city (a large metropolitan city). But it's usually a painful cycle of trying this anti-biotic then that anti-biotic. Then they'll try whatever prescription creams they can on you as if its just a laundry list. I know too many acne sufferers who wasted their money. *If you choose to go to a dermatologist or any other licensed skin specialist, make sure they are specifically specialized in acne.* \n\n2. **Quit dairy.** Get your calcium from non-dairy options or vitamins. Milk should be substitued with almond, NOT SOY, milk. Almond milk tends to have less sugar (and calories!) and soy has potential to make acne worse. Goat cheese is your best cheese option, or dairy-free cheese. Lactose-free dairy products could still be dairy products. \n\n3. **Regularly change your pillowcase.** This is a VERY important tip! It does make a difference!\n\n4. **Do NOT use face washes and shampoos with sodium lauryl sulfate/sodium laureth sulfate** ammonium lauryl sulfate is okay, I've never heard of anybody break out specifically from it. *Cetaphil face wash is an acne nightmare.* Don't use it! Avoid fragranced products as well. \n\n5. **Do not overeat eat anything with iodine** This includes certain supplements and seaweed. Iodine triggers acne. \n\n6. **Birth controls, particularly Yaz or Ortho-tri cyclen, can help** But some can harm, so ask an expert before using it. \n\n7. **Use benzoyl peroxide starting with no more than 2.5%, then if necessary upgrading to 5% after a while.** Never go over 5%. 10% can be used but only for spot treatment, and use a q-tip to treat. \n\n8. **Eat dark chocolate to stop sweet cravings, but avoid other sweets as much as possible.** I shoot for 80% dark. \n\n9. **Use powder face makeup.** Powders as foundation can give adequate coverage and are far less likely to cause breakouts. Liquids and creams are usually too heavy and can clog pores, even if labeled oil-free or non-comedonegenic. I recommend Almay face powder or even Bare Minerals which has good coverage. \n\n10. **You MUST wear sunscreen every day, even if it's cloudy or winter-time.** I recommend Elta sunscreens, they are lightweight and don't cause breakouts, I personally use them. Don't use a moisturizer if your skin is oily, a sunscreen can double as one.  Look for sunscreens with physical blocks, like zinc oxide. Invest in a good sunscreen so you don't spend hundreds on anti-aging products later. ",

I went on it before I lost my virginity b.c I had super irregular periods and pretty bad pms, including moderately bad acne.  IT WAS MAGICAL.  My skin cleared up in a month and my periods were light and regular with almost no bloating, cramps etc.  Then all of the sudden (3 years later) I started having these weird mood swings at night.  I would be totally fine all day and then just get really sad or angry or giddy or vacant or just plain old miserable.  every night.  So I went to the dr. they told me it was stress (totally wasn't my life was going amazingly well at the time).  It progressively got worse to the point that I was miserable or numb 24/7 with random interjections of hysteria, both crying and laughing, for no reason whatsoever and also completely, 100% lost my sex drive. didn't want to be touched.  every doctor i went to told me it was stress and i needed to do yoga or something.  I thought I was manic depressive and was freaking out.  This had been going on for two months.  till finally my thoroughly fed up bf at the time did a lot of research and told me it could be my pill.  went off it immediately and my mood elevated in a day.  It took almost 6 months for my mood to totally even out again and to get my sex drive back. \nMoral of the story? Yaz has way too much estrogen in it which over long periods of time will FUCK YOU UP.  Don't do it girls!\n\nTL;DR : Yaz was awesome till it made me go crazy.  Estrogen pills=bad news bears",

It normalizes gut bacteria and helps with acne control.\n* Avoid cow's milk dairy, sugar, caffeine, and citrus.

    "body": "So it was you, SULFATE SURFACTANTS!!\n\nI've had two patches of dyshidrotic eczema on my right palm for... I don't even know how long now, a couple months? And I've been using steroid cream on it for a while (betamethasone dipropionate in the form of Fobancort cream at first, and later Gentriderm cream which is slightly stronger) but every time it got a bit better, it would soon relapse again. It was extremely frustrating and I couldn't figure out the cause... until now.\n\nBoth my toothpaste and my shampoo contain sulfate surfactants in the form of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES). Aside from causing my dyshidrosis to constantly relapse, I'm also suspecting that SLS/SLES caused the dyshidrosis in the first place. I only have two patches of it on my right hand, but none on my left hand or anywhere else. So if it's a contact allergy, it would have to be something that only comes into contact with my right hand. I use both hands to wash my hair, but I only hold my toothbrush in my right hand, and toothpaste gets on it pretty easily. Thus, my right hand is in contact with more SLS/SLES than my left.\n\nI happened to get two sample packets of shampoo while buying stuff from The Face Shop (it's a K-beauty store, but I'm not a fan of most of their products for face - too many fragrances) recently, and noticed that it was free of sulfate surfactants. Instead, it used disodium laureth sulfosuccinate (DLSS), which tl;dr [isn't a sulfate and is very gentle on the skin](\nhttps://slsfree.net/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate/).\n\nI had also started noticing some itching on my right palm after washing my hair, so I decided to try the sulfate-free shampoo for a couple nights to see if it made things better.\n\nIt did. The redness and inflammation has gone down a lot in just two nights without relapsing, when previously it would keep coming back even though I was using steroid cream and Permasol (potassium permanganate solution, prescribed by the doctor to be diluted 1:8 with water and used as a wash, for drying out the blisters) daily.\n\nI also did a bit more experimenting by using another shampoo we have at home, which has ammonium lauryl sulfate and ammonium laureth sulfate instead of SLS and SLES, but my dyshidrotic eczema started itching immediately. (ALS/ALES are supposed to be less irritating than SLS/SLES, but evidently they're still too irritating for me.) \n\nI went out and bought the full sized sulfate-free shampoo, which is the Dr Schwarz Shampoo for Damaged Hair. It's normally priced at $21 (Singapore dollars) here, with the hair treatment conditioner being the same price, but due to a promotion I got both for $30, which is nice. I'm hoping that my dyshidrosis will finally recover without relapsing now that I've gotten rid of sulfates. I'll also be holding my toothbrush in my left hand for the time being... may look for sulfate-free toothpaste in the future as well.\n\nSo yeah, if you've also been playing whodunnit with your skincare / shower ingredients to find the potential cause of a contact allergy... it might be sulfates.",

    "body": "My One Year AB-versary is coming (Okay, it's still two months off, but I'll be in the middle of moving), so now is as good a time as any to give you guys some reviews on all the product that I've tried (and failed) to introduce my skin to.\n\nA quick rundown, I started my AB journey last year in August when I decided to get serious about sunscreen use. I live close to my work, and in the summer I wanted to start walking home every day to enjoy the weather but, of course, I didn't want to catch fire in the process. I had been to Japan on a couple of occasions, my co-worker had talked to me about [snails](https://media.giphy.com/media/MBzMzNna9VDUc/giphy.gif), but aside from that I knew less than nothing about Asian skincare. \n\nSo, I did what any young lady with a head full of brains would do in my case, [I Googled it.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/20/33/01/203301fbebef2b8273b35a00e7e1a859.jpg)\n\nAnd I honestly didn't do too badly! I found Innisfree's website and started looking around at the products they had, then I looked up Korean skincare on Reddit, and hit on [this place.](https://secure.static.tumblr.com/98e2ee58a9c82b0c4a115cd9f035f9be/vxnkqmk/jgXnnvgky/tumblr_static_filename_640_v2.jpg)\n\nI started reading, researching and learning the terms. About 3 weeks into it, I felt I knew what my skin type was (Combination Oily/Dry/Sensitive) and what I wanted to address (the outbreak of acne on the sides of my nose, triggered by my nose being itchy because it was dry and I kept rubbing it... ), so I selected my products (lots of Innisfree Green Tea Fresh line, sheet masks, and sunscreen!) and placed [my order.](https://www.facebook.com/tlskrdl/videos/740821496047378/?pnref=story)\n\nAnd you know what? Not everything worked. Some of the first things I'd hand picked after all my learnings caused breakouts. Or dry patches. Or cranky skin. \n\nI learned to put it down. I used just my cleanser, and just a toner and serum and I'd give my skin a break. When it was looking better, I'd start again. I tested, and re-tested, and stopped using certain things altogether. It wasn't perfect. My skin still wouldn't be happy from time to time.\n\nSometimes it would take minutes for a reaction. Yes, really. \n\nSometimes it took days. \n\nTwice it took a couple of weeks. O_O\n\nBut I kept reading, and googling, and checking up on products, and what other people with my skin type were using, and how they were faring and what their sensitivities were.\n\nI even eventually discovered that I was wrong about my skin type as Combination/Sensitive. I began to lean more towards possibly having Dehydrated/Sensitive skin, and hopefully when my next order arrives I'll be able to confirm my self-diagnosis.\n\n**PSA**: A year later and I do still struggle sometimes. I'm working toward an overhaul of my routine, I'm destashing and re-purposing some products. And I'm still learning as I go. It has been worth it though, and I hope that anyone who reads this and is maybe considering the switch from western to asian skincare learns from my mistakes, or at least keeps them in mind. :3\n\nNow, onto the reviews! While I do want to talk about EVERYTHING, I probably shouldn't. So, I'm going to do a run through mostly of what I currently use, what it does, and why I'm restocking or not restocking. I will also have some words to say about the stuff that I'm NOT restocking (ever), because every good review deserves a bit of balance so I don't sound gushy. I HAVE had issues with products, and it's important for skin twins and lurkers to know why it didn't work for me. We should all keep an eye out for each other when it comes to preventing reactions and increasing understanding. Right? Right!\n\n**Currently In Use:**\n\n* Innisfree Calming Gel Cleanser (Discontinued) - Only used once a day, otherwise my skin gets over cleansed and sad. The rest of the time, it's happy and I am going to miss this cleanser like CRAZY. Trying to find a replacement has been the worst thing ever. ;_;\n\n* Innisfree Minimum Toner - I use this twice a day, it does contain Madecassoside which is good for cell turnover. I'll pair this with the Jeju-Bija Anti Trouble Toner if I'm having a breakout.\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-trouble Toner - Fantastic when I get a reaction and whiteheads start appearing. My skin isn't really oily enough to use it on a daily basis though.\n\n* Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum - Another \"good when I have a reaction\" item. Since I suspect my skin is dehydrated, not combination, I don't find it does much in the way of keeping my skin moist unless I spritz with bottled water first. Minimizes whiteheads and irritation though, so it is a keeper \"just in case\". Not gonna lie, it's also the [smell!](http://i.makeagif.com/media/5-25-2014/nfFqQz.gif)\n\n* Innisfree Minimum Ampoule Essence - My evening Essence, but it doesn't have any actives or really hydrate my skin. I may not purchase this again, which is a huge loss because of the [smell!](http://i.makeagif.com/media/5-25-2014/nfFqQz.gif)\n\n* Innisfree Green Tea Fresh Essence - Interesting jelly-like texture when you pump it out of the bottle. If I had to give up my Green Tea Seed Serum for good, I'd use this as the next layer. I probably won't purchase this again, though as it seems a bit redundant.\n\n* Innisfree Green Tea Fresh Cream - I love the clarity, love the scent, love the fact that it slowly sinks into my skin and makes it feel fresh. But it;s not intended for dehydrated skin and it doesn't really lock moisture in. I have one more jar coming, and once I'm through it I'll be looking at other gels with more hydration.\n\n* Innisfree Green Tea Sleeping Pack - Not a perfect occlusive layer because it can take forever to sink into your skin. Once I woke up coated in cat fur after using it in the summer. However, I've used this during the day as a lotion in the winter because of how dry it gets indoors and found I liked it better. I would repurchase again for sure as a winter cream. \n\n* Innisfree It's Real Sheet Masks in Rose, Bamboo, Aloe and Cucumber - Basic sheet masks, now that I've tried others. Nothing wrong with them, but nothing overly special either. Sometimes a girl just needs a basic, soothing sheet mask. Be aware that they DO contain alcohol as the 4th ingredient and if you DO choose to use them on sensitive or dehydrated skin, you might want to take them off after 10 minutes or so of use. Will not repurchase as the money can be put towards something better.\n\n* Innisfree Skin Clinic Masks in BHA, Vitamin C and Collagen - I do like this line better, although the amount of actives in each mask is unknown. That being said, if you'd like to try Vitamin C or BHA and you're not even sure it will work for you, these sheet masks are a good way to dip your toe into the world of actives. The fit is quite nice, and the sheets are soft and thin. I can leave these on for much longer than the previous masks, since they have no alcohol in them. \n\n* Innisfree Capsule Packs in Seaweed, Green Tea, and Volcanic Cluster - The Seaweed is easily my favorite. It's mildly exfoliating, and I love the [smell](http://i.makeagif.com/media/5-25-2014/nfFqQz.gif) and the warming effect when it goes on your face. Green Tea wasn't bad, I tried it only once and then had a mild reaction afterwards. I was also in the middle of testing a new cleanser too, my bad. I'll have to give it a shot again later. The Volcanic Cluster is like the foaming wash without the soapy effect. Good for drying up excess oil, so on my face it wasn't the greatest thing, but at least it made it feel soft when I washed it off. Seaweed is a repurcahse. I need to give Green Tea another shot, and the Volcanic Clyster is a nay.\n\n* Creer Beaute Sailor Moon Miracle Romance Masks - Bought them on a whim. Lovely rose scent, but otherwise nothing to get excited about. They ARE hydrating though, and no alcohol. I'll finish the box, but I don't think I need to repurchase ($25 for 5. No. Fricking. Way.)\n\n* Skinfood Rose and Shea Butter Hand Cream SPF 25 PA++ - I mostly use this at work, I LOOOOOOVE the rose [smell!](http://i.makeagif.com/media/5-25-2014/nfFqQz.gif) I notice if I use too much, most of it wipes off on the files and my desk. One bottle lasts for quite some time because I use it sparingly now. I'll repurchase only because it's easier to keep at my desk without everyone in the office using it up on me. :(\n\n* Skinfood Marshmallow and Honey Hand Cream Snoopy Limited Edition - Guilty Pleasure! Another one with a great smell, and the texture is like marshmallows when you squeeze it out. Combine that with the honey and it's hard to not lick it off your fingers when you are done rubbing it in. I bought one extra for my boyfriend to use at work because his hands get very rough and dry as well. This sinks in and he loves it. TesterKorea brought in a few more bottles, and I ordered three more last month. Gonna miss it when it's gone though.\n\n* A'pieu Peach and Shea Butter Hand Lotion - This is my day to day lotion. The fresh peach smell is awesome, and the shea butter keeps everything soft. I like using it after a bath on my dry legs and elbows. Definite repurchase.\n\n* Berrisom Sheep Sheet Mask Vitamin C and Arbutin/Cat Sheet Mask with Collagen - I've only tried it once and it made a decent enough impression that I'd like to try more of this line. I'll pick some more up in Japan this year before I make a final decision.\n\n\n\n**Benched:**  *(Full size product, this list reminds me why decants, samples, and patch testing are a thing!)*\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel - I tried this twice. Once as the first cleanser, then as the second. It worked better as a first cleanser, but I can't do it two days in a row. I think it's just too stripping for my skin. Nice scent though, if it were a body wash, I'd use it.\n\n* Innisfree Eco Safety Aqua Perfect Sun Gel - This is the \"within minutes\" reaction I talked about. I was excited to have it with me during my last tip to Japan, and I thought the acne I was getting was because of the sweat and oil built up under the sunscreen itself. Took me until March of this year to realize it was the alcohol and the triethanolamine in it that was making my skin react. Sorry, Innisfree. You dropped the ball on this one.\n\n* Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel - Biore, you were supposed to be the one! The prophecy foretold you! I paid $20 for the bottle!! The alcohol burn wasn't worth it though, and it took a week of all-day sleeping packs and ampoules twice daily to get my skin back to \"not awful\". Sorry, Biore.\n\n* Innisfree Minimum Foaming Cleanser - It had less ingredients than my Calming Gel Cleanser, reviewed well, and was inexpensive too boot. After a week my skin felt like it had a net stretched over it when it was wet. Holes and more holes. A very strange way to tell me no, but I heeded my skin's advice. \n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Trouble Spot Essence W - The only anti-acne product I've had give me more acne. It was a purchase from Japan and the product wasn't even available on the website anymore when I looked it up to find the ingredients. Tossed it after one use.\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti Trouble Lotion - Too thick for my skin. Another anti-acne product that causes irritation, but that has more to do with the fact that it's in a lotion base and my skin doesn't like lotions. :<\n\n* Innisfree Apple Juicy Cleansing Oil - I tried, and tried again. I don't mind the smell, it has good slip and it feels nourishing. BUT. My skin reacted! Why? WHY! I don't know why. My first foray into oil cleansing, and it didn't go unpunished. :(\n\n* Holika Holika 92% Aloe Shower Gel - This is the \"weeks\" reaction. I bought it in Japan, loved the smell, and brought a couple bottles back to Canada. I was down to my last bottle, had just ordered two more from Tester Korea, and I noticed the dry patch on the inside of my arm that was itchy. All. The. Time. Then came the cracked and sore dry patches on the backs of my hands. :| .... at least my boyfriend likes it, because it's ALL his now. FYI - This contains Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate. :/\n\n\n\n**Tested:**  *(The following were samples or one time buys.)*\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam - Nice foaming cleanser, but my skin can't handle it more than maybe once every two weeks.\n\n* Innisfree It's Real Rice Sheet Mask - The essence had a nice light scent, but it was thicker and creamier than a regular essence. It also irritated my skin just a bit, probably because of the alcohol.\n\n* Innisfree Skin Clinic Hyaluronic Acid Sheet Mask - Hyaluronic Acid has a specific job, and I didn't see it in my skin. Thankfully, it was a gift with purchase.\n\n* Innisfree Berry Hydrogel Mask - Nice and luxe, but irritated my skin ever so slightly. Maybe when my moisture barrier is up and protecting again, I'll give hydrogels another try.\n\n* Tatcha Camellia Cleansing Oil - A sample from Sephora, not bad. This is what got me thinking that maybe I COULD oil cleanse somehow, but not for the cost. The inclusion of Rice Bran Oil has me thinking I could try that on its own and see where things go.\n\n* Derma Dr.Lab Hydromoist Balancing Cream - Love the scent, but it leaves a slightly waxy cast on my skin as the day goes on. It also keeps my skin hydrated well, but this is probably more suited for someone with dry skin. \n\n* Missha Super Aqua Ultra Waterfull Cream - Oh god the smell. I hated testing this because of the smell and it's a shame because it succeeded in ways the Derma Dr.Lab failed. Sorry Missha. Maybe the gel cream version will play nicely.\n\n* Boscia Tsubaki Cleansing Oil Gel - Not bad, and I was getting excited until I found Innisfree's Broccoli Gel Cleanser was only $5 for the tube. Sorry Boscia. I'll give the cheaper alternative a shot first if it means it will work just as well without breaking the bank.\n\n* The Saem G-Dragon Eco-Energy Gel Mask Sheet [Moist-Bright] - I liked it! Tested it twice in Japan and my skin seemed happy. Got back to Canada with 5 more of them, and by mask #2, my skin revolted. Now they're expired, but I keep them around just to look at [GD's pretty face.](https://media0.giphy.com/media/KBzHGfLb6WpBS/200.gif)\n\n\n\n**New Arrivals:**\n\n* Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV SPF 50+ PA++++ (Testing phase - I am SO EXCITED about this sunscreen, you guys!!!!)\n\n* Sunkiller Perfect Strong Moisture SPF 50+ PA++++ (Unopened)\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Lava Seawater Skin (In Transit)\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Lava Seawater Essence (In Transit)\n\n* Innisfree Broccoli Clearing Gel Cleanser (In Transit)\n\n* Innisfree Soybean Energy Essence Light (In Transit)\n\n* Skinfood Peach Sake Silky Finish Powder (In Transit)\n\n* Mediental Snail Collagen Aquaring Gel (Purchased at Winners, Unopened)\n\n\n\n**Wishlist:**  *(Hoping to purchase these items in Japan this year, if anyone has any reviews, I'd be happy to read them!)*\n\n* Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk\n\n* Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Oil\n\n* Dr Ci Labo Aqua Collagen Gel\n\n* Mizu No Tenshi Gel\n\n* Moonflash Cushion\n\nThat's it!

These are all silicones you'd want to avoid:\n \n* Cetearyl Methicone\n\n* Cetyl Dimethicone\n\n* Dimethicone\n\n* Dimethiconol\n\n* Stearyl Dimethicone\n \n* Amodimethicone\n\n* Cyclomethicone/Cyclopentasiloxane\n\n* Trimethylsilylamodimethicone\n\nNot so hard, right?

    "body": "So I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, commenting with advice, upvoting good hairdays, nodding my head in agreement with all the \"what the hell is going on with my hair\" vents. But three days ago, I was inspired to carry out an ambitious undertaking. In this post, I shall endeavor to identify and discuss (almost) every method of hair washing available to you, the anonymous human being on the other side of the Internet. In doing so, I hope I will assist those of you that are still searching for the One True Washday Routine.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a professional, nor am I a mod. I am a random stranger who has been wearing my hair naturally curly for the past decade. I'm bored, on Reddit, and I'm procrastinating on some important life choices. Make of that what you will.\n\nWithout further ado, and in no particular order, let's begin:\n\n**The Traditional - Shampoo + Conditioner**\n\nListen, we've all been there. Walk into any local department store and you'll find yourself staring up at the overwhelming variety of shampoo/conditioner duos. There's A LOT of shampoo on the market. But shampoos are not evil. They are a tool. Shampoos come loaded with surfactants - molecules which help oil, dirt and grime dissolve in water so the mess can be washed away. Not all surfactants are treated equal. Know what you're buying and why you're using it the way you are.\n\nSome quick highlights:\n\n* Shampoo containing sulfates (examples: sodium or ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium or ammonium laureth sulfate, etc) - **necessary for blank slate reset washes**\n* Shampoo lacking sulfates (examples: cocamidropropyl betaine, disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate, etc.) - **can be used as your regular cleanser OR only occasionally to clarify build-up** depending on the formulation and the needs of your hair\n\nT**he Bold, the Daring - ...just Shampoo, no conditioner**\n\nYou know that friend or relative of yours that doesn't use conditioner at all? Just slaps some shampoo on, maybe a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner, and calls it a day? Maybe you were that friend or relative to the people in your life. Kudos. This is pretty drying for most people, so I wouldn't recommend it. But your head is definitely clean after this.\n\n**Too Bold, Too Daring - ...just Soap. Or Soap + Conditioner**\n\nLike, a bar of soap. No shampoo. Just soap. Yes, I know someone that did this for years, and yes, the hair survived. I wouldn't recommend this either, but there are some naturally derived soaps that advertise themselves as being safe for use as a shampoo. Just. Soap is easily more drying than sulfate shampoos unless you are using a very specific kind of soap in a hair-friendly way (African Black Soap or Castile soap used in some DIY shampoo recipes spring to mind, but I don't endorse or condemn them personally). Walk in with your eyes open and Google ready to go.\n\nNote: some shampoo bars use soap as their cleanser. Do your research and be aware that soap-making transforms some or possibly all of the \"oils\" on the ingredient list into soap, which means those oils aren't moisturizing anything anymore.\n\nEdit note: Soaps naturally have higher, alkaline pH (around 9 or 10) that can be damaging to hair, which maintains a slightly acidic pH (4.5-5.5). If using soap or soap-based recipes, check that the final pH will end up on the acidic side of things. (Thanks to u/[nicestshawtyalive](https://www.reddit.com/user/nicestshawtyalive/) for catching this oversight.)\n\n**We Need More Power - Shampoo + Deep Conditioner**\n\nWhat's the difference between a normal conditioner and a deep conditioner? Consistency, moisturizing power and time. Mostly time. Deep conditioners (also called masks or masques) are designed to be put of wet hair and left there for AT LEAST 10 minutes, usually more. This gives their heavy-duty ingredients time to penetrate the hair and restore some of that sweet, sweet moisture. Best practice is to slap a cheap shower cap or plastic bag over the deep conditioned hair and apply some mild heat to the outside, allowing the product to steam into the hair. A hooded dryer, a soft dryer bonnet or a winter hat thrown over the shower cap will all serve in this situation. Deep conditioning right after shampooing can really blunt the dryness that shampooing can cause.\n\n**We Need Less Power - Diluted Shampoo (+ conditioner)**\n\nNobody said you had to use shampoo straight out of the bottle. Get yourself a squeeze bottle at the dollar store, add some shampoo, add some water, shake it up, and go. Or just dilute each bit of shampoo in your hand in the shower before applying. Diluting will lose you some of the cleansing power, but that's the trade we make for less dryness.\n\nNote: do not store diluted shampoo. You diluted the preservative as well, so assume that diluted shampoo is not shelf-stable anymore. Store at original concentration and dilute on-demand.\n\n**Through the Looking Glass - Cowash, aka Washing with Conditioner**\n\nWho needs shampoo when you have liter bottles of conditioner in your house? More seriously, there are surfactants that help moisturizing ingredients stay dissolved in water-based liquid conditioners, and there are surfactants that help smooth down your hair follicles for that smooth, soft look. Gently scrub your scalp with conditioner surfactants, and you'll get dirt and grime rinsing off with the conditioner. Not as thoroughly as shampoo, mind you. But let's be honest, do you really need squeaky clean hair all the time? No shame if the answer is Yes, and no shame if the answer is No. Conditioner is still here for you.\n\n**Once More, With Feeling - Cowash + Conditioner**\n\nThis could be the same conditioner applied two different ways or two different conditioners. First conditioner, you scrub your scalp and clean your hair. Rinse ALL of this off - this is the stuff with all the dirt in it. Then second conditioner, you treat like a normal conditioner - letting it sit in your hair for a few minutes, squishing it in, rinsing out, etc. This gives you the benefits of less powerful cleaning as well as the softness of the conditioner.\n\n**Big Brain Moment - Shampoo at Roots Only + Conditioner**\n\nAre your roots oily, but the rest of your hair is dry as f\\*\\*\\*? Do you need to use a medicated drying shampoo on a regular basis? (Shout-out to all the people with dandruff/psoriasis!) Well then, apply your shampoo to right where it's needed, scrub, and rinse. The rest of your hair will get a diluted shampooing when you rinse, which might be all it needs. Follow up with some conditioner and profit.\n\nPro-tip: consider putting your shampoo of choice in a squeeze bottle with a small tip that you can apply directly to your roots. Dilute the shampoo if necessary for spreadability and lowering the strength a bit. Avoid applying conditioner to your scalp if conditioners aggravate your scalp condition.\n\n**All the Usual Suspects - Shampoo at Roots Only + Cowash + Conditioner**\n\nSame as above, but now you're actively cleaning your hair with a cowash step. Highly recommended for people with both dry hair and a scalp in need of shampoo-level cleansing who get wigged out when they're told not to wash their ends. (Honestly, I'm right there with you, I gotta give my ends some attention too.)\n\n**A Strong Foundation - Pre-poo + Shampoo + Conditioner**\n\nPre-poo (or a pre-wash treatment, if you can't say pre-poo with a straight face) is anything applied to the hair before washing with a shampoo. Pre-poos can help moisturize the hair and scalp, assist with hair detangling, and help blunt the cleansing power of harsher shampoos. Common pre-poo options are oils (like coconut, olive, avocado, or castor), conditioners (whatever suits your needs), and detanglers (which is a sub-type of conditioner sold by several curly brands).  They are especially useful for very dry hair, hair that is too fine or too low porosity to use oils in their stylers, and hair that easily tangles.\n\n**Exfoliate That Scalp - Scalp Scrub (+ Shampoo) + Conditioner**\n\nWhether we're talking about a pre-formulated sugar or salt scrub you pick up at the store, or a DIY concoction that needs to be washed out later with shampoo, scalp scrubs take the battle to the dead skin cells hiding in the hardest to reach skin on your body. Use responsibly since over-exfoliating is something your wouldn't want to deal with on your head. May help with scalp conditions depending on your particular problem and body chemistry.\n\n**Tools of the Trade - Shampoo Brushes + literally any routine previously described**\n\nWhat is a shampoo brush? It's a little plastic thing with silicone nubs that you use to rub your scalp. [Here's an example from Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/Scalp-Massager-Shampoo-Brush-MAXSOFT/dp/B074ZDXFL6) If you have trouble using your fingers to scrub and massage your scalp in the shower (shoutout to the dandruff people in the back), shampoo brushes can be very handy. Be gentle with this, you don't want to bear down on your poor head with too much pressure.\n\n**Who Buys Their Products in the Haircare Aisle Anymore? - Assorted DIY or Non-traditional Cleansers**\n\nI'm cheating a bit here and leaning on r/NoPoo for these examples. People have been cleaning their hair long before shampoo was invented, and people will continue cleaning their hair with things that aren't shampoo. Brave pioneers, we salute you!\n\nSome examples I'm aware of:\n\n* Diluted Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV): used as a rinse to clarify hair. Watch the pH on this badboy and any other DIY remedies as natural things are not necessarily safe to put on your hair. That said, people swear by ACV.\n* Clay/mud masks: Like the masks you put on your face, but for your hair instead. CHECK THE pH as clay dissolved in plain water can end up too alkaline for healthy hair. (Thanks to u/[nicestshawtyalive](https://www.reddit.com/user/nicestshawtyalive/) for the catch!)\n* Herbal rinses: Is there anything plants can't do?\n* Baking soda recipes: NOT RECOMMENDED by the r/curlyhair mods as per the subreddit wiki. I also don't recommend baking soda for haircare as the acidity/alkalinity levels of baking soda versus healthy skin/hair is just too far apart.\n* Water: just water. Just...warm water? Huge power move.\n\nNote: I cannot vouch for the safety and efficacy of DIY recipes. Eyes open, Google up and out.\n\nAaaaaaaaand that's all I got. I've definitely left some methods out, I'm sure, but this list is as complete as I can get it. If you have another cleaning method you'd like to see added, comment below and I'll add it in. I hope this helps at least some of you with terminology and choosing the routine that best suits your lovely head of hair.",

I’ve found it useful to dilute some conditioners, too, particularly if they’re very thick.\n\nMy current routine is experimenting with Indian herbs to wash my hair; both shikakai and aritha are herbs that can be used whole or powdered, as a paste or rinse, to wash hair with. So far I’ve tried both twice individually, and once together; I think I like shikakai on its own best, though I’m planning on adding in more herbs, such as amla, brahmi and fenugreek, in different ratios, to work out what washes best.\n\nOn the weekend, like tonight, I do a henna gloss, which will be CO washed out with lots of conditioner.",

    "body": "As a stylist, the most frequent question I get is “how often should I shampoo?”. My response always is \"first and foremost, it's important to know how to shampoo properly so when you do, it counts\".  From how shampoo works to the most common ingredients, I answer all of your shampoo-related questions below. \n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html))\n\n**How does shampoo work?** ​\n\nYou can think of the active ingredient in shampoo as being within [two categories](https://www.nycoproducts.com/resources/blog/simple-science-the-difference-between-soap-and-detergent/): (1) non-detergents (soap) and (2) detergents. Non-detergents are made from natural ingredients and act as an emulsifier for oil and water. This makes it easier to rinse impurities away when it's washed out. Detergents are synthetic, man-made chemicals with active agents (wetting agents) capable of lowering the surface tension of a liquid. These are known as [surfactants](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/), and they do this by having a hydrophilic \"head\" and a hydrophobic \"tail\", which essentially allows the shampoo to stick to oils and dirt in your hair. Those oils and dirt are then swept away when washed out. Another way to understand the difference between non-detergents and detergents: the former will leave a residue behind while the latter will not.[ ](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/)[Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html) breaks down the purpose of other ingredients you'll find in shampoos to make them effective and pourable (i.e. the opposite of powered shampoos that are becoming more popular). \n\n**How often should I shampoo?**\n\n​Some hair types will need to shampoo daily and others only need to wash once every ten days or so. Preference also plays a role here depending if you're trying to achieve a sleek look or a voluminous one. Shampooing less will condense your hair over time and allow it to hold more oils, which shampooing more will remove oils and promote a fuller look. Think about the following factors as you keep reading through this post, and check out [Post-Workout Hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-post-workout-hair.html) to learn more tips and tricks for managing your hair with a busy life.\n\n*Your hair's density*\n\n* ​*Fine:* Needs to be washed daily, particularly if you have skin that is more oily. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too flat if they try to style it without washing and drying it first. \n* *Thick:* Can be washed anywhere from once every three days to once every ten days. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too voluminous or puffy if they wash too frequently. Thick hair also takes longer to blow dry and style, making it a nightmare to wash daily because of the amount of time it adds to your routine. \n\n*Your hair's condition/damage*\n\n* ​*Fine:* If your hair is breaking due to damage you should try to shampoo less - every other day to every three days. Giving your hair a break from washing and styling can help with mitigating damage. Use shampoos and conditioners that are moisturizing, even if they give a flatter look then you like. \n* *Thick:* Damage to thicker hair shows more prominently because there is more of it. Straight hair will often appear to have many flyaways, while on curlier hair damage can be easier to hide. Since your styling routine is already longer because of how much hair you have, avoiding a full wash and blow dry (i.e. heat) for as long as possible can help with mitigating damage. \n\n*The type of shampoo and conditioner you use*\n\n* *Fine:* If you aren't worried about damage, look for a volumizing shampoo and conditioner for day-to-day use. Clarifying shampoos will help strip extra oil from your hair, but should only be used once a week alongside a shampoo made for daily use. Avoid clarifying shampoos if your hair is damaged. \n* *Thick:* Look for moisturizing and hydrating shampoos to counteract your volume. [Co-washes](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/news/a56230/co-washing-benefits/) are also a great option for curlier hair, and can be used more frequently since they are a combination of shampoo and conditioner. They're a great option if you need to wash more because of your workout schedule or job. ​\n\n*Your Scalp*​​\n\nYour scalp is an important part of figuring out how, and how much, to shampoo. This takes trial and error, plus may change over time. Generally, you should wash as often as your scalp can handle it because, like the rest of your skin, it is constantly shedding  cells.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that washing your hair has no effect on the amount of oil produced by your sebaceous glands. This depends on hormonal and genetic factors, and the glands have no way of responding to oils on the surface of your scalp. The theory that you could \"train\" your scalp to be less oily was disproven in 1982 by [Kligman and Shelley](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13525782/).\n\nIf you're trying to avoid washing more frequently, then use a mixed boars bristle brush (BBB) to manipulate the scalp and softly remove cell build up. The Reddit page [No-Poo/Natural Hair](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/) is a good resource for advice on maintaining your scalp when shampooing less frequently. ​\n\n* *Signs you may be washing too much:* a scalp that feels dry or tight\n* *Signs you may not be washing enough:* ​excessive product/oil build up​\n\n**What is the proper way to shampoo?** \n\nTo help the shampoo work, emulsify it in your hands before applying. Start applying in at the back of your head, ending at the crown. Take around a minute to apply it. Similar to washing your hands, shampoo takes a few seconds to lift the oils and dirt.\n\n* *When you're looking for volume:* Pay attention to the sides and back of your head when shampooing and rinsing, as these areas are commonly missed. For thicker hair, consider washing (or rinsing) in two sections. If you've gone 3+ days without washing, shampooing twice also makes sense.\n* *When you're looking to smooth/leave natural oils behind:* Generally, use a minimal amount of shampoo and rinse it out fairly quickly. Try conditioning your hair first, then shampooing and conditioning again. See the \"volume\" bullet above if you feel like you need a deep clean. This is helpful but not always necessary.\n\n**Shampoo Ingredients**\n\nMany people search for shampoo via the phrase \"shampoo without chemicals\". Technically, if the shampoo has water in it this will count as a chemical, so a better approach is to search for shampoos via ingredients. I've given you a list to consider below. \n\n*Shampoo Without Silicone*\n\nSoluble silicone formulas can be washed out with gentler shampoos and conditioners that don't contain surfactants, and are capable of achieving the same results as non-soluble silicones. Common names on the bottle include:\n\n* *Non-solu​ble:* Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* ​*Soluble:* Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n*​Shampoo Without Sulfate and SLS*\n\nAs a rule of thumb, ingredients like Ammonium lauryl sulfate and Ammonium laureth sulfate tend to be easier on sensitive scalps than Sodium lauryl sulfate. To learn more about surfactants, check out [Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html). \n\n*Shampoo Without Parabens*​\n\nMost water based shampoos contain preservatives because without them they  will eventually grow mold or bacteria. Parabens are a type of preservative that are commonly used in hair products. According to The FDA \"scientists continue to review published studies on the safety of parabens. At this time, we do not have information showing that parabens, as they are used in cosmetics, have an effect on human health\" (Source: [FDA, Parabens in Cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/parabens-cosmetics)). They're usually easy to spot on the bottle because they end in the word \"paraben\". Common non-paraben preservatives are shown in the list below. To learn more about parabens, check out this article published by Cosmopolitan: [Wait, What Actually Are Parabens and Should You Avoid Them? ](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n* [*Common names on the bottle:* Midazolidinyl urea, Iodopropynyl, Isothiazolinone, and Sodium benzoate](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n*Shampoo Without Salt*\n\n[Sodium chloride](https://nutrafol.com/blog/15-shampoo-ingredients-to-avoid/) is another name for salt. It's used in shampoo and conditioner mainly to make the consistency thicker. A trend of \"salt shampoos\" has also been seen, where the benefits include being used as a [scrub](https://www.byrdie.com/what-are-salt-shampoos) for the scalp, plus being gentler on the environment. This has may have been influenced by the idea of adding [salt or sea water ](https://www.gourmandize.com/article-6582-put-salt-in-your-shampoo-to-solve-your-worst-hair-problems.htm)to your current shampoo. I wouldn't recommend adding sea water to your shampoo, as this could potentially generate bacteria and mold in your products over time. \n\n**Shampoo/Ingredients For Hair Care Concerns**\n\n*Hair Loss*\n\nFor assisting with hair loss, there are DHT-blocking shampoos plus ones with ingredients that help with inflammation. Saw palmetto, also known as [Serenoa](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/039463201202500435), naturally lowers the conversion of testosterone into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a sex hormone that contributes to human developments such as body hair, but it can also make you lose your hair faster and earlier. If you're experiencing any type of hair loss, the first place to start is with a doctor. You don't want to try different shampoos only to later find out a doctor would have pointed you in a different direction. \n\n*Hair Growth*\n\nShampoos with biotin are frequently marketed as being helpful for hair growth. It is also commonly added to shampoos claiming to reduce hair loss, but there is no [evidence](https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/does-biotin-really-prevent-hair-loss) that it prevents this. Consuming foods rich in healthy vitamins and minerals will help with overall hair health.\n\n*Dry Scalp*\n\nSome contributing factors to a dry or itchy scalp can't be solved with a shampoo. However, certain ingredients can offer relief.\n\n* ​​*Salicylic acid:* This can be found in drug store shampoos advertising scalp health. It will help remove scalp cells causing dandruff while also moisturizing dry spots. Consider using it seasonally during dry winter months, or on a regular basis as needed. \n* *Selenium sulfide:* Formulated to control more serious dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. It's also used to treat pityriasis versicolour, a common fungal infection that causes small patches of skin to become scaly and discoloured.\n* *Ketoconazole:* An ingredient that provides the same benefits as Selenium sulfide.\n* *Tea Tree Oil:* [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360273/) have shown that tea tree oil effectively fights many types of bacteria, viruses and fungi. These shampoos tend to be very calming and cleansing.\n\n*Naturally Grey Hair Turning Yellow* \n\nUse two types of shampoo: (1) a purple shampoo and (2) a moisturizing shampoo. Grey hair tends to pick up unwanted yellow tones from the environment, and purple shampoo will help combat these tones. The moisturizing shampoo helps prevent your hair from becoming too dry, which can be exacerbated by purple shampoo. Check out [Purple Shampoo](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-purple-shampoo.html) for more insight on your options for these products. ",

Google gives shopping results for the same shampoo costing £8.99 online. Some shops only have the 280ml tubes but they’re still £1 and still an amazing deal (vs £5 250ml SLS free shampoo in boots).\n\nI definitely notice less fading on my vibrant dyed hair since I re-dyed and switched entirely to the cucumber one from other shampoos, though the stuff can be difficult to lather as it doesn’t foam, and it’s so thick it just will not go through the pop up cap in the 500ml bottle. I expect some people wouldn’t like this (I just unscrew the cap, whatever, it was £1). \n\nImages (request desktop site on mobile to read ingredients): https://imgur.com/a/xygk1qb\n\nCompare with the prices at\n\nhttps://www.fragrancedirect.co.uk/yes-to-cucumber-colour-protection-shampoo-500ml-0075028.html\n\nhttps://www.lookfantastic.com/yes-to-blueberries-smooth-and-shine-shampoo-for-frizzy-hair-280ml/11353835.html\n\nSO. It’s definitely worth making a couple of rounds of your local poundlands and other cheapo discount stores every so often to see what random cosmetics they’ve got for insanely cheap.\n\n——\n\nPossible decent alternative: a few poundlands currently have 250ml “dubble trubble” kids shampoo, these use ammonium lauryl sulfate rather than SL(E)S which is a larger molecule and gentler foaming agent. I’ve seen both 200ml\\* tubes for £1 in Poundland and 500ml bottles (for £4.99) of the same stuff in TK maxx today, so guessing this is another random overstock thing. Haven’t tried these yet as I only have so much hair to wash, but I expect they’ll foam *somewhat*, maybe a good compromise for anyone who does not enjoy zero foam.\n\nSome images with ingredients: https://imgur.com/a/aRfgjT2\n\nSame stuff bought directly is £4 https://www.danielgalvinjunior.com/product/dubble-trubble-cucumber-shampoo-bodywash-2/\n\nThere’s also a Vosene branded one using sodium trideceth sulfate which I personally hadn’t heard of before, major supermarkets (e.g. Tesco) apparently sell this brand too.\n\nIn general it’s probably also worth looking for kids shampoos/bodywashes and 2in1s as a much cheaper non-SL(E)S alternative or a good in-between.\n\n\nEDIT: sorry, the blueberry one contains Sodium Coco Sulphate, which is also a foaming agent. Internet hasn't decided how bad that one is in comparison to the others.",

So here goes, and sorry bc it's a long one: \n\n*the alcohols to be concerned about in skin-care products are \n\nethanol, \n\ndenatured alcohol, \n\nethyl alcohol, \n\nmethanol, \n\nisopropyl alcohol, \n\nSD alcohol, and \n\nbenzyl alcohol (when it’s among the main ingredients; tiny amounts aren't a problem). \n\nthese types can be extremely drying and irritating to skin, as well as capable of generating free radical damage and disrupting skin's protective barrier.\n\nsome companies use cleansing agents (a type of ingredient) that can be so drying and irritating. the biggest culprits to avoid in a face wash are:\n\nsodium palm kernelate,\n\npotassium hydroxide,\n\nsodium hydroxide\n\nsodium cocoate\n\nsodium lauryl sulfate\n\nTEA-lauryl sulfate\n\nsodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate\n\nsodium palmate\n\nthere are so many good cleansing agents, too many to list, but heres some common ones that are good to see in your first few ingredients…\n\nlaurie acid\n\npalmitic acid\n\nisohexadecane\n\nammonium lauryl sulfate\n\nsodium laureth sulfate\n\nsodium laureth-13 carboxylate\n\ndisodium cocoyl glutamate\n\nglyceryl behanate\n\npotassium cetyl phosphate\n\nPEG-10 rapeseed sterol\n\nsoapwort\n\nsodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\npolysorbate 20\n\ndisodium lauraminopropionate\n\nsodium myreth sulfate\n\nlaureth-7\n\ncocamidopropyl betaine\n\nammonium laureth sulfate\n\nsodium methyl taurate\n\nsteareth-20\n\nmagnesium oleth sulfate*",

I originally looked into them because they asked me to be their spokesperson and, as I do with everything, I began doing my research and realized not only did I not agree with their product ingredients, their marketing made them look like they were doing something positive when really they put lots of toxins into their ingredients. When I said this to them they didn't respond to me. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the consumers to do their research, but I wanted to put it out there since I know that Lush is one company that I can say with confidence that I do not support. I'm all about products that don't have packaging, but not at the expense of my health or the health of the environment. For this reason, I do not recommend shopping at Lush Cosmetics North America\nYou can have effective cosmetics without ANY toxic chemicals or ingredients.\n. \nLush uses toxic and synthetic ingredients and are not sustainable. Some of their toxic ingredients to name a few to look out for and stay away from: propylene glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate, Hydroxycitronellal, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Alkyl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, lilial, alpha-isomethyl ionone, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, glycerin... all of these ingredients are in their products.\nThey list their synthetic ingredients on their website and use petrochemicals, SLS, other sulfates, and synthetic fragrance. Before you purchase products, be sure to look at the ingredient lists.\nThat company really makes me sad because they trick people into thinking they are doing something good, when really they sell products with toxic ingredients. https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder They say \"Our fragrances are made up of approximately 60% natural oils, resins and absolutes.\" which means at least 40% of their ingredients are not natural and they don't state what their \"perfume\" or \"fragrance\" is.\nIf you are wondering about ingredients, look them up. I always love ewg.org as a resource.\n\nI can see on this subreddit the popularity of Lush because of their package free products. I love their products as well so I find this a little upsetting from Lauren. As you can see from the post, she seems to put down one company to promote her own shop and products which screams suspicion and \"holier than thou\" to me. She is also getting some fair critique on her stance as well.\n\nPersonally, I have never seen Lush advertise their products as 100% all natural, but \"Fresh Handmade Cosmetics\" and they have always clearly stated what is synthetic and what is natural in each of their products. (I don't know where that rumour came about).\n\nAlso, what does she mean by toxic? Everything can be toxic at a certain amount, but of course we need to also be conscious of the environment and not everything synthetic is particularly bad for the environment. I will continue to use Lush because I don't think that ALL their products are bad when you can research the ingredients yourself and make an informed decision. Lush has always promoted sustainability for their products and donating money from their profits to charitable costs to both fair trade workers and the environment. This, I believe, is 100% better than 90% of the cosmetic market. At least they are using most fresh fruit and oils instead of chemicals! \n\nWhat are your thoughts? I'd love to have this conversation with the rest of you as Lauren is a big voice in this community. ",

But I can make it to their store without driving, the products I enjoy are effective and package free, and at the end of the day, I don't have any more mentally capacity to stress about the quality of my attempt to do a good deed.\n\nI don't think we should be spending our time bashing companies that don't align 100% to our vision of a perfect example. We should spend our time applauding the parts that people get right while campaigning the brands we enjoy to improve. Ultimately, when someone sees me with a muslin bag of shampoo bars, the conversation I get to have about a still seemingly radical idea is far more important to me than the tradeoffs I made by using this product.",

Even Lauren’s own Simply Co laundry detergent is never in stock (or hasn’t actually been sold online yet). A lot of other products on Package Free Shop’s online store are frequently unavailable.

I deal with large, clogged pores and lots of sebaceous filaments. Over the years I've tried innumerable cleansers and creams and treatments (some great, some terrible for my skin).  \n\nThis cleanser is pretty interesting and kind of fun to use. It comes out as a gel that you massage onto your dry face. For two minutes, while you leave it alone, it bubbles and foams by itself. It's pretty ticklish and entertaining. After 2 minutes, you massage it back down into your face, rinse with lukewarm water, and pat dry. \n\nI was a little skeptical that it would really cleanse off my makeup, but it actually does an amazing job. My skin feels clean and tight (but not in a bad way). In the past few days, I've noticed a remarkable reduction in oil production (I only have to blot once around midday and I *could* get away with skipping that and embracing the \"healthy glow\" if I wasn't so obsessed with a matte appearance) and my pores appear to be tightening back up, shrinking if you will. I've had no new irritations or breakouts and the ones that were healing appear to be healing a little faster than normal. I use it morning and night and for the first time in my life, when I wake up, my skin isn't oily. I'm all around astounded and I really just needed a place to gush (none of my guy friends really care all that much about the goos I put on my face). \n\nHave any of you tried this or any other Asian cleansers? How did it/they work out for you? Anything anyone knows that I should be worried about using this product (I'm always waiting for something awful to ruin the good things lol)? \n\nUpdate -\n\nIngredients: Water, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide DEA, Methyl Perfluorobutyl Ether, Methyl Perfluoroisobutyl Ether, Ethyl Perfluorobutyl Ether, Ethyl Perfluoroisobutyl Ether, Polyhydroxystearic Acid/Isononyl Isononanoate/Ethylhexyl Isononanoate/Sodium cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium chloride Phosphate, PGE-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Butelyn Glycol, Maackia Faureie Stem Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Simmondsia Chinensis (jojoba) Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Persea Graitssima (avocado) Oil, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Opuntia Ficus-India Extract, Sansevieria Trifasciata Leaf Extract, Punaca Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica (fig) Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginko Biloba Nut Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalus (Rosemary) Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Extract, Rose Canina Fruit Extract, Salvia Hispanica Seed Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Xantham Gum \n\nI know a lot of people cry out against Lavender Oil because they heard it was cytotoxic (I was one of them until I started *reading* about the issue). I'm pretty certain the scare has to do with a misinterpretation of research. Lavender Oil was found to be cytotoxic *in vitro* to endothelium cells (lining the interior of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels) and fibroblasts. A 2005 study states: \"although it was recently reported that lavender oil, and its major constituent linalyl acetate, are toxic to human skin cells in vitro, contact dermatitis to lavender oil appears to occur at only a very low frequency. The relevance of this in vitro toxicity to dermatological application of Lavandula oils remains unclear.\" And in 2007 a team of European researchers testing photosensitivity in relation to lavender oil and sandalwood oil found: \"Lavender oil and sandalwood oil did not induce photohaemolysis in our test system. However, a few reports on photosensitivity reactions due to these substances have been published, e.g. one patient with persistent light reaction and a positive photo-patch test to sandalwood oil.\" So, please, spare me the diatribes about how \"terrible\" Lavender Oil is. I used to give them. And I was as misinformed as anyone else. ",

    "body": "So I'm asking this with regards to claims I've seen online that ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS) is less irritating than sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).\n\nThe website I see claiming this says that because the ALS molecule is larger and more complex:  \"it is more difficult for ALS molecules to penetrate the outer layers of the skin and so reach the delicate underlying layers of cells.\" - https://www.greenpeople.co.uk/blogs/the-beauty-hub/faq-als-vs-sls\n\nThey cite no sources, and I'm skeptical. I'm wondering if anyone can let me know if my basic understanding makes sense or if I'm missing something:\n\nWhen added to water, ALS and SLS both dissolve into their anion and cation components - ammonium and sodium are the respective cations, and the lauryl sulfate group is the anion for both.\n\nThe anion is what actually acts as a detergent - the negatively charged portion of the ion is hydrophillic, and the long tail is hydrophobic. Again, this is the same for both SLS and ALS - the LS group is the anionic surfactant.\n\nGiven this, the claim that the \"smaller molecule\" of SLS vs ALS allows more irritation due to it penetrating the skin further seems dubious. Not to mention, ammonium ions are not a huge amount larger than sodium ions from what I have been able to find (effective 1.5 Å vs. 1.2 Å) - and the size of the anion LS dwarfs both anyway.\n\nSo given this - is the claim of the blog above nonsense? Is just their reasoning wrong but the claim (SLS is more irritating) correct?\n\nI could see other reasons ALS might be less irritating - for example, does one of SLS or ALS dissolve more completely and release more anionic detergent vs the other? Or does the ammonium ion in ALS lower the pH and help reduce irritation that way? Something else going on?\n\nAny comments from someone with knowledge of detergent chemistry is greatly appreciated!",

I can't tell you the difference between how these two surfactants interact with the skin, but I can tell you what I do know about detergents. As the other commenter noted, it's very difficult for substances to penetrate our skin, it's built to keep harmful things out of our bodies and keep our organs inside. If someone's natural skin barrier is already compromised by using too many irritating actives, or from an infection or something, it's more sensitive to irritants. The skin's inflammation response (increased blood flow, swelling, expressing more sebum) is doing more of the heavy lifting to protect the body because the acid mantle isn't available.\n\n\nFormulation matters; because anionic surfactants are so efficient at cleansing, and potentially irritating, the formulators will almost always add a very low amount of the anionic surfactant and add other types of co-surfactants to help achieve the desired foam, emulsification, and any other benefits of adding surfactants to the formula. They can also do other things with the formula to reduce the potential for irritation like adding anti-inflammatory ingredients and adjusting the pH. So the presence of a specific surfactant in a formula doesn't guarantee that the formula overall will have the properties of that surfactants or any other ingredient in the formula.",

I have an oily scalp that requires frequent washing, but I can't seem to find a shampoo that doesn't dry out my hair (and isn't loaded with oils either).  \n\nMy current shampoo is the Zarqa every day shampoo with Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate. It has aloe vera so I thought that would make it less drying, but nope still too harsh. Before this I used Dermolin with Sodium Laureth Sulfate, but that was too drying for me as well. \n\nI hope someone can help me 🙏",

    "body": "Original post in Ask Chemistry - posting here on suggestion that maybe some cosmetic chemists have some thoughts on the \"why\" of SLS vs ALS irritation.\n\nOne update I've found since my original post is that the water solubility between SLS and ALS is actually somewhat different, based on the critical micellar concentration from an Australian report:\n( https://cdnservices.industrialchemicals.gov.au/statements/EVA00116%20-%20Evaluation%20Statement%20-%2022%20December%202022.pdf ) \n\n\n\"The water solubility value reported (2367 mg/L at 25°C (exp.)) is equal to the critical micelle concentration (CMC), as is  appropriate for surface-active substances. The CMC of the other chemicals in this group  ranges from 722 milligrams per litre (mg/L, 30°C, exp.) for magnesium dodecyl sulfate, to  1746 mg/L (25°C, exp.) for ammonium dodecyl sulfate, and 2375 mg/L (40°C, exp.) for  potassium dodecyl sulfate (Mukerjee and Mysels 1971).\"\n\nCould this CMC difference explain why one ingredient is more irritating than the other? Ie - more SLS dissolves before micelles start forming, if I'm understanding correctly?\n\nOriginal post:\n\nSo I'm asking this with regards to claims I've seen online that ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS) is less irritating than sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).\n\nThe website I see claiming this says that because the ALS molecule is larger and more complex: \"it is more difficult for ALS molecules to penetrate the outer layers of the skin and so reach the delicate underlying layers of cells.\" - https://www.greenpeople.co.uk/blogs/the-beauty-hub/faq-als-vs-sls\n\nThey cite no sources, and I'm skeptical. I'm wondering if anyone can let me know if my basic understanding makes sense or if I'm missing something:\n\nWhen added to water, ALS and SLS both dissolve into their anion and cation components - ammonium and sodium are the respective cations, and the lauryl sulfate group is the anion for both.\n\nThe anion is what actually acts as a detergent - the negatively charged portion of the ion is hydrophillic, and the long tail is hydrophobic. Again, this is the same for both SLS and ALS - the LS group is the anionic surfactant.\n\nGiven this, the claim that the \"smaller molecule\" of SLS vs ALS allows more irritation due to it penetrating the skin further seems dubious. Not to mention, ammonium ions are not a huge amount larger than sodium ions from what I have been able to find (effective 1.5 Å vs. 1.2 Å) - and the size of the anion LS dwarfs both anyway.\n\nSo given this - is the claim of the blog above nonsense? Is just their reasoning wrong but the claim (SLS is more irritating) correct?\n\nI could see other reasons ALS might be less irritating - for example, does one of SLS or ALS dissolve more completely and release more anionic detergent vs the other? Or does the ammonium ion in ALS lower the pH and help reduce irritation that way? Something else going on?\n\nAny comments from someone with knowledge of detergent chemistry is greatly appreciated!",

        "body": "So part of the irritation will be how good of a surfactant a molecule actually is. We usually measure this by determining the effect a molecule has on the surface tension of the air-water interface (because it's easy), although you can argue that studying the oil-water interface is a more useful practice (but harder to do).\n\nSince air is more hydrophobic than water, we can use that as a proxy for understanding how surfactants behave. Surfactants will populate the air-water interface long before micelles form. And micelle production is really a byproduct of lack of space at the air-water interface. So CMC isn't really useful as it's doesn't really tell us how quickly or by how much the surfactant changes the surface tension--direct measurements of how strong of a surfactant they are \n\nWhile this depends both on the head group and the tail group, the ionization of the head group is also important. A lot of claims about gentleness come down to modifying the surfactant properties at the oil-water interface, which is completely formula dependent. This includes contributions from surfactant packing and head group ionization. \n\nWhile both surfactants would pack similarly when ionized completely (in solution), they don't ionize completely in micelles or at the densely-padked air-water interface (and presumably at the oil-water interface either). \n\nSodium ions are smaller and harder than ammonium ions, ammonium ions actually are more similar to K+ ions, when considering hydration radius.\n\n But the ion chemistry matters too. Ammonium ions will be slightly acidic and lower the pH slightly. If you don't pH adjust products, SDS will appear more irritating simply from a pH perspective. \n\nI'm not sure about the apparent ionization from the sulfate. My guess is that ammonium might not ionize as readily away from the sulfate group as sodium (although only 30% or so of SDS molecules are ionized within micelles, anyway, so this may play a minor part).\n\nThe actual quantification of what makes a surfactant seem gentle or not largely depends on formulations. Since many bulk surfactants are sold without pH adjustments, I think this plays a larger role in how something is perceived. So degree of ionization will also affect basicity, too. \n\nI think it's actually a pretty complicated topic that is poorly researched overall. Even quantifying these values of apparent ionization is difficult, too, and usually requires some kind of electromobility measurements.",

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types.

    "body": "I'm back to this, having tried a couple of shampoos on the market and having narrowed it down to what each effects my scalp/face the most, in any way. Fyi, i use oil control shampoos as a counter for excessive sebum.\n\n**To start off i've noticed that some specific shampoos, f.e some H&S ones, with similar ingredients in them, tend to be more aggrevvating towards rosacea and they usually leave a flared up feeling post wash that can last, depending on how serious your rosacea is. However, they tend to be more effective towards acne (if you also have that) and dandruff.**\n\n* *Example 1-> Product: Head & Shoulders Deep Cleanse For Oily Scalp*\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Parfum, Piroctone Olamine, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-10, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Limonene, Sodium Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Citrus Limon Fruit Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, CI 42090*\n\n**Other shampoos like the le petit marseillais one** **(or gen ones that are more eco) with very different ingredients in it and missing the most well known trigger ingredients, is more friendly towards rosacea. I did notice that, post using it, my hair look more thin, shedding and thats a bit worrying. (placebo?!)**\n\n*Example 2->Product: Le Petit Marseillais w/ Thyme and White Clay*\n\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Thymus Vulgaris Extract, Kaolin, Polyquaternium-10, Glycol Distearate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n**P.S: Ingredients that can trigger rosacea flare ups, quoting AAD:**\n\n* *Alcohol*\n* *Camphor*\n* *Fragrance*\n* *Glycolic acid*\n* *Lactic acid*\n* *Menthol*\n* *Sodium lauryl sulfate (often found in shampoos)*\n* *Urea*\n\nThere's also shampoos that belong to an in between category, having slightly different ingredients in them, but i do notice that, thus far, none of them are as friendly as an eco shampoo which doesn't have the same ingredients as a H&S one, or has them in a very low percent.\n\nThis makes sense as ingredients that trigger rosacea when applied to the face straight away, can be effective when applying them to your hair/scalp which is a continuation of your face contact area. You can mitigate the consequences by avoiding shampoo run down your face/wash well post shampoo etc...\n\nYou can drop your recommendations below as well as the ingredients involved in the products you use.",

I had used suave in the past and the one with the ammonium lauryl sulfate seemed ok, but they recently changed the formula, and I had a bad reaction to it.\n\nGenerally though I avoid sulfates because they can make my scalp very itchy and it will bleed. Some sulfates seem worse than others, in the past ammonium lauryl sufate can be ok if I use it sparingly. I also know now to avoid silicones which can build up. I also avoid itchy ms, because I have rashes and itchiness to them.\n\nI'm still having trouble with greasiness. I have fine hair that gets greasy by the end of the day. I was a daily washer for a long time, could not get away with every other day. Had tried a bunch of things before this, someone told me to wash it less, like 1-2x per week, because the scalp will produce less oil. I started washing it twice a week, then cut down to once a week. I've stuck with it for at least a couple years now, and it doesn't get any less greasy. \n\nI'm at the point where I hate both touching and washing my hair and wear it tucked under a hat all the time. We also have terrible water pressure in my building, the water cuts out several times when I shower and it takes 3-5 minutes for it to come back on. My hair is long and fine and takes a while to wash. I hate washing it. \n\nLately it seems like it's impossible to get all the grease out, so wash my hair 3-4 times in the shower, it takes about an hour to accomplish this. I use more shampoo, I use less shampoo, I water down the shampoo. I use combinations of different shampoos. I tried conditioning first before shampooing. Nothing seems to get it all out. \n\nI've also tried dunking my hair in a bucket of water, or washing it under the bathtub tap, because our water pressure from the shower is terrible. It seems no matter how much I rinse I see suds in the water. \n\nThis month I've tried using sulfate shampoo 2 weeks in a row just to get a reset and try the cg method again. Now my hair is both very dry and very greasy, and knotting up. \n\nI really don't know what to do! I'm trying to give my hair a clean start, and I can't seem to find any shampoos that work. I'm trying to find something that does a good job of getting out grease and rinses out well, that doesn't weigh down fine hair, given the water pressure in my building is poor.",

        "body": "Depends on what you mean by related. They are related as far as chemical structure goes, but not necessarily in the way they will effect your skin. Both sodium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate are hydrocarbon chains attached to an oxygen molecule, which in turn attaches to a sulfur. The sulfur molecule is attached to a total of 4 oxygen molecules. Two of them are double bonded to the sulfur, the third oxygen is the one also bound to the hydrocarbon chain, and the fourth is bound with a single bond to the sulfur. This gives the fourth oxygen a negative charge. This is where the similarity between sodium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate end. In a SLS molecule, a positively charged sodium ion is attracted to the negatively charged oxygen. In an ALS molecule, an ammonium ion is attracted to the negatively charged oxygen. This difference gives them different chemical properties. That means that one might irritate your skin while the other might not. [Here](http://cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php) you can see that ALS and SLS have different acne and irritant ratings.",

So I decided to try a shampoo containing ammonium lauryl sulfate and ammonium laureth sulfate, despite knowing sulfates are notorious in skin care circles for causing breakouts. (I also started using an SLES-containing but fragrance free hand wash as a face wash while I wait for my next bottle of face wash to arrive). I thought maybe it's true how some say the comedogenic scale is overrated (SLS and SLES are rated 5 and 3 on the comedogenic scale, respectively) and maybe I shouldn't fear sulfates if they can prevent me from suffering from glucosides.  \n\nWell, I discovered sulfates make my scalp and face breakout in a bunch of painful pustules and papules. But I also know that sulfates are considered to \"strip\" the skin.  \n\nSo I'm wondering, what is the mechanism that causes sulfates to be comedogenic (at least for some people)? Does it truly clog pores? Or does its drying and irritating nature disrupt the skin barrier to then cause breakouts? Just trying to understand how it works.  \n\nThank you and Happy Holidays!",

    "body": "Long story short I've been trying to figure out my skin for years now. I have oily/combination acne prone skin with large pores. I get a lot of CCs, clogged pores, SFs. I also suffer from dermatitis around my nose/mouth/chin which I believe to be a side effect of my Tretinoin Gel. I'm not 100% sure exactly which ingredients are causing my breakouts so I'm trying to eliminate the most common comedogenic ingredients from my routine. \n\nSome ingredients that are a definite no for me are: Any oil. Silicones especially DIMETHICONE. Coconut derivatives (i.e Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides). Fatty Alcohols/acids. and pretty much anything rated higher than a 1 on the comedogenic scale. \n\nProducts with Propylene/ Pentylene glycol and butylene glycol are ok. \n\nIt's really hard to find any products that lack all these things (especially coconut derived ingredients) \n\nMy current products: \n\nFace cleaners: Homemade face powder (Oatmeal flour/kaolin clay/ brown rice flour) or Chagrin Valley Adzuki Micrograin Facial Scrub. (Was using BioDerma Sensibo Micellar water but unsure about the Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides in it) \n\nSerum: Timeless Skincare Hyaluronic acid serum \n\nTreatment: Clindamycin Gel/ Tretinoin gel. ( I want to switch to the Tretinoin Micro as the generic gel is filled with alcohols and very drying.)\n\nMoisturizer: SebaMed clear face gel (love this, although not the most moisturizing) \n\nSPF: none. I can't find one yet :( \n\nMask: Aztec Secret clay Mask with apple cider vinegar. \n\nExfoliant: Stridex Red box (using occasionally because I’m unsure about the Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate and simethicone) \n\nIf anyone has any recommendations or additional products I'd love to find a non powder cleanser,  additional moisturizer or moisturizing serum, eye cream/gel, a body wash, body lotion, maybe even a gradual tanner or self tanner....",

    "body": "Hi, /r/curlyhair!  Long time lurker, first time poster!  I got these two products as a Christmas gift and used them for a few months before I decided to buckle down and write a review.  Here goes, please feel free to ask any questions!  \n\n**Basic Info** \n\nLeonor Greyl is a luxury natural hair care line.  I personally am a sucker for high-end products so I had to try these.  The shampoo/conditioners I usually use are the Cristalliste line from Kerastase (the pink bottles).  My hair is naturally 3B but I flat iron 1-2 times a week at most and rock it curly otherwise.  \n\nLeonor Greyl has a whole line of different products but the two I will be reviewing are the **Shampooing Reviviscence – Deep Repairing Shampoo for Damaged Hair and the Masque Orchidee — Conditioning Mask for Thick, Dry Hair**\n \n**Shampoo info:** Deep repairing shampoo for dehydrated, colored, damaged and brittle hair. This luxurious shampoo reconditions and restructures the most damaged hair, thus regaining strength and vitality, manageability, shine and softness.\n\n**Mask info:** Silk proteins, vegetal ceramids and oils work together to smooth, detangle, protect and restructure hair fiber. Leaves hair soft and manageable.\n\n\n**Ingredients** (as listed on product):\n\n**Shampoo:** Aqua, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-40 Glyceryl Cocoate, Sodium Coceth sulphate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl dimethylaminohydroxypropyl hydrolysed collagen, Hydrolysed Quinoa, Limonium latifolium, Fucus Vesiculosus Extract, Hydrolysed Silk, Bambusa vulgaris Extract, Myristamine Oxide, Polyquaternium-47, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-33, Quaternium-91, Cetrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-15 Cocopolyamine, Lauryl Dimethyl Amine Oxide, Parfum (Fragrance), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Cereus Grandiflorus (Cactus) Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Lactic Acid, Guar, droxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Daucus Carota Extract, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Limonene, Linalool, Geraniol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional\n\n**Mask:** Aqua, Methylheptyl Isostearate, Adipic Acid/Diethylene Glycol/Glycerin Crosspolymer, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamide MEA, Buxus Chinesis Seed Oil, PEG-15 Cocopolyamine, Orchis Maculata Flower Extract, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Sericin, Parfum (Fragrance), Ceteareth-33, Jojoba Wax PEG-120 Esters, Butyrospermum Parkii, Lauryl Dimethyl Amine Oxide,\nElaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, Hydrolysed Silk, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Triticum Vulgare,\nTrietanolamine, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Price**\n\nSuggested retail for the shampoo is $67 (!) and the mask is $62.  Both are 200 mL (6.8 oz).  I've seen it online on Amazon for cheaper though.  Good thing this was a gift!  \n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nStore retailers are available on Leonor Greyl's website but there are several online retailers that sell this, such as Amazon, Doobop, etc.  \n\n**How to Use**\n\nFor the shampoo, you are supposed to lather and leave it in your hair for 5-minutes before rinsing out.  The mask can be used like a regular conditioner or you can leave it in your hair for 5-minutes if you want to do light conditioning, or 20-minutes for a deep treatment.\n\n**Pros**\n\nAfter the first month or so of using it once a week I noticed a bit of a difference.  My hair felt soft after I washed with these products and it didn't feel stripped.  The shampoo lathers pretty well and the mask spreads really nicely on my hair.  It's like butter.  Curls looked more well-defined.  \n\n**Cons**\n\nThe price.  The smell.  Oh dear lord, the shampoo smells like old ladies.  Consistency of the shampoo is really weird, too.  Maybe I got a bad bottle but it was like some solid stuff mixed in with liquid stuff.  I have to shake the bottle when I get it out and [this](http://i.imgur.com/mEnHADU.jpg) was what it looks like.  The bottle also opens from the bottom so as soon as I opened it the first few times the flood gates opened and all this watery shampoo poured out that I didn't need.  The mask doesn't smell as strongly as the shampoo does but it's pretty pricey, too.\n\n**Overall**\n\nIn my opinion these products were not worth the money.  Considering the price, the amount of product I got, and its performance, I'd rather spend my money on something else.  Without a doubt, these products would be good as a step up from using something like, say, from the drugstore.  The products I was using already were pretty high-end to begin with so it was like a lateral (or dare I say a step down) shift for me.  \n\nIf you're looking to step up from drugstore stuff then check out Ouidad.  If you're using mid-range stuff and are in the market for something HE then go with Kerastase.  \n\nThat being said, don't be discouraged just because of my review!  They have a sampler set on their website you can try if you feel so inclined.  \n\nI really wanted to like these products but I just can't.  Very disappointing but I'm glad I was able to try them.

I was looking on my moms Pinterest acct and YouTube and found tons of healthy ways to try getting rid of acne. Try minimizing to a very simple gentle face wash like cetaphil, something for non acne. Watch videos about apple cider vinegar for acne, it can possibly be a miracle worker. Also read about aloe Vera, also a miracle worker. A face mask I recommend is using an egg with cinnamon, it burns but is very effective if you face doesn't react bad to cinnamon. Just some tips :)",

However, after reading through the sidebar a hundred times and searching all of the previous posts, I'm concerned that my routine is damaging to my skin.\n\n*Please note that 6-7ish months ago I had a very severe allergic reaction on my face (NOT fun) and I believe, after much trial and error, that it was caused by my skin hating anything soy derived. A lot of the HG items on skincareaddiciton I've tried had to be ruled out because of it.*\n\n**Routine from Feb-May**\n1. Remove make-up and massage skin with 100% Mineral Oil (the kind you get at Bed, Bath, and Beyond that's labeled \"Snow River\" Oil)\n\n2. Wash with a dime-sized amount of Alaffia Authentic African Black Soap (Unscented). *Ingredients: Ocimum canum (African Mint) Aqueous Extract, Saponified Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) Butter and Elaeis guineensis (Palm Kernel) Oil, Lauryl Glucoside*\n\n3. Pat face dry or air dry\n\n4. Swipe on Noxzema Triple Clean Anti-Blemish Pads. *Ingredients: Alcohol denat, water(aqua EAU), PEG-4, PPG-11, stearyl ether, fragrance (parfum), eugenol, linalool, limonene, geraniol, benzyl benaoate, disodium EDTA, cinnamal, citral*\n\nNo moisturizer. No sunscreen. I would love to use them (I've got several in my bathroom) but they all break me out terribly because of the soy content. I'm trying to get the cleaning routine down (nice and slow - yay) before I can finish out my beauty regimen.\n\n10 days ago, I ran out of my Noxzema pads and decided to give the Stridex Red Box a try. I thought that hey, I've already been using a 2% salicylic acid, another should work just fine. Besides, the Noxzema burns my skin a little when I use it (though that goes away quickly). Here are the inactive ingredients for Stridex: Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA\n\nNow go figure, I'm breaking out. I don't think it's purging because I rarely break out on my forehead, and now I have 3 new pimples in my hairline.\n\nFor reference, here is my photo journey since February: http://imgur.com/a/rGMfa\n\n**NEED HELP**\n\n1. Is the (probably terribly high) pH of the black soap doing irreparable damage? Or is the BHA afterwards helping with the pH of my skin?\n\n2. If the answer to #1 is \"Yes, get rid of that soap crap\", then what do I do for a cleanser? OCM doesn't work well for me without a cleanser afterwards (tried other oils, and I must stick to Mineral Oil). I've considered trying washing with oatmeal or honey...both of which I used during my allergy attack.\n\n3. Noxzema vs Stridex? The first burns when I use it, but my face stays clear. The second is gentle, but causes me to break out. Or do I ditch both for something else? (Keep in mind that pesky soy issue)\n\n========\n\nFor reference, I can't (usually) use products with the following ingredients because they are/usually are derived from soy: glycerin, glycols, xanthan gum, tocopherol acetate/vitamin e, lecithin, argan oil, and (duh) anything with the word \"soy\" in it",

If so you should be squeaky clean without actually being squeaky (tight)\n\n- What BHA? I see drying alcohol and a pile of fragrance ingredients?\n\nThe problem you may encounter is between the alkaline soap and the massive amount of alcohol in the pads is that your acid mantle/ beneficial flora, and probably some of the horny layer are likely to be badly damaged. Basically the entire skin barrier may well be decimated. You may well have a rebound breakout as the bad guys repopulate faster than the good guys. :/\n\nNo idea what you can use without glycerin, other than DIY. Never heard anyone say they avoid that with a soy allergy. You can purchase water soluble salicylic acid from Skin Essential Actives, presumably other ingredients suppliers.\n\nIt will be a cold day in hell before I advocate a product with ALS and fragrance. I didn't know Stridex had ALS so that is two TILs for me today.",

That's how I further confirmed that shea butter doesn't work for me, but it was super easy to make and I'm planning on looking for another butter to try.\n\nI have not found a cleanser I can use after OCM, so I wipe off with cotton wipes from CVS then rinse with water. I have found that I can break out from an oil that doesn't work for me as well as from not moisturizing enough (which is why I'm trying to figure out a homemade moisturizer). I have given up for the moment on looking for a cleanser for after OCM and, I think I have a new exfoliant on order, but until I get a new moisturizer working for me, I can't start a new exfoliant.\n\nI don't have much advice for you beyond the obvious, probably going back to the Noxzema if you liked the clear skin despite the burning. However, I recommend finding a moisturizer, though I understand it may be difficult. Thanks for the info on glycerin and glycols. I knew they were made from vegetables, but I had assumed they were usually corn and coconut.\n\nWhat do you use for shampoo and conditioner?

    "body": "[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ge6k5/a_fresh_towel_on_your_pillow_didnt_cure_your_acne/c1mxjr0) comment interested me a lot. \n\nI get most of my acne on the sides of my face, as described in the comment. However, I'm confused because he says that acne roseacea appears mainly on the side of one's face, but Wikipedia tells me that it appears mainly on the front of one's face. Can anyone back up what he says, or help me understand?\n\nI've been using a face wash with salicylic acid for a long time, and it hasn't made a dent. I've quit milk and started changing my pillowcase every night a few months ago, and that made a little difference, but barely. I was on an antibiotic (tetracycline) for awhile, too, but there wasn't any difference, so my doctor took me off of it. I also have several inflamed lymph nodes on the sides of my neck and under my chin.\n\nAn interesting thing about the sodium lauryl sulfate that may or may not be relevant. I was using a toothpaste with SLS, and got horrible mouth sores all the time. Due to some advice from the internet, I switched to Sensodyne (no SLS) and my mouth sores are gone.\n\nDo you think switching to shampoos/soaps without sodium/ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, or salicylic acid would make a difference? Is it worth it to give it a go?\n\nI think I will try switching detergents too, as described in the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ge6k5/a_fresh_towel_on_your_pillow_didnt_cure_your_acne/) linked to earlier.\n\n*postscript*: I also sent this in a PM to [kindofstephen](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/do7s4/iama_skincare_expertformulator_and_would_like_to/) 8 hours ago, so I'm waiting for a response from him too.",

Well, to help you I have listed [what should sensitive skin avoid](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7960865782616622075/1316533852236492673#)? Then why are you waiting for?

If you have a normal skin type or any other skin type like oily or dry skin, it will be a great decision to avoid them. \n\n  \n\n\nLet me come to a point! Before buying any type of skincare product be sure to check its ingredients. If your skin care products contain any of the below-mentioned ingredients. Then it is the perfect time to ditch them and choose the[ best products for sensitive skin](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7960865782616622075/1316533852236492673#).\n\nThese are some of the important ingredients that should be avoided before buying any type of skincare products.\n\n* Benzalkonium chloride\n* SD Alcohol (also known as denatured alcohol)\n* Camphor\n* Ammonia\n* Arnica\n* Balsam\n* Bergamot\n* Citrus juices and oils\n* Cinnamon\n* Balm mint\n* Clove\n* Coriander\n* Clover blossom\n* Ammonia\n* Ethanol\n* Eucalyptus\n* Eugenol\n* Fennel\n* Fennel oil\n* Fir needle\n* Fragrance\n* Geranium\n* Grapefruit\n* Horsetail\n* Isoeugenol\n* Lavender\n* Lemon\n* Lime\n* Linalool\n* Essential oils\n* Melissa (lemon balm)\n* Menthol\n* Sandalwood oil\n* Oak bark\n* Menthyl Acetate\n* Mint\n* Marjoram\n* Lemongrass\n* Papaya\n* Orange\n* Phenol\n* Peppermint\n* Menthoxypropanediol\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate\n* Thyme\n* TEA-lauryl sulfate\n* Sodium C14-16 olefin sulfate\n* Wintergreen\n* Ylang-ylang\n* Witch hazel\n\nHey guys! I guess you people have checked the above-mentioned list of items. Well, you may be surprised by some of these ingredients. These [ingredients irritate your skin](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7960865782616622075/1316533852236492673#). So, it will be best to avoid them.  \n\n\nYou guys may be looking for an explanation right? If you are...well I’m not going to disappoint you. Below I’m going to list out some of the must avoid ingredients for sensitive skin.\n\nHere we go!!! Let’s move on to what should sensitive skin avoid?  \n\n\n### Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate And Sodium Lauryl Sulfate\n\nBoth ammonium lauryl sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate can be found in lots of skincare as well as toothpaste. The main job of these ingredients is to create lather and foam.\n\nWhat happens if you continuously use products that contain these two ingredients, well your skin ends up with skin irritation and dryness.\n\nIf you want to find results for yourself, then just stop using ammonium lauryl sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate-based products for few days you will find a positive effect for yourself.\n\n### Harsh Exfoliants\n\nYou usually exfoliate your skin to get rid of dead skin. Do you really get rid of dead skin by exfoliating with harsh chemicals? No, not. \n\nIf you are willing to benefit your sensitive skin, then you have to exfoliate your skin by using natural ingredients like lactic acid that is best for sensitive skin.\n\n**Chemicals Found In Sunscreen**\n\nThe main job of sunscreen is to protect your skin from [harmful UV rays.](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7960865782616622075/1316533852236492673#) Well, the chemicals like octinoxate, avobenzone, oxybenzone may be good for normal skin type. \n\nFor sensitive skin then it is best to say goodbye to this chemical-based sunscreen. \n\n### Apricot Kernels\n\nIf you are using the scrub on regular basis you would have aware of the tiny granules in a face scrub. You know what? These granules are very harmful to your sensitive skin. \n\nSpeaking of scrub I would like to share my own experience on it. If you have already read my previous articles, I have mentioned that I also own sensitive skin.\n\nYears back to try a face scrub for the first time. That face scrub is for skin whitening well I don’t want to mention its brand. But I’ll give you a clue. It is one of the most popular brands.\n\nAfter using it, instead of bright skin, my skin became tan, I got pimples and irritation. Well after that I said a huge good by to face scrub.\n\nIf you experience the same, you can try gommage peel that will be gentle on your skin.\n\n**Alcohol**\n\nAlcohol is not only injurious to your health but well it is also injurious to your sensitive skin. If you are looking for what should sensitive skin avoid? Then the first thing is to avoid is alcohol-based products. Instead of alcohol-based, you can move on to glycerin-based skincare products, that will be gentle on your skin.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2tvijhzj7g61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=effefb1f53cc01b7084504dff446693885653c48\n\n**Essential Oils**\n\nNot every essential oil is good for your skin. Where some of them convert to harsh chemicals when they are exposed to sunlight.\n\nIf you are looking for the best essential oil for sensitive skin, you can try tea tree oil, which is good for your skin.\n\n**Fragrance**\n\nThe fragrance is used in almost any skincare products. Some of the fragrances are natural and most of them are synthetic. These synthetic products not only smell good, but they are also really tempting and make you buy them. So be aware and step back from this artificial fragrance that is very harmful.\n\nInstead of these products, you can utilize products that are specially made for sensitive skin and are also free from harmful ingredients.\n\n## Ingredients That Are Good For Sensitive Skin\n\nInstead of checking for what should sensitive skin avoid? You can also check for what ingredients are good for sensitive skin?\n\nInstead of concluding, I would like to end this article with a positive note.\n\n1. Aloe Vera\n2. Chamomile extract\n3. Calendula extract\n4. Shea butter\n5. Squalane\n6. Marshmallow extract\n7. Beeswax\n\nNot only these, but you can also make your skincare products like [natural massage cream for sensitive skin](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7960865782616622075/1316533852236492673#) for yourself.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, I have listed out what should sensitive skin avoid? One thing you have to consider is to check for ingredients used in skincare products before buying them. Well, some of these products are very much harmful to your skin.  \n\n\nIf you want clarification, you can check for reviews before buying them. \n\nHey, in this article I have mentioned my personal experience with a specified skincare product.

Chẳng ai muốn rơi vào tình huống mặt nổi mụn, để rồi phải che chắn rườm rà, ngại tiếp xúc với người khác. Thế nhưng không phải ai cũng có thể thành công trong việc giữ gìn làn da sạch mụn.\n\n## Các nguyên nhân gây mụn không ai ngờ tới\n\n[Nguyên nhân gây mụn](https://docosan.com/blog/da-lieu/nguyen-nhan-gay-mun/) rất đa dạng, có thể chia làm hai nhóm, nguyên nhân chủ quan và nguyên nhân khách quan. Đối với các nguyên nhân chủ quan, sự thay đổi thói quen theo hướng lành mạnh sẽ giúp ngăn mụn xuất hiện. Còn đối với các nguyên nhân khách quan, nhận biết và phòng tránh sẽ có ích cho việc ngừa mụn.\n\nCác nguyên nhân gây mụn này liên quan đến các thói quen như giờ giấc sinh hoạt, chế độ ăn uống và việc dùng mỹ phẩm, … Nhiều thói quen rất đỗi bình thường lại khiến da mọc mụn và chỉ bạn chỉ cần chú ý để thay đổi, dù chỉ một chút cũng sẽ hỗ trợ rất tốt trong việc ngừa mụn.\n\n### Chế độ ăn uống không lành mạnh\n\nChế độ ăn uống tác động nhiều đến sự hình thành và phát triển mụn. Những gì chúng ta nạp vào cơ thể hàng ngày có thể giúp ích hoặc ảnh hưởng không tốt đến cơ thể. Do đó chế độ ăn uống là một trong những nguyên nhân gây mụn chủ yếu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/124z3gccr0w81.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d23d1ba6768bdcd28b4c438005d4734503026f1b\n\n#### Không đủ khoáng chất và vitamin chống oxy hóa\n\nTrong cơ thể, *lượng vitamin C, E, kẽm, selen và carotenoids* giúp chống lại các gốc tự do – phá vỡ elastin trong da, giúp tạo ra collagen và sửa chữa những tổn thương trên da. Nếu cơ thể thiếu các chất dinh dưỡng này thì cơ chế kháng mụn không được đảm bảo.\n\n#### Ăn nhiều thực phẩm chế biến sẵn/ thức ăn nhanh\n\nThực phẩm chế biến sẵn có *lượng tinh bột cao.* Lượng tinh bột cao sẽ khiến mức insulin trong cơ thể tăng để ổn định đường huyết. Việc tăng insulin trong máu có thể dẫn đến tình trạng tăng sản xuất androgen. Androgen làm nở lỗ chân lông và tăng tiết bã nhờn, tạo điều kiện cho mụn trứng cá xuất hiện.\n\n#### Sản phẩm chế biến từ sữa\n\nCác sản phẩm từ sữa tạo ra *phản ứng insulin*, khi được nạp quá nhiều sản phẩm từ sữa, lượng insulin được tạo ra nhiều hơn. Sự tăng lên của insulin dẫn đến sự tăng lên của androgen, androgen làm cho da tăng tiết bã nhờn khiến cho mụn hình thành.\n\n#### Đồ uống có cồn khiến các loại mụn phát triển\n\nNhiều nghiên cứu chỉ ra rằng, uống nhiều đồ uống có cồn có thể dễ bị nổi mụn trứng cá.\n\n### Thói quen sinh hoạt hằng ngày không tốt\n\n#### Nặn mụn thường xuyên\n\nNhiều người không để ý rằng *thói quen nặn mụn* làm cho làn da quanh mụn sưng đỏ hơn và để lại sẹo mụn, rỗ tại nơi từng có nốt mụn. Hơn nữa ngón tay nặn mụn không sạch vô tình đưa vi khuẩn vào vết mụn đang nặn, làm cho tình trạng viêm nhiễm nghiêm trọng hơn. Bạn không nên nặn mụn mà hãy sử dụng kem trị mụn để nốt mụn tự khô, cồi mụn tự tiêu đi.\n\n#### Rửa mặt quá nhiều\n\nMặc dù da mặt cần được giữ gìn sạch sẽ, tuy nhiên việc rửa mặt quá thường xuyên với sữa rửa mặt sẽ *khiến da bị khô*, da sẽ *tự tiết ra nhiều dầu hơn* lượng cần thiết để cân bằng độ ẩm. Vì vậy lượng dầu thừa sẽ gây bít lỗ chân lông, từ đó rất dễ hình thành mụn. Thay vì rửa mặt nhiều lần, bạn nên rửa mặt vào buổi sáng khi bạn thức dậy và buổi tối trước khi đi ngủ.\n\n#### Tẩy tế bào chết không đúng cách\n\nTẩy da chết nhiều lần hoặc dùng sai phương pháp đều khiến cho da bị tổn thương và kích ứng, làm cho cấu trúc da bị yếu đi, tạo cơ hội cho mụn xuất hiện.\n\nTẩy tế bào chết trên da bằng khăn lau, xơ mướp, … với lực tay mạnh hoặc quá nhiều lần một tuần sẽ khiến da bị tổn thương, ửng đỏ và đau rát. Bên cạnh đó, sự lạm dụng các chất tẩy tế bào chết hóa học như axit chuyên để peel da, hỗn hợp tẩy tế bào chết có hạt kích thước lớn, muối rửa mặt, … với mong muốn trị mụn nhanh sẽ gây ra các kích ứng da và có thể khiến cho làn da bị mụn trứng cá càng trở nên trầm trọng.\n\nBạn cần chú ý việc tẩy da chết tốt nhất chỉ nên thực hiện 1 lần/ tuần cho các loại da. Khi tẩy da chết, bàn tay phải sạch, vật dụng hay mỹ phẩm tẩy da chết còn hạn sử dụng, động tác xoa mặt cần phải nhẹ nhàng, xoa đều khắp mặt. Bên cạnh đó, bạn cần rửa mặt bằng nước ấm và nên chọn sữa rửa mặt loại có thành phần từ thiên nhiên, ít chất tạo bọt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gertnzcr0w81.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfaa3479f04a0bfb58b8fdbcbed28f5722fe356e\n\n#### Stress\n\nTình trạng stress “nhẹ” giúp chúng ta có thể làm việc tốt hơn, có động lực hơn. Tuy nhiên, khi cơ thể bị stress sẽ giải phóng ra chất neuropeptide và thay đổi nội tiết tố. Bị stress trong một thời gian dài với mức độ nặng thì sẽ bị những ảnh hưởng không mong muốn như mọc mụn, lão hóa da, …\n\n#### Màn hình điện thoại di động bẩn\n\nKhông ai có thể phủ nhận được những tiện lợi mà chiếc điện thoại thông minh mang lại, chính vì vậy, điện thoại dần trở thành vật bất li thân của nhiều người.\n\nTuy nhiên, smartphone cũng có thể trở thành tác nhân gây mụn. Bởi mỗi khi nghe điện thoại, da mặt chúng ta vô tình tiếp xúc với bụi bẩn, vi khuẩn,… ngay trên màn hình điện thoại. Vì vậy, thường xuyên làm sạch màn hình là một điều cần thiết.\n\n#### Không làm sạch mồ hôi\n\nNếu bạn đã tiếp xúc với ánh nắng mặt trời trong một thời gian dài, da của bạn sẽ đổ mồ hôi. Tuy nhiên, bạn không nên để mồ hôi tự khô trên da của mình, mồ hôi cùng với bã nhờn, bụi bẩn, … cũng bịt kín lỗ chân lông, từ đó gây mụn. Bạn nên tắm hoặc rửa mặt ngay sau khi đổ mồ hôi để không cho mụn cơ hội xuất hiện nhé!\n\n#### Ít khi gội đầu\n\n*Đầu thừa trên da đầu* có thể chảy xuống trán, gáy, lưng, khiến cho lỗ chân lông ở những vùng da này bị bít tắc, gây nên mụn. Vì thế, những người có làn da dầu nên gội đầu thường xuyên để dầu thừa không chảy xuống trán và gáy, loại bỏ một trong những nguyên nhân gây mụn.\n\n#### Sản phẩm chăm sóc tóc dính trên da\n\nMột trong những nguyên nhân không ngờ tới khiến chúng ta bị mụn chính là việc các sản phẩm chăm sóc tóc tiếp xúc da mặt. Một số sản phẩm như: gel, sáp tạo kiểu, thuốc nhuộm, gôm bọt xịt tóc… *có chứa những thành phần dễ gây mụn cho da*: Silicon, Propylene glycol, Sodium lauryl sulfate, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, …\n\nKhi cơ thể đổ mồ hôi, mồ hôi sẽ đưa các thành phần từ sản phẩm chăm sóc tóc chảy xuống trán, má. Nếu bạn không làm sạch da mặt ngay, những thành phần đó dễ tích tụ trên da, gây tắc lỗ chân lông và gây mụn. Bạn cũng lưu ý, khi sử dụng các sản phẩm cho tóc, hãy chắc chắn rằng chúng không dây ra mặt bằng cách che chắn hợp lí.\n\n### Sử dụng mỹ phẩm không đúng cách\n\nSử dụng mỹ phẩm không đúng cách cũng khiến cho da nổi mụn.\n\n#### Sử dụng mỹ phẩm giả \n\nHiện nay trên thị trường, mỹ phẩm bị làm giả hay nhái được bày bán tràn lan. Chỉ cần sơ xuất hoặc không tìm hiểu kỹ, chúng ta rất dễ mua phải sản phẩm kém chất lượng.\n\nVà khi sử dụng những sản phẩm đó, nguy cơ da bị dị ứng, mọc mụn là điều không thể tránh. Vì vậy, trước khi mua bất kỳ sản phẩm làm đẹp hay chăm sóc cơ thể nào, chúng ta hãy tìm mua ở những địa chỉ uy tín.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8nym9pdr0w81.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad58cafc1cfa8579163b8cd4e48396dfce408a0c\n\n#### Sử dụng mỹ phẩm quá hạn sử dụng\n\nRất nhiều người không có thói quen trang điểm thường xuyên. Một năm họ có thể chỉ dùng mỹ phẩm một vài lần. Tuy nhiên, hạn sử dụng mỹ phẩm kể từ ngày mở nắp lại có thời hạn nhất định. Chẳng hạn như 3 tháng, 6 tháng, 12 tháng,… Do đó, nếu dùng những loại mỹ phẩm đã *quá hạn mở nắp*, một số *thành phần có thể biến đổi thành những chất gây hại cho da*, khiến làn da bị kích ứng, gây mụn.\n\n#### Tẩy trang sai cách \n\nKhông tẩy trang hoặc tẩy trang sai cách sẽ khiến cho bã nhờn, bụi bẩn, da chết,… tích tụ, gây tắc lỗ chân lông từ đó mụn sẽ hình thành.\n\nNhiều người cho rằng sữa rửa mặt có thể rửa trôi lớp trang điểm, quan niệm này là sai. Mặc dù hiện nay có nhiều dòng sữa rửa mặt kiêm tẩy trang nhưng sử dụng những sản phẩm này không rửa trôi hết những hạt phấn rơi xuống lỗ chân lông, lâu dần sẽ hình thành mụn. Vì vậy bạn đừng bỏ qua bước tẩy trang trước khi rửa mặt nhé!\n\n#### Dùng mỹ phẩm có chứa dầu\n\nNếu da của bạn thuộc loại da nhờn dễ bị mụn thì bạn không nên dùng mỹ phẩm có chứa dầu. Khi chọn mua mỹ phẩm, hãy mua những loại dán nhãn không chứa dầu (nhãn có thể ghi là no sebum, oil cut powder, …) không gây mụn (non-comedogenic) và không gây dị ứng (no paraben, no alcohol, no silicone,…)  để bảo vệ da.\n\n### Tác động từ bên ngoài\n\nNgoài những nguyên nhân chủ quan kể trên thì vẫn còn nhiều nguyên nhân khách quan gây mụn trên da. Những nguyên nhân này chúng ta không hoặc ít thay đổi được, vì vậy chúng ta chỉ có thể tránh một số yếu tố, từ đó giúp da khỏe hơn, hạn chế tác nhân gây mụn.\n\n#### Sự thiếu cân bằng Hormones tuổi dậy thì \n\nMụn trứng cá thông thường thường xuất hiện khi *nội tiết tố thay đổi*, nhất là ở độ tuổi dậy thì. Mụn trứng cá được gây ra bởi sự gia tăng mức độ hormone androgen.\n\nKhi nồng độ androgen tăng lên, các tuyến dầu (hay còn gọi là bã nhờn) dưới da sẽ lớn hơn. Lỗ chân lông phải chứa lượng bã nhờn quá nhờn, kết hợp với tế bào chết, vi khuẩn dễ bị tắc nghẽn. Từ đó mụn bắt đầu hình thành.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mbjvhiher0w81.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47c1264bfbdd52952b60b88b2041526bf980c7ef\n\n#### Di truyền \n\nDi truyền cũng có thể ảnh hưởng đến việc mọc mụn trứng cá. Điều này cũng giải thích vì sao có một số người dễ bị mụn trứng cá, trong khi người khác thì không.\n\nMột nghiên cứu lớn ở Anh sau khi quan sát trên 400 cặp sinh đôi chỉ ra rằng 81% mụn trứng cá là do yếu tố di truyền.\n\n#### Thay đổi môi trường sống\n\nMụn có thể bùng phát trong những chuyến công tác, du lịch dài ngày. Ở điều kiện môi trường mới, nguồn nước, khí hậu thời tiết, độ ẩm,… đều có thể khiến tuyến bã nhờn hoạt động bất thường và gây mụn.\n\nBài viết đã đề cập một số nguyên nhân gây mụn, cả chủ quan và khách quan với mong muốn hỗ trợ bạn đọc trong việc điều trị mụn. Để rút ngắn thời gian trị mụn, bạn nên thay đổi thói quen sinh hoạt theo hướng tích cực, chăm sóc da cẩn thận và gặp bác sĩ da liễu khi phát hiện tình trạng mụn nặng như mụn bọc, mụn nang trên da.\n\n## Địa chỉ phòng khám da liễu trị mụn trứng cá\n\n* Phòng khám Da liễu Trần Thịnh được rất nhiều người dân ở khu vực Quận 5 biết đến bởi chuyên môn điều trị và sự tân tâm của bác sĩ.\n* Quy tụ đội ngũ Tiến sĩ, Thạc sĩ, Bác sĩ v.v dày dặn kinh nghiệm, Khoa da liễu Bệnh viện Y học cổ truyền Trung Ương là nơi khám chữa bệnh đáng tin cậy.\n* Viện thẩm mỹ da liễu Oracle beauty clinic quy tụ nhiều chuyên gia da liễu Hàn Quốc và Việt Nam chuyên trị các vấn đề da liễu như mụn, sẹo, …",

The thing is, I've gone months at a time where the clogs disappear and stay away, even while the SD remains consistent.  \n\nFrom about Febuary to late March, I was completely clear, but recently they started to return despite no change in skincare routine.  I realized yesterday that they started appearing again around when I switched to a different shampoo after running out of the Selsun Blue that I was using during the time that I wasn't having issues.  I don't have an exact timeline of the events so I'm not completely sure that it's the cause, but I feel that it's worth investigating, especially since the clogs appear on my forehead which is the only place that would come into consistent contact with the shampoo.  \n\nI read the ingredients of both and saw that the new shampoo contains SLS, while Selsun Blue contains ALS.  \n\nMy question is:  could it be possible that SLS would cause issues while ALS doesn't?  Are they different enough to trigger different symptoms?  \n\nThanks so much to anyone who has any knowledge or input on the situation.",

However, even if you identify with those people, this article is going to assist you in understanding the right hair care techniques.\n\nOur hair can make us look neat and tidy or tired and careless. It does not matter if our hair is dry or oily; Be oven or flat. In any case, it is better to know the basic principles of caring for your hair.\n\nIf we do not pay attention to daily hair care, they will be damaged and repairing damaged hair is much more difficult than preventing damage.\n\nEnsure that you get enough sleep and rest every night. A healthy amount of sleep a night is around 6-8 hours a night, depending on your body's physiology. If you get enough rest you will have a healthier body that in turn will make your hair shinier and more healthy than ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHair is very fragile when it is wet. Avoid combing or brushing your hair when it is wet. It will more easily break and stretch out when wet and you try to brush it. At the very least wait until it is damp to brush your hair out, this minimizes damage.\n\nwe suggest you to buy some safe hair care from big brands like vitaminshop, amvitamins and vitaminworld.\n\n**Choose the right shampoo.**\n\nIf your shampoo or conditioner is not suitable, the health of your hair will be endangered. So, choose a shampoo that suits your hair. Shampoos are divided into three categories based on the type of hair: \"Suitable for dry, normal and oily hair.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have dandruff or hair loss, use anti-hair loss shampoos and anti-dandruff shampoos.\n\nAvoid shampoos that contain unsuitable compounds such as ammonium lauryl sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate.\n\nbest **Vitamins for haircare**\n\nTake a daily multi-vitamin. One of the best ways to ensure healthy hair growth is to take in a balanced diet with plenty of vitamins. Taking a daily multi-vitamin will supplement your dietary intake to ensure that your body's needs are met or exceeded. Select a high-quality vitamin designed for people of your age and gender.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour lifestyle influences the way your hair looks. **Being stressed, not getting enough sleep or smoking tobacco means your hair will not look good**. You also need to maintain a balanced diet so that your hair gets all the vitamins and nutrients it needs. Get rid of your bad habits and you should see a difference!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsource of this article: [amvitamins.com](https://amvitamins.com)",

With the market flooded with options, finding the truly best body wash for sensitive skin can be overwhelming. This guide provides thorough reviews of the top body washes expected to dominate the market in 2025,focusing on their ingredients,effectiveness,and suitability for different types of sensitive skin. We aim to help you make an informed decision, ensuring a comfortable and healthy cleansing experience.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated best body wash for sensitive skin on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-section/?kw=best body wash for sensitive skin)\n\n## Key Features Analysis\n\nThe effectiveness of a body wash for sensitive skin hinges on several key attributes. These include the formulation, the absence of harsh chemicals, the presence of soothing ingredients, and the overall hypoallergenic nature of the product. This review delves into these critical features, providing a detailed analysis of each product included.\n\n**Hypoallergenic Formulation:** This is perhaps the most critically important feature for sensitive skin. Hypoallergenic formulations are designed to minimize the risk of allergic reactions by excluding common irritants such as fragrances, dyes, and parabens.The ingredients are carefully selected and tested to ensure they are gentle and non-sensitizing, making these body washes suitable for even the most reactive skin types.\n\n**Fragrance-Free or Naturally Scented:** Fragrances, even those considered \"natural,\" can be a major trigger for sensitive skin. Many of the top body washes for sensitive skin are completely fragrance-free, eliminating this potential irritant. Others utilize natural essential oils in vrey low concentrations, such as chamomile or lavender, known for their calming properties. However, even with natural scents, patch testing is recommended.\n\n**Soap-Free and pH-Balanced:** Traditional soaps tend to be alkaline, disrupting the skin's natural pH balance and stripping away essential oils, resulting in dryness and irritation. The best body washes for sensitive skin are soap-free and pH-balanced, typically around 5.5, which matches the skin's natural acidity. This helps maintain the skin's barrier function and prevents moisture loss.\n\n**Enriched with Soothing and Moisturizing Ingredients:** Beyond simply cleansing, the top body washes for sensitive skin incorporate soothing and moisturizing ingredients.Common examples include aloe vera,oatmeal,glycerin,shea butter,and ceramides. These ingredients help to calm inflammation, hydrate the skin, and restore the skin's protective barrier, leaving the skin feeling soft and supple.\n\n**dermatologist-Tested and Recommended:** A dermatologist's stamp of approval provides added reassurance. Body washes that have undergone rigorous dermatological testing and are recommended by dermatologists are generally considered to be safe and effective for sensitive skin.

    "body": "Did you know? If you check the back of the bottle of any popular commercial hair oil in the market, you will find the quantity of synthetic ingredients more than the quantity of pure quality, clean ingredients. Why is that so? Why can’t the most valuable hair oil brands in the world afford to put only clean pure quality ingredients into their formulations? Like any other topical product that you apply to your skin & hair, oils get absorbed into your skin. \n\nHence, you must beware of the shady gimmicks that hair oil brands use in order to fool customers. \n\n# Let’s decode everything about harmful ingredients used in hair oils and how they affect your system:\n\n\n\n**1. Mineral Oil:**  \nThis is a petroleum by product and one of the cheapest fillers in hair oils. It forms a barrier onto the hair and skin and this cause clogging of pores. Mineral oil form a thick, occlusive layer onto the hair, giving the illusion of smoothness and shine. Although, it doesn’t actually penetrate into the hair and scalp, leading to buildup . The layer it coats around the scalp, prevents essential nutrients like natural oils and serums from penetrating. There are several studies on [mineral oil being a proven carcinogen](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/mineral-oils). Since it is non biodegradable, it contributes to environmental pollution. \n\n**2. Silicones:** If you see an ingredient in your oil which ends with cone or siloxane .i.e Dimethicone or cyclopentasiloxane, please keep it 10 feet away from your skin & hair! Yes, silicones are that ingredient in most conditioners, oils and smoothening serums which give your hair that gloss and shine. But, they can create buildup with excessive use and can clog hair follicles, weakening the hair follicles. This can gradually make the hair fall out of the root. \n\n**3. Parabens:** Parabens are preservatives which are commonly used in beauty and skincare products to increase their shelf life. However it can cause microbial growth and lead to hair thinning. It is a major endocrine disruptor, which can interfere with the body’s hormone production. It can also increase the risk of breast cancer. \n\n**4. Synthetic Fragrances(phthalates):**   \nSynthetic/Artificial Fragrances get absorbed deep in the skin and into the bloodstream. They increase the risk of breast cancer and other hormone related cancers. \n\n**5. Sulfates:**   \nThese are detergents that are commonly used in shampoos, soaps and other washing detergents. While they might be excellent at cleansing your scalp and hair, these can be harsh and can strip your scalp off moisture and natural oils. These include SLS, SLES and Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate. \n\n**6. Formaldehyde:**   \nThese are a preservative used to increase the shelf life of a product. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies formaldehyde as a Group 1 carcinogen, meaning it has strong links to nasal and throat cancers with long-term exposure. Formaldehyde is a disinfectant used as a strong antimicrobial agent to kill bacteria and viruses. But with continued use, it can cause issues like respiratory disorders, skin irritation and other hazardous conditions. \n\n**7. Artificial colors:**   \nArtificial colors contain heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and mercury which if interfere with bodily functions can cause bladder cancer and other allergies. \n\n**8. Alcohol(Isopropyl Ethanol):**  \n Alcohol is a common irritant which can cause excessive dryness within the scalp and make the hair brittle and weak. It can cause inflammatory conditions like scalp psoriasis, flaking and dandruff, especially if you have a sensitive scalp. It can make hair look dull, lacklustre and frizzy. \n\n**9. Triethanolamine (TEA):**   \nThis is a pH balancing and emulsifying agent commonly found in hair care products. While it helps with blending of oils, it can strip away your natural oils. It can alter the pH balance of your scalp, weakening your hair structure. This is especially harmful for people with low porosity or curly hair types. TEA is often contaminated with nitrosamines, which are potentially carcinogenic (cancer-causing) chemicals. Long term use of oils which contain this ingredient can weaken the overall scalp barrier, leading to thinning and hair loss.   \n\n\nIf you’re looking for a \"[hair growth oil](https://www.soulflower.in/products/rosemary-essential-oil-hair-growth?variant=41487239807229)\", you have to look for ingredients that will do more than just moisturising and smoothening your hair. You have to select ingredients like rosemary, castor, amla, peppermint that actually have clinical backing for hair growth efficacy and hair health in general. Using hair oil with any of these extra unwanted additives is like calling for hair loss yourself. When in search for a good quality, effective hair growth oil, make sure the ingredient list only contains 100% pure and natural ingredients, formulated with clinical evidence. ",

You may utilize a facial cleaning agent that can effectively clear up soil, pollutants, overabundance oil and cosmetics yet it can bring about losing the skin's normal dampness which makes your skin drier. Dry skin needs fairly shedding to eliminate the flaky skin alongside debasements and fills in the common cream that seals in the skin and doesn't hurt pH balance and hindrance. \n\nThe best facewash for dry skin is the one that has sets its need to make your skin hydrated with its initially scrub. These sorts of face washes deal with the epidermis-the furthest layer of the skin. It is otherwise called a skin obstruction. The facewash extraordinarily defined for dry skin get the aggravations far from the skin hindrance and secures in the common oils and the dampness. \n\nOn the off chance that the skin hindrance is better, every one of the issues identified with skin dryness (layered patches, unpleasant, tingling sensation, redness dull, flaky and tight skin) will be under control. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow to pick that one and only facewash for dry skin? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n· Confirm by and by that the skin type is dry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n· Avoid sodium chloride, isopropyl liquor, sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate and salicylic acids as fixings in facewash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n· Look for fundamental oil, spread and glycerin\n\n\\#foynaturals #skincare #skin #healthyskin #happyskin",

Looking at the ingredients I was surprised the second ingredient was ammonium lauryl sulfate because I thought Suave Naturals didn't use sulfates, but I haven't looked at the shampoos too much. So a few questions here: 1. Is this shampoo too old/has it gone bad? 2. Would this be useful in removing the cones from my conditioner? and 3. Would this be a good shampoo to hold onto or should I just toss it?\n\n\n\nIngredients: Water, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Chloride, Tocopheryl Acetate, Passion Flower Extract, Peppermint Extract, Rose Extract, Lavender Extract, Cocamide MEA, Fragrance, PEG-5 Cocamide, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, D&C Red No 33, D&C Orange No 4.",
