    "body": "Deep conditioning is a best practice to incorporate into your hair routine. Even if you feel your hair is not damaged, deep conditioners still help maintain healthy looking hair over time. Choosing how often to deep condition and which products to use can be a challenge. Deep conditioners go by many names, but are often thicker and heavier in their ingredient concentration.\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-deep-conditioning-your-hair.html))\n\n**What hair types and styles need deep conditioning?**\n\n* Long hair that feels dry\n* Chemically altered hair (examples: hair that has been lightened, permed, relaxed)\n* Naturally dry hair\n* [Damaged hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html)\n* [Hair with frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n* Swimmers that expose their hair to chlorine often\n* Beach lovers with sun-bleached hair\n* People with hard water, or who use well water\n* Anyone who frequently uses high heat to style their hair (ex: flat iron)‚Äã\n\n**What is the goal of a deep conditioning treatment for hair?**  \n‚ÄãThe two goals here are (1) hydration and (2) slip. Both help with the appearance and overall longevity of your hair's strands.¬†  \n\n\nHydration\n\n* Silky, flexible strands (versus dry, brittle ones) with more shine\n* Smooth¬†ends (versus puffy and frayed)\n* On curly hair - curls that form evenly (versus inconsistently)\n\nSlip\n\n* Reduces¬†[tangling](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---tangles.html)\n* Reduces friction from¬†[traction damage](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html) (to help hair grow)\n* Reduces[ frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n\n**How often should I deep condition?**  \nThis is unique to each person's hair type. Deep conditioning bi-monthly or monthly is common. If your hair is damaged, you can deep condition up to once a week. For more insights on how to fit deep conditioning into your routine, check out my post on [Hair Schedules](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-schedules.html).\n\n**What are the best ingredients for deep conditioners?**  \nBelow I've shared common ingredients you'll find in conditioner and/or deep conditioners. It's helpful to know what these ingredients are in case a company doesn't use the term \"deep conditioner\" on the product label. Other terms used for deep conditioning-related products are:¬† hair treatment, hair tonic, hair lotion and hair masque. You can also check out my post on [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html)¬†for more insights on ingredient lists.\n\n* Panthenol\n* Glycerin\n* Amino Acids\n* Peptides\n* Cetyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol\n* Hydrolyzed proteins (ex: wheat, soy, keratin protein)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Quaternium-87\n* Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Dicetyldimonium Chloride\n* Distearyldimonium Chloride\n* Polyquaternium 55\n* Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride¬†\n* Polyquaternium-44¬†\n* Cetrimonium Bromide\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride\n* Laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed¬†\n* Polyquaternium-4\n* Polyquaternium-10\n\n**How should you deep condition your hair?**  \nI've listed the process I recommend to my clients to help them get the best hydration and slip below.\n\n* Shampoo twice with clarifying shampoo, or use a regular shampoo plus a detox treatment, and¬†rinse well.\n* Ring out most of the water from your hair, and/or soak it up with a towel.\n* Apply conditioner or deep conditioner from roots-to-ends.\n* Massage conditioner and water into your¬†hair. Good coverage equals a better result. This can look like a combination of the¬†techniques below. You can read more about the squeezing and scrunching¬†technique [here](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/) in Cosmopolitan.\n   * untangling\n   * working in sections\n   * pressing root to tip\n   * gentle squeezing\n   * scrunching\n   * combing\n   * gathering all the hair together‚Äã\n* Let the deep conditioner sit for between 10-20 minutes on¬†thicker hair or¬†5 - 10 minutes on¬†finer hair.\n* Dunk hair in¬†water using a sink or cup, or just quickly rewet in the shower.\n* Use the techniques listed¬†above to press more water into the hair.\n* Do a final rise. On drier hair, this can be a quick rinse that leaves more conditioner residue.¬†On finer hair, you'll want to do a more thorough rinse to prevent the deep conditioner from weighing your hair down.¬†\n* Add leave-in products.\n* End with drying and/or styling¬† method of your choice:\n   * ‚ÄãAir dry (avoid this method if it will take more than one hour to dry)\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with¬†cold air\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with hot air and¬†[heat protection](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html)\n\n**Can you over-condition hair?**  \nIf you are experiencing hair that appears:\n\n* limp, flat or heavy\n* to have build up or residue\n* straighter than you'd like\n* greasy or too shiny\n\nthen you could be over-conditioning. Try cutting back on the amount of deep conditioning treatments in your routine, switching conditioners to one that is for volume, or lightly shampooing after you condition. You can also check out my post on [Hygral Fatigue](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hygral-fatigue.html) to learn more about maintaining balance between moisture and protein in your hair.¬†",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it‚Äôs definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 ‚Äì 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don‚Äôt use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I‚Äôve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life‚Äôs problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I‚Äôve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn‚Äôt been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn‚Äôt feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I‚Äôm kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don‚Äôt have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn‚Äôt help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúprotective‚Äù according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn‚Äôt ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can‚Äôt verify (it cited the manufacturer‚Äôs website but I can‚Äôt find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can‚Äôt tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I‚Äôm trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement. Thank you üôèüèªüñ§\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Shampoo:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamide DIPA, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, Polyquaternium 10, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Sodium Gluconate, Glucose, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Conditioner:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Chloride, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Tocotrienols, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyquaternium-4, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance/Parfum, Citric Acid, Cyclohexasiloxane, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**HealthySexyHair Conditioner:** Water (Aqua, Eau), Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Isopropyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-37, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/ Dicaprate, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Silicone Quaternium-22, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Hydroxy-ethylcellulose, Sodium PCA, Propylene Glycol, Quaternium-80, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone,Panthenol, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, C11-15 Pareth-7, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Magnesium Nitrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Palmitamidopro- pyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Magnesium Chloride, Trisodium HEDTA, Acacia Dealbata Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Moonstone Extract (lol), Fragrance (Parfum), Methylchloroisothiazolinone,Methylisothiazolinone, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Glyoxal, Sodium Nitrate, Limonene.",

    "body": "I picked up a new bottle of Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Gel, my HG gel that I've been using for years now, and noticed that the packaging had changed. I still had a bottle with the old packaging, so I compared the ingredients list to see if formula had been changed as well, and yes, it has.\n\nHere is the ingredients list for the *old* formula:\n\nWater/Eau, Laureth-23, Polyquaternium-4, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Benzyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Aminomethyl Propanol, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance/Parfum, Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ecklonia Radiata Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n\nHere is the ingredients list for the *new* formula:\n\nWater, Laureth-23, Polyquaternium-4, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Ecklonia, Radiata Extract, Fragrance, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Benzyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate, Copolymer, Aminomethyl Propanol, DMDM Hydantoin, Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n\nBoth formulas have identical ingredients, so the new formula is still CG friendly, but the order of the ingredients has changed. In the old formula, the aloe leaf and Australian sea kelp extracts and jojoba oil were the last three ingredients. In the new formula, the extracts and jojoba oil have moved to the top of the ingredients list after the first three ingredients, which are the same in both formulas (water, laureth-23, and polyquaternium-4).\n\nFor reference, I took a photo of both bottles side-by-side, [front](https://imgur.com/72OIjeF) and [back](https://imgur.com/NFD47G7). Old packaging is on the left, new packing on the right. If you can't view the images, the old packing was in a mostly transparent tube, and the new packaging is solid purple. Both bottles claim 20 hour \"maximum\" hold. The size of the bottle has remained the same (7 oz).\n\nI haven't had the chance to test out new formula yet, so I can't attest to how the performance has changed. I did squirt out about a dime-sized amount for a quick comparison, though. The texture, consistency, and fragrance seems to be the same. This has been my HG gel for years now, I've even recommended it several times on this sub, and I'm really hoping that the reformulation doesn't drastically affect how it performs on my hair. If is drastically different and doesn't give me as much hold as the old formula, I'm going to be very disappointed and will probably have to start looking for a new gel. I'll try to post a full review of the new formula once I have an opportunity to really test it out.\n\nHas anyone used the new formula yet? What do you think about it?",

We have some information we want to share with you.\n\nDMDM hydantoin is a formaldehyde-releasing preservative that's in some hair and skin products. Most people don't have issues with this, but it is possible to be allergic to formaldehyde, which means you'll [likely](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1988.tb02802.x) also react to DMDM hydantoin. Your doctor or an allergist would be able to confirm this. We obviously don't know if that's what's happening here, but hair loss is a known side effect of allergic reactions that cause contact dermatitis.\n\nFormaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but in tiny amounts in a rinse off product, it's not likely to have a health impact in the grand scheme of things unless you are allergic.\n\nUnlike the DevaCurl allegations, the DMDM hydantoin controversy (and any related lawsuits) is tied to this specific ingredient. If you do happen to have issues with hair loss and DMDM hydantoin, you should consider checking for a formaldehyde allergy just in case, as there are [several other ingredient](https://www.contactdermatitisinstitute.com/formaldehyde.php) you might be sensitive to as well.\n\nIf I'm wrong, I probably just picked up on a keyword in your title (Please ignore me!).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(Takes a while to dry) \n\nThe styling products I've tried in my routine in the past: \n\n1. Aunt Jackie's curl la la custard and flaxseed gel (didn't do much)  \n\n2. NYM's curl talk gel and cream \n\n3. Wella hair gel (red) (too drying) \n\n4. Paul Mitchell the conditioner\n\n5. Shea moisture hibiscus smoothie \n\n6. Cantu curl activator (hated this) \n\nI use a diffuser to dry my hair but I don't think it does much except create frizz. ",

Styling cream\" from \"Capello point\". they call it styling cream but it's actually a gel, and its main ingredients are PvP/va and polyquaternium-4, no glycerin though), and I had way better results with it... major difference: the cast was much stronger, but it was scrunchable!\nNow before you think: \"why don't you use the previous one... like why are you even asking\" I have to tell you this. My parents HATE the smell of that gel (the one I used before curlsmith), and honestly, I kind of hate it too, so I'm looking for an alternative...\nSo am I doing something wrong? The method I use to apply the product is the same for both of the gels: after rinsing out conditioner, I grab a spoon of product, melt it in my hands, and lightly use the praying hands method, some scrunching in, and some finger coiling. Diffuse/air dry 50% and 50%. Then when completely dry scrunch the cast.\nOr is it that something in the gel is not working right for me?\nShould I try the in shower style fixer, maybe that will give me a cast that I'm able to scrunch?\nBtw, I have kind of a pixie cut.\nThank you all for your patience!",
