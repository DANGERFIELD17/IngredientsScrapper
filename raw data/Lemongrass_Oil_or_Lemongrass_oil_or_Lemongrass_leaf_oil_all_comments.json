    "body": "This happened about 3 months ago. I saved up money for months to take my mom to a local spa that had recently opened for Mother's Day. It was our first time being able to do something nice like that. We had manicures, pedicures, mini massages, mini facials, the works. The staff were very friendly and attentive. As soon as we set down they were explaining our day and making us comfortable. One of the first things they did was bring us chilled water to drink. My mom noted that it had a light lemon taste, which she liked. You know where this is going.\n\nWe spent 6 hours in the spa having a great time. Our session ended with time hanging out in their Himalayan salt room. It was free with our package so why not. They gave us fresh glasses of lemon water when we left the salt room and said we had to drink them because the salt would make us dehydrated. Weird, but whatever it's just water. \n\nSo I go to pay and the spa owner is with us at this point asking how we enjoyed our day. We were saying what a great time we had when mom mentioned that she liked the slight hint of lemon in the water. \n\n\"Isn't in great? We only use DoTerra essential oils here. They're the best. A few drops of lemongrass oil in a glass of water...\" I tuned her out at this point trying to not throw up because we had both drank several glasses over 6 hours. Then I remembered the faint lemon scent of the facial steamer. And the mud mask....I had the worst breakout of my life over the next several days. \n\nYeah...never going back there. Which is sad because they aren't very expensive and did a wonderful pedicure. \n\nTLDR: Took my mom for her first nice, legitimate spa day. Owner has us drinking essential oils all day without our knowledge. ",

        "body": "Uhh. I own a small massage clinic/spa AND I actually do use DoTera products quite often. This is A HARD \"no\" from me brah. You never ever ever EVERRRRR put something in someone's water without telling them. And lemongrass is a pretty hard core oil. It is very common to have infused water for clients, but not with oils. I realized they are trying to be nice and offer up schmancy water but this is not how it's done. In fact you don't ever use oils on clients without telling them. Lemongrass water is pretty popular among the MLM EO tribes, so I'm sure she's just following along with what she's seen done with no actual education on safety protocols for oils. (That education exists, you jist need to get get outside of the MLM company)\n\nYou probably didn't get hurt. If it was dangerous levels of lemongrass your lips would have been burning pretty quickly. You might get the shits today though. It's not poisonous, just very strong, and I've used it personally to help with constipation.  Because your oil was in water the individual oil particles were broken up and dispersed, it's different than putting drops of oil in your mouth. 5-10 drops of lemongrass diluted in water is a lot, your sweat or pee might smell a bit lemony but it's not so much that your mucus membranes get deeply damaged.\n\nHere is DT's lemongrass product info page   \nhttps://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/lemongrass-oil. \n  \nHere is lemongrass use page from the website I actually use and trust because they aren't trying to sell anything.   \nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/lemongrass-essential-oil#takeaway AND.  https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/lemongrass      \n     \n         \nBottom line, unless you are allergic, drinking the quantity you did probably didn't hurt you, but, it still wasn't cool.  While yes, you could call an attorney/the board/the media, you could also just call the spa and say you feel sick after drinking so much lemongrass water. Tell them to just use lemons or straight lemongrass. They were trying to do something lux but ended up being painfully cavalier. Tell them you are disappointed and won't be back because you don't feel safe. The'll probably give you a refund or a gift certificate. PLEASE TELL THEM! You don't have to distroy a small business, but they should be informed that they fucked up. Hell, if you want to PM me I'll call them for you. They need to know. \n\nSad you had your relaxing day ruined. I hope you enjoyed the time you had with family. \n\nEdit: just re-read that this was months ago. Glad you ended up okay (annoyed but okay).",

Which I agree should be disclosed, but as someone with a bizarre allergy to cucumbers I've had this issue with cucumber water myself and know it's not uncommon to simply hand out infused water. I also see why real citrus water is better and makes more sense to just make, but can also trigger people with a citrus allergy itself. \n\nCan anyone explain to me (for reals not for rudeness) why the oil drops in water are dangerous to the general (not allergic) population?

After you try them, you will discover a new world\". It was a big bottle of lube and 2 \"toys\". I considered telling her that asexual people can use them too, but that was boring. Then I remembered a certain fact that I accidentally read about lube...\n\nA week passed and today she asked me if I liked her gift. I said that I loved it and added that it smelled too weak, so I added a bit of lemongrass oil and now it's my favorite product. After she started beaming with self-satisfaction, I continued: \"See how well it moisturizes my hands! They were so dry from the constant hand-sanitizing, and it was really hard to find a product that doesn't irritate my skin!\" The look on her face was, honestly, priceless.\n\nTL;DR: Acephobe gave me lube, I used it as a hand moisturizer to spite her.

    "body": "So this week, we wanted to show you how to make Liangmian, a Sichuan cold noodle dish. It‚Äôs a classic Sichuan street snack, and a great dish to much on in summer.\n\nNow, the whole essence of this dish is its myriad of variations. When you go to a Liangmian stall, you get a whole smorgasbord of toppings and flavors to choose from.  Want it spicy? They‚Äôll add some chili oil. What more of a sour kick? They‚Äôll toss in some extra vinegar. You‚Äôll also have an assortment of stuff you can mix in, ranging from julienned cucumbers to shredded chicken.\n\nThe primary constant here‚Äôs how they‚Äôll make the noodles, which aren‚Äôt shocked in cool water like usual ‚Äì they‚Äôll prep it in a way where the sauce cling to the noodles and incorporate in a really tasty way. A secondary ‚Äòconstant‚Äô is the general seasoning mix ‚Äì while every vendor‚Äôll approach things a touch differently, there *is* generally quite a bit of overlap.  \n\nThe way we‚Äôll organize this is that I‚Äôll separate this into three sections: the noodles, the seasoning, and the toppings. Amounts are assuming five servings.\n\n[Video is here if you‚Äôd like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/95ENQDE7nvg).\n\n**Ingredients, Noodles for Sichuan Cold Noodles:**\n\n1.\t*Fresh alkaline noodles (Á¢±Ê∞¥Èù¢), 500g.* So fresh alkaline noodles are best, but you‚Äôve got a bit of flexibility with your noodles here. I‚Äôm pretty sure that Japanese ramen‚Äôs made in pretty much the same fashion (can anyone confirm or deny?)‚Ä¶ but you could really use whatever you like (Italian pasta? Sure, go for it) so long as the noodles are (1) fresh and (2) round.\n\n2.\t*Caiziyou (ËèúÁ±ΩÊ≤π) -or- Indian Mustard Seed Oil -or- Peanut Oil (Ëä±ÁîüÊ≤π), 50g.* Ok, so if you‚Äôve followed these posts before you might know our long standing love-hate relationship with ‚ÄòCaiziyou‚Äô, a cold-pressed rapeseed oil that‚Äôs the primary cooking oil in Sichuan and much of Southwest China. Caiziyou is to Sichuan food what Olive Oil is to Italian ‚Äì it‚Äôs difficult to replicate the proper flavors without it. The catch? Super unavailable in the USA and‚Ä¶ most places outside China. So a month or so back we taste tested Indian Mustard Seed oil as a possible sub, and‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs close, sort of.  Hits a lot of the same notes, but has that whole distinctive mustard-y nose-kick.  So while it‚Äôs not a general purpose one-to-one sub, it *does* work in this dish. There‚Äôs a certain Chongqing variety of Liangmian that actually includes yellow mustard in their seasoning mix, and using the mustard oil kinda replicates that taste.  And of course, if you can‚Äôt find either (you‚Äôd likely have to go to an Indian grocer to find mustard seed oil), feel free to use a quality peanut oil.\n\n**Process, Noodles for Sichuan Cold Noodles:**\n\nSo right. One critical bit of equipment here is‚Ä¶ a fan. \n\nAfter boiling the noodles, what we‚Äôre going to do is shake and pull the noodles while fanning them continuously ‚Äì this‚Äôll cool them down without having to shock them in cool water.  We used a handheld Chinese style fan for some extra super authentic bonus points, but an electric fan works just as well.  \n\nWhy do this shaking, pulling and fanning motion, instead of giving the noodles a dip like usual? By going through this process, the outermost layer of starch in the noodles will begin to break down slightly ‚Äì to your eye it‚Äôll look like the noodle‚Äôs covered in little white ‚Äòspecks‚Äô. That‚Äôs a *good* thing.  When you mix everything all up, that irregular surface allows your sauce to cling to the noodles in a really nice way. \n\n1.\t*Heat your oil until it‚Äôs almost beginning to smoke, then set it aside to cool completely.* Cooked oil‚Äôll taste a bit nicer here. We‚Äôll be mixing this oil directly with the noodles later.\n\n2.\t*Boil your noodles until al dente.* Remember that fresh noodles can cook in a flash. We‚Äôre only taking this until al dente (not a touch past al dente like most Chinese noodle dishes) because the noodles will continue to cook slightly during our pulling/fanning step.\n\n3.\t*Strain, then place in a bamboo strainer or baking sheet.* Bamboo strainer would really be ideal here if you have one, as the strainer can breathe and any excess moisture‚Äôll slightly drip out in the next step. Barring that, I think a baking sheet would be good enough for government work‚Ä¶ though if you can think of any better ways to macgyver something akin to a bamboo strainer, I‚Äôm all ears!\n\n4.\t*Pull, shake, and fan your noodles‚Ä¶ adding half your oil after ~1 minute and the remainder another minute later. Continue this motion for about ~8 more minutes.* This motion is a bit difficult to describe, so take a look at [4:24 in the video](https://youtu.be/95ENQDE7nvg?t=4m24s) for a visual.  What you‚Äôre looking for is the noodles to be cool, loose, relatively separate, and have those starchy ‚Äòspecks‚Äô we talked about earlier.\n\nMix immediately, or you can toss the noodles in the fridge until you‚Äôre ready to eat.\n\n**Ingredients, Seasoning and Sauces for Sichuan Cold Noodles:**\n\nAgain, a lot of this is personal preference. Like sesame paste over sesame oil? Go for it.\n\n1.\t*Seasoned soy sauce mixture: 500g light soy sauce (ÁîüÊäΩ), ~1 cup water, 25g scallions - green part only (Ëë±), 2 inch knob of ginger (Âßú), 8g star anise (ÂÖ´Ëßí), 5g cinnamon stick (Ê°ÇÁöÆ), 1 black cardamom pod (ËçâÊûú), 100g brown sugar (Á∫¢Á≥ñ) -or- slab sugar, 2 tbsp shajiang a.k.a. sand ginger powder (Ê≤ôÂßú).* So we‚Äôre going to be simmering this all together and straining it. If you can‚Äôt find that shajiang (great ingredient, by the way), you could try subbing it with four parts galangal powder to one part white pepper powder‚Ä¶ or alternatively just skip it. Ditto with black cardamom ‚Äì if you can‚Äôt find it, don‚Äôt tear your hair out‚Ä¶ just skip it. Note that many people don‚Äôt even add any spices to this, but‚Ä¶ this rendition‚Äôs awesome.\n\n2.\t*Garlic water, made from ¬Ω head of garlic and ~¬Ω cup cool water.* This garlic water is basically just‚Ä¶ pounded garlic mixed with water. Easy enough.\n\n3.\t*Sichuan peppercorns (Ëä±Ê§í), ~3 tbsp.* Will be toasted and ground into a powder.\n\n4.\t*Dark Chinese Vinegar (ÈôàÈÜã/È¶ôÈÜã), to taste, ~7.5 tbsp.* About 1.5 tbsp per bowl, or more or less to taste. Preferably Shanxi mature vinegar (i.e. chencu), but Chinkiang vinegar (i.e. xiangcu) would also do.\n\n5.\t*Toasted Sesame Oil (È∫ªÊ≤π), to taste, ~2.5 tbsp.* About ¬Ω tsp per bowl, or more or less to taste.\n\n6.\t*Youlazi Chili Oil: 3 tbsp chili flakes (Ëæ£Ê§íÁ≤â), optional 2 star anise (ÂÖ´Ëßí), optional small sprinkle Sichuan peppercorn (Ëä±Ê§í), 50g Caiziyou (ËèúÁ±ΩÊ≤π) -or- Indian Mustard Seed oil -or- Peanut oil (Ëä±ÁîüÊ≤π).* Ok, so for this dish we‚Äôre just going to make a quick-and-dirty chili oil called ‚Äòyoulazi‚Äô. If you‚Äôve seen any recipes for Chinese chili oil online, it‚Äôs probably this type‚Ä¶ basically just some hot oil drizzled into chili flakes with an optional spice or two in the mix.  If you have some Sichuan ‚Äòhongyou‚Äô chili oil lying around, feel free to use that instead.\n\n7.\t*Seasoning: ¬º tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar, liberal sprinkle of MSG (Âë≥Á≤æ).* Of course, or all to taste. The sugar helps balance the vinegar and the MSG helps balance the chili oil‚Ä¶ so if you‚Äôre using more vinegar, up the sugar and if you‚Äôre using more chili oil up the MSG.\n\nNote that the seasoned soy sauce makes way more than five servings ‚Äì more like ten or fifteen. We just found that with smaller amounts it was a bit too easy for it reduce and get overly thick, unless you‚Äôre using a pot with a heavy lit. \n\n*Two more optional seasonings that we didn‚Äôt use in the video:* A Chongqing variety (interestingly) includes a bit yellow mustard in the mix, so you could also toss in ¬Ω tsp per serving if you want to give that a go. \n\nAlso, something else you‚Äôll see from time to time is mujiangzi oil (Êú®ÂßúÁ±ΩÊ≤π)‚Ä¶ i.e. the essential oil of the plant Litsea cubeba.  It‚Äôs an oil that‚Äôs used a bit in the cuisine of southwest China (especially in the Guizhou province), and has a taste very similar to lemongrass. I figure that sourcing that mujiangzi oil would be a distant dream to source outside of China, so if you‚Äôd like to give that a try, you could also give lemongrass oil a whirl. Either way, only use a touch ‚Äì like, literally a drop or two is enough.\n\n**Process, Seasonings and Sauces for Sichuan Cold Noodles:**\n\n1.\t*Make the garlic water: peel and pound the garlic until relatively pasty, then mix the water into it.* Set aside to soak until you‚Äôre ready to eat. We‚Äôre using cool water here because we want the bite of the raw garlic.\n\n2.\t*Make the seasoned soy sauce mixture: add all the ingredients to a pot, get it up to a boil, then cover and simmer it at the lowest your stove‚Äôll go for 45 minutes.* Note that if you were following along in the video, we actually halved this for the camera. We‚Äôd recommend these portions we listed above else, again, it‚Äôs easy for this seasoned soy sauce to get overly thick.\n\n3.\t*Strain the seasoned soy sauce mixture.* Set aside to cool.\n\n4.\t*Make the Youlazi chili oil: add the chili flakes, the star anise, and the Sichuan peppercorns to a bowl. Heat up the 50g of oil until it‚Äôs beginning to smoke, then drizzle into the chili flakes.* Hot oil hitting chili flakes must be one of the top-10 most satisfying things in cooking, right up there with the sizzle of onions hitting a pan. Set it aside to cool, picking out the star anise before using.\n\n5.\t*Toast and grind the Sichuan peppercorns.* If not using powder, give the Sichuan peppercorns a quick toast over medium-low heat for about two minutes. Transfer to a mortar, and grind down into a powder.\n\nFor everything else, just set it all out into little bowls to get ready to serve.\n\n**Toppings, Sichuan Cold Noodles:**\n\n1.\t*Mungbean Sprouts (ÁªøË±ÜËäΩ), 150g.* Will be quickly blanched in hot water.\n2.\t*Cucumber (ÈªÑÁìú), ¬Ω.* Finely julienned. An Asian cucumber‚Äôs best (not as watery), but an English cucumber would also be totally fine.\n3.\t*Peanuts, ~1/4 cup.* Toasted, peeled, then pounded until crushed.\n4.\t*Green onion (Ëë±), ~3 sprigs.* Sliced and sprinkled on top.\n\n*Two more common toppings that we didn‚Äôt include in the video:* Another hyper-common addition is reconstituted dried kelp strips (Êµ∑Â∏¶) ‚Äì obviously, feel free to add it in if you‚Äôd like. Shredded chicken‚Äôs another frequent sight, and pretty tasty too.\n\nWhy didn‚Äôt we use these two? No reason, really. We just didn‚Äôt want to call for like a million different toppings (probably already playing footsie with that line) and we personally like this with sprouts/cucumber/peanuts/scallion.\n\n**Process, Toppings for Sichuan Cold Noodles:**\n\n1.\t*Blanch the mungbean sprouts: toss in boiling water for ~20 seconds, then transfer to a bowl of cool water.*\n\n2.\t*Prep the peanuts: toast over medium-low heat for ~5 minutes until browned, peel, and then pound in a mortar til crushed.* You don‚Äôt need to go too crazy crushing the peanuts‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not looking for a powder here!\n\n3.\t*Thinly julienne the cucumbers, thinly slice the scallions.*\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n\nToss about a fifth of your noodles (100g) in a bowl. Now, you got two options: do you want to make everything all pretty, and impress everyone on Instagram? If the answer is yes, then:\n\n* Nestle in a small handful of blanched mungbeans on top.\n\n* Drizzle about a tablespoon of the garlic water (smashed garlic inclusive) over the noodles and the mungbeans.\n\n* Drizzle about two tablespoons of the seasoned soy sauce mixture around the sides of the noodles to have a bit of a ‚Äòpool‚Äô of sauce.\n\n* Do the same with about 1.5 tbsp of the dark Chinese vinegar.\n\n* Add the salt, sugar, and MSG on top.\n\n* Drizzle about one teaspoon sesame oil all over the noodles.\n\n* Sprinkle on the toasted pounded peanuts, to taste.\n\n* Sprinkle on ¬Ω tsp of the toasted Sichuan peppercorn powder.\n\n* Lay a small handful of the julienned cucumber on top.\n\n* Pour about a tablespoon of the youlazi chili oil on top.\n\n* Sprinkle on a bit of the scallion slices.\n\nThat all gets mixed together literally right before devouring, so you obviously don‚Äôt need to go in that order unless you wanna take food pics lol. Just mix all your shit together and enjoy is a just as, if not more, correct way to go about things.\n\n**Note on how to serve:**\n\nSo like practically all street snacks, making Liangmian at home is a maddening combination of ‚Äòsimple to whip up‚Äô and ‚Äòkind of a pain in the ass‚Äô.  It‚Äôs not difficult, but there is sort of a bunch of prep to take care of.\n\nSo while not necessarily something we‚Äôd make on a weeknight, this is a *great* dish to bring to barbecues and potlucks.  Prepare little bowls with all the seasonings and toppings‚Ä¶ and make a little ‚Äònoodle bar‚Äô of sorts with ingredients for people to toss in and mix according to their tastes. Kinda fun, impressive looking, and not too much work. This stuff would all keep overnight, so you could prep everything the night before and toss in your fridge... if bringing to a barbecue, keeping in a cooler until right before serving would probably be a smart idea.\n\nIf you‚Äôre doubling the recipe for an event or something, remember that with the amounts given here, you‚Äôll have extra seasoned soy sauce‚Ä¶ so you won't need to double that.

    "body": "It sounds like this compound has a lot of potential. It's as reportedly as effective as DEET or picaradin and lasts just as long. The only potential downside for the backcountry would be the grapefruit scent. Either way, it's nice to see a new alternative come to the market.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/health/tick-mosquito-repellant-nootkatone.html\n\n> The E.P.A. has approved nootkatone, which is found in cedars and grapefruit. It repels ticks, mosquitoes and other dangerous bugs for hours, but is safe enough to eat.\n\n> Adding a new weapon to the fight against insect-borne illnesses like Lyme disease and malaria, the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday approved a new chemical that both repels and kills ticks and mosquitoes.\n\n> The chemical, nootkatone, an oil found in cedar trees and grapefruits, is so safe that it is used by the food and perfume industries.\n\n> Nootkatone is considered nontoxic to humans and other mammals, birds, fish and bees, the E.P.A. said in a statement.\n\n> Diseases caused by the bites of ticks, mosquitoes and fleas have tripled in the United States in the last 15 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a 2018 report. They include Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever from ticks; West Nile, dengue, Zika and chikungunya from mosquitoes; and plague from fleas.\n\n> In tropical countries, malaria and yellow fever are major killers; elephantiasis is also spread by mosquitoes. Lethal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is spread by ticks, and kala azar is spread by sandflies.\n\n> Manuel F. Lluberas, a public health entomologist who has worked on mosquito-control campaigns all over the world, said he hoped that nootkatone would be accepted by people who fear synthetic repellents and that it could be made cheaply enough to be bought by foreign aid programs like the President‚Äôs Malaria Initiative.\n\n> The E.P.A. registration applies only to nootkatone as an active ingredient, the statement said. Any formulations using it in the future will have to be tested and registered separately.\n\n> The chemical repels mosquitoes, ticks, bedbugs and fleas ‚Äî and, in high concentrations, kills them, according to the C.D.C. It may also be effective against lice, sandflies, midges and other pests, some of which can carry lethal diseases.\n\n> It is not oily, lasts for hours and has a pleasant grapefruit-like scent, said Ben Beard, deputy director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the C.D.C.\n\n> ‚ÄúIf you drink Fresca or Squirt, you‚Äôve drunk nootkatone,‚Äù Dr. Beard said.\n\n> Nootkatone works differently from previous classes of insecticides and can kill bugs that are resistant to DDT, pyrethroids and other common insecticides.\n\n> Experts in insect-borne diseases greeted the news with cautious enthusiasm.\n\n> ‚ÄúIts use as an insecticidal soap has great potential,‚Äù said Duane J. Gubler, a former C.D.C. chief of vector-borne diseases.\n\n> One proposed use is in soaps that people in tick-infested areas could shower with, repelling and possibly killing ticks that try to attach to them.\n\n> Joel R. Coats, a specialist in insect toxicology at Iowa State University, said his lab had tested nootkatone and found it to be ‚Äúan impressive repellent but a weak insecticide.‚Äù\n\n> It repels ticks even better than synthetics like DEET, picaridin or IR3535 do, Dr. Coats said, and it is their equal at repelling mosquitoes.\n\n> Unlike citronella, peppermint oil, lemongrass oil and other repellents based on plant oils, he added, nootkatone does not lose its potency after about an hour, but lasts as long as the synthetics.\n\n> But although it can also kill insects, he said, doing that takes so much of the chemical that it may not be practical.\n\n> ‚ÄúMost plant terpenes will kill bugs if you go to a high enough dose, but I haven‚Äôt seen any data that supports using it as an insecticide,‚Äù Dr. Coats said, using a term for aromatic oils exuded by many plants to repel invasive insects. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen lots of data on it as a repellent.‚Äù\n\n> Mikkel Vestergaard-Frandsen, owner of the Vestergaard company, which makes insecticide-impregnated nets to fight malaria, said he was interested in the compound, but wanted to know more about it.\n\n> Because babies sleep under the nets, any insecticide in them must be very safe.\n\n> In many areas, mosquitoes have developed resistance to the pyrethin-based insecticides now used in nets, which are synthetic versions of a chemical found in chrysanthemum flowers.\n\n> A version of nootkatone that can linger in netting fabric for years would have to be developed, but good repellents usually dissolve too quickly for that, he said.\n\n> The C.D.C. discovered nootkatone‚Äôs repellent properties almost 25 years ago as part of a search for new tick-control compounds to fight Lyme disease, Dr. Beard said.\n\n> They investigated cedar bark and chips ‚Äúbecause there are all these folk tales that cedar repels insects ‚Äî and people keep their clothes in cedar chests,‚Äù he said.\n\n> Cedar wood itself had very little effect on ticks, he said, but Oregon State University scientists working with the agency found the terpene oil of the Alaskan yellow cedar to be powerfully repellent. The Latin name of the tree is Cupressus nootkatensis, which comes from the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people of Canada.\n\n> It is ‚Äúnot known in great detail‚Äù how nootkatone works, Dr. Beard said, but it appears to activate octopamine receptors, which in insects send electrical impulses from one nerve cell to the next. Unable to turn off the signal, the bugs twitch to death.\n\n> In mammals, adrenaline ‚Äî which is chemically related to octopamine ‚Äî performs the same function. But the compound does not trigger adrenaline receptors.\n\n> Later the agency realized that the same chemical, originally derived from grapefruit rinds, was used as a flavoring and in perfumes.\n\n> The C.D.C. licensed its patent to a Swiss company, Evolva, which isolates the chemical from fermenting yeast.\n\n> But doing the safety studies required for E.P.A. registration was too expensive until the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic came along, Dr. Beard said.\n\n> That epidemic prodded Congress to appropriate money for mosquito control, and the C.D.C. transferred some of it to BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which contracted with Evolva to finish the research.\n\n> Zika funding ‚Äúwas the key to moving the boulder up the hill,‚Äù Dr. Beard said. But since nootkatone works well on both insects, he added, ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt a bait-and-switch.‚Äù",

I test insect repellents daily, and have repeatedly found that DEET is the only true ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù out there, at least when it comes to topical repellents. By all means, try nootkatone-based repellents when they become available, but don‚Äôt expect them to be all the same or as good as DEET.

    "body": "I've been taking a lot of hot baths lately due to an injury. About a week ago after work, I was prepping for my daily soak, and pulled back the curtain to find a dying, flailing cockroach. I live in New Orleans so roaches are common, but they still piss me off when they're indoors. Furious, I flung the thing into the toilet, grabbed a bottle of bleach and doused the tub. Overkill, I know, but I had found three of them in the last two days so I overreacted. I let the bleach soak for a while then rinsed the tub and started my bath. I often use epsom salt in my bath, especially with said injury, so I poured some into the water along with a few drops of essential oil and swished it around. Walked away to undress, came back, and the water was yellow. Like, urine yellow. This should have been my first clue that something was wrong, but I shrugged it off and got in the tub. Within a minute or so, my skin started feeling very hot and tingly...clue #2. Oh well, I guess I made the water hotter than usual. I ignored the tingling and started playing around on my phone. I look down, and my skin was now bright red. I'm very sensitive to hot water but no big deal, it'll cool off soon enough. I continued scrolling through social media. A short time after that, I glanced away from my phone and noticed a few spots on my thighs that were even redder than the rest of my skin. That's when I realized that my skin was really starting to burn. There was definitely something wrong. I sat up on my knees and examined my body, which was now completely covered in deep red hives. Oh fuck.\n\nInitially, my dumb ass thought I was having an allergic reaction to the lemongrass oil. I had used it a number of times before, but this was a new bottle and maybe there was some additive that I was allergic to. Or maybe the bag of epsom salt I just bought was tainted. Maybe someone poisoned my water supply. I have really bad anxiety and I think stupid things when I'm panicking, so anything was a possibility in my mind. I turned on the shower and rinsed myself as much as I could in a full tub. The hives were getting worse. I tried to remain calm as I called my boyfriend at work, who said he'd leave immediately. Next I called my mother, a nurse, and had a complete meltdown. I was feeling dizzy and nauseated; surely I was dying. She and my dad (a physician) advised me to take double the recommended dose of benadryl and lie down. I sobbed into the phone. \n\n\"Are you sure you rinsed the tub well enough? There was probably some bleach left which reacted with the epsom salt.\"\n\nShit. I got off the phone and Googled \"bleach and epsom salt\" and the first result was a news story about a sick, twisted couple who threw their disabled daughter in a bathtub full of the concoction, and her skin basically melted. Yep, definitely dying. \n\nI took the benadryl, got in bed and cried until I became too groggy to think. By the time my boyfriend got home, the hives were gone, the redness had completely cleared and I was no longer feeling sick. My skin was irritated for a few days, especially my lady bits as I had just had a Brazilian wax that day, but I did not die. \n\nI know, I'm a dumb ass. And a spaz.\n\n\nTL;DR Took a bath with epsom salt and a trace of bleach, reacted terribly, had a panic attack, then fell asleep after drugging myself. Am fine now. ",

We'll call her Bathilda, or Batty for short.  For the first couple months, she just seemed a bit weird, but she left me alone.  Oh, how I long for those days.  I long for the days when I'd just see her when she came to complain about the noise level in our lobby - and she's not wrong, our GM might be deaf, dear reader.  But she took it a little far.\n\nAnyway, she came down the other night and was talking with the person I was shift changing with.  Batty was talking about some pretty run of the mill political stuff.  Now, I enjoy political discussions, so I made a comment.  By whatever you hold sacred, dear readers, NEVER DO THIS.  You see, I was agreeing with her, so I figured it was safe.  And I had some information to elaborate on things.\n\nThis was Sunday night.  She has since come down every night to talk with me about other topics that interest her.  UFOs(I've always been a mild enthusiast, so fine), demons(I play TTRPG.  And I'm Catholic, so oookayyy, I guess?), diet(Keto and Carnivore are my enthusiasms, and she's been interested in those) and then it gets weird.\n\nApparently she's been chosen by Good(not God, who is also evil, apparently), but Good itself.  Good is gonna annihilate all products of evil.  Which means us and all of reality.  Apparently evil spirits attack her for talking about the truth.  And Good protects her from damage, but lets her show the symptoms so that evil doesn't know it is ineffective.  It seems gravity will turn off when the magnetic poles shift, according to someone she watches probably too much of on the internet.\n\nBatty hasn't been to a doctor in over a decade(no, really?), loves essential oils(gets into arguments with people on the internet about them, even) and is probably an anti-vaxxer(I haven't asked, because I used to kill time screwing with those people on Twitter for lulz).\n\nSo, dear reader, where did I mess up?  Well, you see, sometimes a completely batcrap insane internet person will also have moderately normal political views.  You know the type.  And if their disciples mistake your agreement with those fairly normal views, well, you're obvious clued in on the truth of the world.  And don't think that your views(aside from complete non-caring) make you safe.  Trust me, I've met people of all affiliations who are a few crayons short of an LA Beast eating challenge.  But I'd never made the mistake of agreeing with anything they'd said.\n\nDon't ever talk about politics at work, no matter how safe it seems.  Lest you meet Batty.\n\nPray for me.  I have no idea how to shake this.  Considering learning conversational Latin and responding to everything she says in Latin, but then she'd probably stab me in the chest with a yew wood stake covered in lemongrass oil or something.",

I‚Äôve spent a small fortune trying all sorts of treatments and styling techniques with mild to moderate success or none at all.\n\nMy hair is also thinning so separate from that I‚Äôve been doing rosemary oil very sporadically on just the scalp and using castor oil as a carrier, just for hair growth. Then whilst researching I came across videos with people using many different oils to condition the whole hair so I decided to add some more types in seen as I was doing it anyway, doing scalp stimulation with it and also applying to the whole hair length. And I started doing it as much as I could before every wash and it became a nice little routine. \n\nWithin just a handful of times of doing it my hair is literally back to how it used to be many years ago, silky, soft, shiny, sleek, manageable, and with body and ‚Äúguts‚Äù to it (despite still being as thin of course - I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll help with that because I have health issues that cause hair loss). \n\nBlow drying it has become a dream again. I actually look like I‚Äôve had a keratin treatment compared to just the other week where it was frizzy, unruly, unhealthy and just awful looking and wouldn‚Äôt cooperate with anything. I always had naturally straight hair but it‚Äôs gone wavy in recent years due to hormonal changes, but after the oiling treatments it blow dries straight with total ease and doesn‚Äôt instantly start getting unruly and kinking up like it has been doing all this time even after I had used ColorWow Dreamcoat or hairspray. I‚Äôve been out all day today and it‚Äôs as straight and sleek as when I left the house with no products used except heat protectant. \n\nI feel so stupid as I‚Äôm indian and grew up oiling my hair as a child (I had the thickest longest hair ever, I used to want it thinned out and now I mourn it!) and then also picked it up again in my 20s for awhile. I don‚Äôt know why I ever stopped, it‚Äôs clearly what my hair needs and I‚Äôve read previously that Indian hair texture does really benefit from hair oiling in a way that others might not as much, but I got swayed by all the other information out there about products that are marketed more in the West and thinking the answer lay there. \n\nI‚Äôm just so relieved I‚Äôve found my way back as I was starting to think my hair was screwed up forever due to health issues and it was consuming me. I feel a bit more like me again through this and that‚Äôs worth so much when you‚Äôve lost a lot of yourself. \n\nThe oils I‚Äôve been using mixed together - Castor oil, olive oil, rosemary oil, pumpkin oil, black seed oil, jojoba oil and lemongrass oil. \n\nThe before photos are all from the last few weeks, and when I‚Äôve actually styled my hair to go out as best I can and it‚Äôs become unruly soon as I‚Äôve left. I had also done a protein treatment and Olaplex during that time and using conditioning masks all the time.\n\n",

But it‚Äôs a bit bemusing being told I don‚Äôt have a thinning scalp when it‚Äôs this upsetting everyday! I don‚Äôt think anyone wants to pretend to have balding areas, it‚Äôs not exactly a coveted thing to boast about?\n\nAnd this is a pretty good hair day still as I did a proper a blow dry yesterday getting volume into the roots and used dry shampoo so it‚Äôs not exposing as much scalp as it would otherwise. If I could I‚Äôd wear my hair toppers everyday but it‚Äôs too uncomfortable so I only wear them on special occasions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xsepa08lnkpd1.jpeg?width=981&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=819d4dd9be7e8106e27a8fb38beda0dd3bf1a172",

        "body": "From the University of Maine:\n\n<As a result of increasing concerns regarding environmental safety, increasing costs of chemical controls, and potential resistance of ticks to pesticides, biological controls are becoming a sought-after strategy for tick population management. The use of biological controls for tick management is relatively new and is primarily in its research phase. A number of predators, parasites, and pathogens are currently being evaluated for their potential as effective tick biological controls.\n\nPredators\n\nTicks have a variety of natural predators including ants, spiders, and birds, though most are generalists that only occasionally feed on ticks. As such, these generalist predators tend to be ineffective at significantly reducing tick populations. Guinea fowl and chickens are commonly promoted as tick controls, though research indicates that their tick consumption is minimal and is not effective in reducing local tick populations. Additionally, as guinea fowl wander around a property they can become hosts to ticks themselves, further reducing their value as a biological control. An increase in wild turkey populations has led to questions regarding their impact on tick numbers. Though turkeys will consume ticks on occasion, turkey foraging has not been found to reduce tick abundance and they too can become hosts to a number of tick species.\n\nParasites\n\nResearch and limited releases of a tiny parasitic wasp (Ixodiphagus hookeri) have shown some minor potential for reduction of deer tick populations. Unfortunately, this wasp requires extremely high tick densities to persist, limiting its usefulness as a biological control in most settings. Nematodes, a type of tiny roundworm, are also being examined as a potential tick control, though they may be too sensitive to colder temperatures to be effective in Maine.\n\nPathogenic Fungi\n\nThe use of pathogenic fungi is perhaps the most promising biological control for ticks. These fungi penetrate the tick‚Äôs cuticle, or outer covering, move into the body, and ultimately kill both nymphal and adult stages of the tick. Commercial products containing these fungi are available for both granular and spray applications. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is registered in Maine for tick control.>",

The more we spray pesticides, the more we harm insect biodiversity, and the more pest species like ticks will continue to rise. Spray more, and we probably have more ticks and more with Lyme, putting us on the ‚Äúpesticide treadmill.‚Äù\n\nPesticides appear to work to people, but they may actually increase populations and % with Lyme. They do not actually reduce risk of Lyme. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26740276/\n\nSolving the problem by adding biodiversity and creating healthy habitat won‚Äôt be an instant or 100% reduction, but it will probably be a better long-term strategy.

I had a huge tick problem with my dog as this is what I've done.\n\n1. Get your dog the Lyme disease vaccine. This is not a \"core\" vaccine given to dogs, but it is available and will mitigate the biggest risk of ticks for your dogs. Before your dog is protected, I'd keep it out of the grass and on a leash when out. \n2. Keep your dog's hair as short as possible. \n3. Keep your dog up to date on its tick medications. I think the topical ones work better.\n4. Also spray your dog with a natural tick repellant meant for dogs every time you go out. Obviously, DEET is dangerous for dogs since they lick themselves, but I've had a lot of success with the peppermint/lemongrass/orange mixtures, and they smell great. Do not be shy about applying it. Focus especially on the legs, tail and belly. Put some on your hands and smear it on the ears and ridge of the muzzle (this is where I've noticed ticks love to congregate).\n5. Try to keep your dog out of the really long grass while out. \n6. Brush your dog after going out, and check for ticks.\n7.

I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research and getting the garden ready. There‚Äôs a wildflower patch, with a mini pond in there, and plenty of bee-friendly plants, so I‚Äôve seen a fair few pollinators around recently.\n\nBut today, I noticed something a bit different ‚Äî multiple bees going in and out of the roof of my DIY double bird box. It‚Äôs not perfectly sealed (classic DIY), and there‚Äôs a small gap under the roof that they seem to love. I‚Äôm guessing this is a swarm from somewhere nearby that‚Äôs found a new home? The birds never moved in, so I guess the bees got tired of waiting and just claimed it on a technicality. üòÖ\n\nHere‚Äôs my question:\nShould I buy and place a nuc box on top of the shed above the bird box to try and lure them in with some lemongrass oil? I assume the bird box isn‚Äôt going to cut it long-term once they start expanding, and it would be amazing to catch a swarm and save myself ¬£400 on buying a nuc next spring üòÇ\n\nAny tips from experienced beekeepers would be hugely appreciated! I‚Äôd love to give them a proper home and potentially move them into a hive later on.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

First day I used it, dog immediatly became disinterested after running full force and getting a wiff of the lemongrass oil I rubbed into my hands and clothing. I was so happy! I thought, now I can have arms and legs exposed during hot months. \n\nHowever, today it...just didn't work. My arms were full as I walked in the door and had to raise my knees and literally hold the dog away with my extended leg. What happened? I really had to defend myself and despite the dog falling down after sliding off of my knee repeatedly. Usually I just do the regular push off moves, but today I felt like I was really defending myself and belongings. \n\nDid not wanting to jump on me yesterday piss the dog off? Did I not use enough oil? \n\nI think the oil method is BRILLIANT! It may be a permanent solution for many dogs, this one is just HIGH energy. Hopefully today was just an outlier. I will add to to this post tomorrow or friday after I observe my results again. \n\nI really wish I wasnt so intimidated by high energy dogs. But I am. And as most of you know, dogs are being integrated more into every facet of life. It can feel like theres no way to escape it.

I've used Hydrocortisone and T-Gel on my scalp and chin for about 3 years and they never really helped much, just alleviated itching for the first day or hours after application.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI read a thread about MCT oil's combative properties against Malassezia and it had me thinking to look up what else might combat it. After some research on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/ijyldb/looking_beyond_malassezia/) and [that](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/504316) I created my own treatment oil, that actually doubles great as a beard oil! I used [this MCT Oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BC7Q4QS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and bought a generic essential oil kit from Amazon, and got a 1 oz dropper bottle and filled it with 1 oz of MCT, and added (approximately) 6 drops of Lemongrass Oil, 4 drops of Sweet Orange Oil, and 8 drops of Tea Tree oil. This formula theoretically (aside from the Sweet Orange) is formulated to combat Malassezia directly, and smells just like the lemon lollipops you get from banks!\n\nI've been adding this to my beard and scalp once or twice daily for the past week, and here are my results!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jshnpdkzhen61.png?width=3136&format=png&auto=webp&s=f006e3e53a1b39791eb4ad475dbdc39e605c5d4d",

We both shower most days, and our cat likes to pee in the tub occasionally. A day or two ago we left for work in the morning, and when my fianc√©e came back that afternoon she found our bathtub suddenly had gotten covered in two types of weird stains:\n\n1. Pink-ish drip stains all along the head and foot of the tub.\n\n2. Greyish splotches all over the floor of the tub.\n\nThe water here must have something a little funky in it because the tub and our toilet have developed khahki/pinkish patches before that I haven't encountered anywhere else, but those were always spread out over a sizable area ‚Äî never dripped down the sides in streaks ‚Äî and they came off pretty easily.\n\nWe've tried scrubbing the stains and using several different cleaners, and nothing seems to be able to remove them. The grey splotches particularly seem more like places where the lining of the tub was eaten away.\n\nThere's no evidence whatsoever of anything dripping from the ceiling, or from the few shampoo bottles that are around the edge of the tub. The stains are all inside the tub.\n\nNothing else in the apartment seems to be different. We didn't do anything out-of-the-ordinary in the bathtub. There weren't any strange smells.\n\nThe only thing out-of-place was a little glass jar of bath salts was lying in the tub next to the drain. Our cat likes to knock over anything we leave around the rim of the tub. However, the lid was still on the jar, and no bath salts seemed to have spilled out.\n\nThe tub is an alcove bathtub. When I knock on the sides it sounds hollow, but the walls don't have any give.\n\nAny thoughts as to what may have happened? Like a chemical leached out of the seal or something? My best guess is that the apartment complex's maintenance people came in and did something, but nothing else seems to have changed and it would be very weird for them to not leave a note. It would suck if we got charged for this despite having no clue how it happened.\n\nThank you!\n\n**Update for anyone interested:** It's lemongrass oil! We have this \"essential oils\" lemongrass stuff and dribbled a little around the tub to try to keep the cat from peeing in it. I put another dribble on the tub earlier today, and sure enough, it's producing the same results!",

    "body": "In November 2021 I noticed some white bumps on my inner thigh, which I naively thought was from shaving. 1 Month later they started to get red, swollen, itchy and cluster together almost fusing.  These definitely were not razor burns or ingrowns. Had an STD test done and nothing was abnormal but was prescribed imiquimod for these bumps. This had no effect except mental anguish and insecurity. Over the months I tried a few things: Acivir and Lysine with no success. Benzoyl Peroxide and Salicylic very minor improvement. Apple Cider Vinegar and bandages did kill these little scourge red bumps but did nothing to the tiny white ones and it left the skin purple which took months to heal. And new ones kept emerging. \n\nFinally was recommended a persimmon bar soap off Amazon for $10 by a family member. It has Glycerin, Lemongrass Oil, Green Tea Extract and Persimmon Tannins.  Every single day, morning and night, I applied the soap dry rubbing it on the infected area. I rinsed the soap after each session and dried it in a paper towel. It leaves a waxy film on the skin that peeled off after a few days. After 1 week I noticed significant clearing. 2nd week it was almost like magic it erased most of the molluscum. 1 month later and all I could see was the red scarring from ACV. After 2 months I can say confidently it is gone. I had some curious bumps on my arm but the soap took care of it in 2 weeks. \n\nSo after a year of molluscum progressing without pause some soap did the trick. Hope it helps someone else!",

This is my story with molluscum on genitals cured with Apple Cider Vinegar.\nI am a woman in my late 20‚Äôs and I have no idea how, but ended up with molluscum on my genitals, at the top where your pubis bone is, and it spread down to my labia/around clitoris. Very distressing. What was the worst part, is not acting soon enough because I didn‚Äôt know what it was. Anyway, go to the doctor and get a diagnosis!\n\nhow I fixed it:\n\nI tried impromoid 5% from the doctor - didn‚Äôt work. This is designed to make your body attack and kick start your immune system. Used for warts. No success.\n\nI tried mollenol patches and mollenol sensitive liquid, also did nothing. Made it red, but the bumps didn‚Äôt go away.\n\nI was desperate, so after reading earth clinic I tried apple cider vinegar. I would put apple cider vinegar on a circle makeup pad, then put it inside tight underwear so it stayed in place. I didn‚Äôt dilute it, it stung, so it‚Äôs best if you dilute it in case you cause serious irritation.\n\nI did this for 3 days, 3x a day or whenever I remembered. It stung like crazy by day 4 so I had to stop. I kept going with this for 2 weeks, stopping when it became irritated. All the molluscum gets big and white, absorbing the liquid, then it turns yellow and black, scabs, and that‚Äôs the end.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt believe how quick it worked. It looks gross while healing, inflamed and marks from the scabs, but it gets rid of it. I‚Äôm so grateful. It‚Äôs a quick solution and although it hurts, it‚Äôs worth the pain.\n\nMC seriously damaged my mental health. It‚Äôs so hard because doctors don‚Äôt really take it seriously because it just ‚Äúgoes away on its own‚Äù sometimes taking up to four years, I seriously couldn‚Äôt have coped with that.\n\nAll up I was cured in 2 months. 2 weeks from the ACV.\n\nOther things I did:\n\n- took vitamin c tablets, zinc, lysine, turmeric.\n- 1 shot of ACV and one glass of water daily.\n-cover them in pimple patches daily! The thick ones, that are circles. This stops the spread. \n\nBest of luck!!!",

They‚Äôre a reflection of our overall health and self-care.\n\nFor years, I struggled with brittle, weak nails that would chip, break, or peel no matter how much I tried to care for them. I tried everything‚Äînail strengtheners, biotin supplements, and even DIY remedies‚Äîbut nothing seemed to work long-term.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I stumbled upon ***Pronail Complex***, a dietary supplement promising to transform nail health from the inside out.\n\nAt first, I was skeptical. I‚Äôd been let down by similar products before, but something about Pronail Complex‚Äôs natural ingredient list and positive reviews caught my attention. I decided to give it a shot, and what followed was a journey that completely changed how I view nail care.\n\nIn this review, I‚Äôll share my firsthand experience with Pronail Complex‚Äîwhat it is, how it works, and whether it lives up to the hype.

My Personal Experience\n\nWhen I first heard about Pronail Complex, I‚Äôll admit I was skeptical. I‚Äôve tried countless nail treatments in the past‚Äîcreams, polishes, supplements‚Äîand none of them delivered the results they promised.\n\nSo, when I came across Pronail Complex, I decided to give it a fair shot, but with realistic expectations. After using it consistently for a month, here‚Äôs my honest take:\n\n**My One-Month Experience with Pronail Complex**\n\n**Week 1**:\n\nI started using Pronail Complex as directed‚Äîspraying it on my nails 2-3 times a day, especially after showering. The first thing I noticed was how lightweight and non-greasy the formula felt. It absorbed quickly, and I didn‚Äôt have to worry about sticky residue or staining my socks. Within a few days, my nails felt slightly smoother, but I didn‚Äôt see any dramatic changes yet.\n\n**Week 2:**\n\nBy the second week, I began to notice small improvements. My nails, which were usually prone to peeling and breaking, felt stronger. I didn‚Äôt experience any new breaks, which was a big win for me. The skin around my nails also felt softer and more hydrated, thanks to the moisturizing oils in the formula.\n\n**Week 3**:\n\nThis is when I started to see visible changes. My nails looked shinier and healthier, and the white spots that had been bothering me for months began to fade.\n\nI also noticed that my nails were growing faster than usual, and the edges weren‚Äôt as jagged or uneven.\n\n**Week 4**:\n\nAfter a full month of use, I can confidently say that Pronail Complex has made a noticeable difference. My nails are stronger, smoother, and less prone to breakage. The fungal issues I had been dealing with (yellowing and thickening) also improved significantly. While my nails aren‚Äôt perfect yet, the progress I‚Äôve seen in just four weeks is impressive.\n\n# Is Pronail Complex Legit?\n\nBased on my experience, Pronail Complex is definitely not a scam. It‚Äôs a legitimate product that delivers real results when used consistently. While it may not work overnight, the gradual improvements I‚Äôve seen in my nail health are proof that it works.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tgv8f6xmvgoe1.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d619a8853261694bb9a36b0b1d6895640db96fa\n\n# Pricing: How Much Does It's Cost?\n\nPronail Complex offers flexible pricing options to suit your needs.

Who are you and what are you working on?\n\nHello, it‚Äôs lovely to have a chance to talk with other people in the same start up mode as myself.\n\nThe [Lemongrass Trading Company](https://www.lemongrasstrading.com/) is in the business of making chemical-free and effective natural insecticides & fresheners that are safe, green and eco-friendly. \n\nYou might think that \"safe to breathe\" was a basic necessity of sprays & fragrances but -amazingly- many household and insect products are actually toxic. We use only pure, natural Lemongrass, plus other plant extracts ‚Äì incidentally, Lemongrass happens to smell wonderful too, so people love our Car, Bathroom and Air Fresheners! We target Clothes Moths, Mosquitoes, Midges, Wasps and for a safer horticulture, we make an Aphid spray. All these are made without a single added chemical, artificial fragrance  or synthetic ingredient. For the Food & Drink market we make a Fly Spray out of edible ingredients, which no one seems to have thought of before. I now have best friends in pubs all over the country!\n\nThe hero product is the [Lemongrass & Cedarwood Anti-Moth Spray](https://www.lemongrasstrading.com/product/anti-moth-lemongrass-cedarwood-repellent-spray/). Since the rapid explosion of cashmere in all our lives, there has been a plague of Clothes Moths in the closets of Britain! Other existing Moth products are mostly full of harsh chemicals, and really toxic if your clothes are stored in your bedroom. I find there‚Äôs a new awareness and a real hunger for natural products, from a wide range of customers. \n\nI was fortunate to get a grant from the [European Union for Innovation in Agriculture](https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/european-innovation-partnership-agricultural), and began to work with the amazing Department of Parasitology at the University of Bristol. My commercial high point occurred when the Fashion Editor of The London Times featured Lemongrass as her Weapon of Moth Destruction. We were inundated with orders, proving the demand for a more chemical-free environment.\n\n### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?\n\nIt happened when I was in rural South India. I was doing some agricultural research in a chemically-saturated environment, which was both bankrupting and poisoning the poor farmers. I learned that traditionally Lemongrass was used as an insecticide and a food preservative for its general antibacterial and antifungal powers. (Did you know it‚Äôs an ingredient in [Dettol](http://www.dettol.co.uk/)?) \n\nA Farmers‚Äô Cooperative was wheeling past me with a bamboo cart piled with produce, and ‚Äì more useful for a traveler ‚Äì small bottles of their own essential oils. I loved the Lemongrass oil and thought I‚Äôd use it as a food ingredient, but realized that it was a brilliant natural insecticide, and started to use it against Mosquitoes and Flies.\n\nI had no background in chemistry, in business, or in manufacturing. But I‚Äôve always believed that if you can read, you can do anything. \n\nSo I began learning about Active Ingredients, Emulsifiers, High-Shear Mixers, the life-cycle of the Fruit Fly ‚Ä¶ honestly, if ever there was ever a problem, I would just look up the answer. That‚Äôs one of the most important tips I have for other entrepreneurs, just look it up!\n\nI started reading - academic papers, books on ‚ÄòGreen Chemistry‚Äô, on branding, on bar codes, on shelf-life, on SEO, on marketing. \n\nAt the same time I was finding out how to mix oil and water, what bottles and sprays and caps and boxes were available. Sometimes it seemed overwhelming, and of course there were expensive mistakes: for example, I started with glass bottles (recyclable) but they are expensive and heavy to mail, and they shatter. I try not to waste anything, so I use them still, not for products but for batch experiments in the lab.\n\nThe governmental ‚ÄòInnovation For Growth‚Äô grant I mentioned was important not so much for the money as for it was in validating the product. This level of Laboratory testing gave us real gravitas which was vital (and helped me to have confidence).\n\nAs far as my financial situation at the time - I had a not-very-good pension but my husband was still working, so I was able to use the pension money for the business as it arrived.\n\n### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.\n\nThis was the most fun ever! \n\nSomehow, almost miraculously, I found two brilliant designers who had just left [Nottingham Trent Art School](https://www4.ntu.ac.uk/art/index.html) (prestigious in the UK for product design). I owe so much to their work that I‚Äôd like to name them here: Lun Yau and Claire Coulthard.\n\nI wanted the bottles to look as though Lemongrass was growing all around them, and once that was established, they designed the logo and the labels for each individual product. I went to trade shows to source packaging, boxes, sprays, label printers etc.\n\nThe main problem is one of scale ‚Äì for example, you can‚Äôt afford 10,000 boxes before you have made a sale. You just have to find the best price for a quantity you hope you can afford. That pretty much ruled out China, and anyway for green reasons I try to source locally.\n\n> I had no background in chemistry, in business, or in manufacturing. But I‚Äôve always believed that if you can read, you can do anything. \n\nThe same problem applies to manufacturing. Naturally, factories want to deal in large quantities. By then I had a modest quantity of the Essential Oils I thought I‚Äôd be using, imported from India, and as I‚Äôd devised the formulae with the University of Bristol, I decided to mix the stuff on site. I sourced a really good second-hand mixer from a lab in Cambridge and just started. I was scared of it to start with but now I trust it absolutely. \n\nAs far as startup costs, the mixer was the most expensive item. Oh, and the shipping costs of all my ingredients. Don‚Äôt think of taking shortcuts over forming a company, establishing copyrights, trademarks, logo etc - they aren‚Äôt hugely expensive, and offer a degree of protection you may well need. \n\nPatents, on the other hand, cost serious money. I consulted lawyers who said I could probably establish rights, but the general advice is that it would cost far too much to be worth it. Whoever has the deepest pockets wins. Regulations are quite a bugbear - very strict in Europe. But you‚Äôve probably heard of Brexit (Britain leaving the EU) so it‚Äôs all up in the air.\n\nAs William Goldman famously said of Hollywood, ‚ÄòNo one knows anything‚Äô, so I‚Äôm just carrying on!\n\n### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.\n\nFairs were a good place to start for the business. I‚Äôve almost always made quite a bit of profit at fairs, mainly in London, though they are hard work. \n\nIt‚Äôs really useful to get to talk to your customers, and see what sells though that definitely differs from the online sales. I have very loyal customers, who‚Äôve ordered steadily from me since we met at a charity fair in Chelsea. So I have always had both a website and a ‚Äòreal‚Äô presence. One Christmas I shared a pop-up shop in Piccadilly - that was terrific fun, but I think a permanent shop would be very difficult, as the High Street dies away.\n\nMy website has undergone several changes. To start, I used a local firm, but when I got national press coverage, the site collapsed under the pressure. I switched to [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com), which worked well, but has become too expensive. So now I have a great designer in Australia (not sure how that happened). \n\nIt‚Äôs surprising how quickly sites date, though. What looks cutting edge very quickly gets tired, and I find SEO a constant nightmare. Eternal vigilance ‚Äì but life can get in the way.\n\n### Since launch, what has worked to attract new customers?\n\nMarketing... honestly, I have come to hate the word. Especially in connection to social media.\n\nI know, I know, it‚Äôs essential. But perhaps my clients are not very media savvy. It‚Äôs hard to make waves on Twitter about Clothes Moths!\n\nBut the two huge boosts I have had have resulted from mentions in good old-fashioned print. Here is a summary of some of the marketing I‚Äôve done:\n\n1. National Newspapers: \n\n**The Times of London:** The Times is now subject to a paywall, so past articles in the archives aren‚Äôt available. But there‚Äôs a summary of the piece, by The Times‚Äôs award-winning Fashion Director, Anna Murphy, on the [Lemongrass Trading PRESS page](https://www.lemongrasstrading.com/press/ ).\n\n**The Observer** (a UK prestigious Sunday broadsheet, sister paper of The Guardian): they ran a series titled \"Green Crush of the Week\", and my Moth products caught their eye. [Give it a read](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/04/should-i-get-mains-powered-or-lithium-ion-battery-lawn-mower) (scroll down the page one paragraph).\n\n2. Magazines and Local Papers\n\nThere have been other mentions of products in glossy magazines, local papers etc, though results were nothing like the perfect storm after The Times piece. \n\nBecause of the sales resulting from press endorsements, I now concentrate my energies on trying to get mentions in print, preferably national. In the US, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be equivalent to national coverage, but then I think your state and local papers have much more clout, and would be particularly effective if you have bricks-and-mortar stores, or if you can make a local Special Offer.\n\nBut as the circulations of these magazines and papers are almost all diminishing, it is hard to get attention. I study them carefully, and try to chose one editor or contributor who seems most likely to be on my green wavelength, then send them a sample, beautifully wrapped, with a nicely printed explanation of the product. \n\nI make the most I can of my USP ‚Äì what differentiates natural Lemongrass from other chemical-based products. I lay constant emphasis on \"safe-to-breathe, safe-to-consume, friend-to-the-environment\" etc. \n\nI think it‚Äôs really important to believe in your **unique** qualities. Otherwise, why do it?\n\n3. Advertising\n\nI‚Äôve tried advertising in magazines, or appearing in paid catalogues etc, always in a minor (I.e. non-extravagant) way, but I‚Äôve never had the impression I‚Äôve even recuperated the costs. I certainly don‚Äôt do Facebook ads.\n\nAlso, because my clientele is pretty well ‚Äògrown up‚Äô, (men and women, by the way), I don‚Äôt try internet Influencers or celebrities. [I tweet, though not regularly enough.](https://twitter.com/lemongrassltd) They say it‚Äôs good for your SEO, but who knows?\n\n4. Word of Mouth\n\nThe other thing I benefit from is word of mouth. \n\nFor instance, the surprise rush on Wasp Sprays from Disney: I never did find out how exactly they found me, the answer was a vague \"Oh, when we had a wasp problem,  someone mentioned you‚Ä¶\". So thank you, Ms/Mr Anonymous, if you are reading this!\n\nOne thing I attribute this to is taking great care with each order. I enclose copy of the order and usually write a personal note on it. This takes 30 seconds, and I feel is worth that little bit of trouble.\n\nJust now, I‚Äôm getting a lot of trade from Gastro Pubs and Micro-Breweries, for my ‚Äòedible‚Äô Fly Spray. Because most fly sprays are so harsh, and maybe even toxic, it used to be impossible to use a spray once the glasses had been put out, even if the fly problem continued. But now bar managers can use Lemongrass at any time of day, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if it splashes onto food or drink.\n\n### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?\n\nYou might not think it, but my Lemongrass stuff is quite seasonal and erratic. \n\nIn the winter, I still sell Fly Spray to pubs (Fruit Flies) ed all the year round) and Yoga Sprays to people into Mindfulness. But come spring, the Moth season will start again - clothes moths hatch from April onwards. In the summer, I sell loads of Midge Sprays to people going to Scotland, and Mozzie sprays for travelers aware of the problems with Deet. \n\nLast summer, I unexpectedly sold over ¬£600 worth of Wasp Spray to the Disney Corporation, who were shooting near London and had an attack of wasps on set.\n\nAs far as revenue, it is incredibly erratic. Insects hibernate, damn them!  \n\nWith national newspaper coverage (The Times) it can suddenly trigger ¬£5000 worth of orders. At a one day fair in London, I maybe make ¬£3-4000. \n\nBut there are slack periods, with just Yoga and Fresheners to tide me over. Around Easter there's a surge of demand for Anti-Moth products, as people store away their winter clothes, and see the first moths fluttering out of their closets.\n\nThen in May-June, aphids start ruining people's roses and tender crops ‚Äì I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll go for my new safe-to-breathe safe-to-eat Aphid spray.\n\n> Go out of your way for the customer: add something extra to the order. Let them know if there‚Äôs a delay.  Tie it with ribbons when you can!\n\nOverall, the annual figure is humble by contrast to some of the other businesses featured on Starter Story, but I'd say the average is ¬£1500-2000 per month, and rising.\n\n2017 was the first year I made any sort of profit ‚Äì not huge, but OK.\n\nOf course, I want to expand - I‚Äôd be so happy to have a full-time Marketing dude, and someone to take on all the business side of it. They‚Äôd need to share the same ethical viewpoint though.\n\nYou have probably gathered, I believe passionately in Lemongrass and my products, for safer households, better food, greener horticulture. I want to improve the environment, and in a small way make the world a safer, better place. But it would be great to bring in a sympathetic business partner, and concentrate on the amazing potential products we could develop. \n\nMore and more people are now into green issues, seeking for non-chemical solutions for the world, that I think this might be natch for Crowdfunding, and that way I‚Äôd find that a sympathetic way to expand.\n\n### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?\n\n* Belief (first in the product, secondly in yourself)\n\n* Be in it for the long haul. I don‚Äôt want to depress or put any one off, but it will take longer than you think.\n\n* Never waste anything. You‚Äôve bought the wrong bottles? Think of another use for them. One product doesn‚Äôt seem to sell? Give it away as a sample when you want to do something extra. \n\n* Go out of your way for the customer: add something extra to the order. Let them know if there‚Äôs a delay.  Tie it with ribbons when you can!\n\n* What would I do differently? Start sooner. \n\n* What would I tell a friend? Just start, right now.\n\n### What platform/tools do you use for your business?\n\nI used to use [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com), which is a great format and works beautifully, but as the pound sterling lost value, the charge per month became too expensive. \n\nI now have a [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) site, which has no monthly charge. My present website was built for me by [Byron Design](https://byrondesign.com.au), which I‚Äôm very happy with. But I realise ‚Äì and it still takes me by surprise‚Äì how constantly the website needs watching over. Things date, or cease to function, or react oddly, and who knows what customers you have lost in the meantime. I am rather too careless about that, and suddenly realise corrections are needed.\n\nAs far as finances, I have just started with [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/). It seems excellent, but like all of those programs, you have to remember to make the entries, and I find it so boring! I‚Äôm amazed at how much I have forgotten at the end of the day.\n\n### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?\n\n**Books:**\n\nAs I‚Äôve said elsewhere, I believe that if you can read, you can do anything. But  I confess, reading about business stuff did not come easy.\n\n**Finance:**\n\n\nAll accounts of Double-entry Bookkeeping have utterly defeated me, so I‚Äôm not a good example, but for Accounting, I‚Äôd recommend Anthony Rice‚Äôs Accounts Demystified as clear and understandable.\n\n**Startups:**\n\n \nThe Financial Times produces an annual Guide to Business Start Ups. Even if your copy is a couple of years out of date, it‚Äôs still very useful.\n\n\nAlso: The Lean Startup by Eric Ries.\n\n**Inspiration:**\n\nInspirational rather than helpful: Walter Isaacson‚Äôs biography of Steve Jobs ‚Äì I found all 600 pages absolutely compelling reading. I love it that Jobs hated the term branding because he felt that it should be about **informing** customers, not convincing them.\n\n\nAnita Roddick‚Äôs autobiography (she founded Body Shop, and was an early eco-warrior). This was useful because I needed to be told: do not fret about offices etc, just simply start at the kitchen table. \n\n**2. Film:**\n\nMy favourite film of all time is The Commitments, directed by Alan Parker. It‚Äôs about an Irish band getting together. It‚Äôs a great film for anyone starting up, funny, inspiring, and the music is great!\n\n### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?\n\nAdvice is rarely heeded, but may I dish out my few words?\n\n1. If you can read, you can do anything (except Double-Entry Accounting)\n\n2. Just do it\n\n3. Keep on doing it. You do have to be persistent. \n\n4. Good luck to young entrepreneurs, wherever you are!\n\n### Where can we go to learn more? \n\nCheck out the website at [lemongrasstrading.com](https://www.lemongrasstrading.com).",

This gives the queen lots of room to lay and reduces congestion because the nurse bees go up to tend to the open brood.

Face hair clothes phone.\n\nDont bring food or clothing you wipes your food hands with or napkins you used for food in your pockets or bags into where you will be sleeping. \n\nCheck everything always for a few seconds a least before you lean on it. Brush against it. Sit on it. Put it in your mouth or bag etc. \n\nIf you get stung don't scratch it. Get naked without rubbing and try witch hazel. \n\nPrevention is essential and learning the patterns where they will always show up will help you much in negating misery. \n\nand witch hazel helps a bit if you can be quick.

I then plan to move the hive a foot at a time to a location behind this tree about ten feet away (There is an 8‚Äô tall solid fence between the hive location and the adjacent neighbor‚Äôs house and no one living beyond the chain link, it‚Äôs just a road 30-40‚Äô away).\n\nTampa, Florida.

I don‚Äôt want them to get too hot in the swarm box but I want to give them time to move in before transferred ing them to a hive box. \n\n2. Food. Pollen and nectar availability does not seem to be a problem right now. Should I feed them anyway after transferring them to the hive box?\n\n3. Is there any way to increase the likelihood that they will permanently move in? Could I, say, reapply some lemongrass oil on or near the trap? Or cut up some lemongrass and leave it around this tree?\n\n4. Is moving the hive box a foot at a time an ok idea?\n\nThanks in advance for reading and for any advice. ",

Example day day 1 medicine, day 2 bleach bath, day 3 essential oils, day 4 essentials oils, day 5 sulphur powder with lotion, day 6 essential oils, day 7 benzyl benzoate OR wilkinson 12% pomat or The things that helped the most was the following: \n\nüîëIvermectin Cream 1% (prescribed by a doctor)\nüîëBenzyl Benzoate (Xabion -very hard to get OR from Maximpulse website)\nüîë Wilkinson 12 % Pomat (very hard to get- THE WORST SMELL EVERRR)\nüîë Bleach Bath (Only A Couple times then I stopped)\nüîë Took Wash Ups during treatment meaning for a few days a week I would not let water FROM SHOWER run down my body.  Literally this is soooo important I feel like water spreads this condition bad.  \nA wash up is basically you wash your body in sections with out water from the shower hitting your body, so underarms/ private areas/ arms in sections with different rags/disposable wipes with soap added ‚Ä¶ this is very extreme but I was desperate and noticed extreme improvement. \nüîëOil of Oregano/Tea Tree Oil Mixed (MAJOR MAJOR KEY) - never ever ever use this with any amount of water on your body burns soooo bad\nüîë Clove Oil (spot treatment) \nüîë Drying Clothes multiple times in a row and then keeping them in bags for weeks (not guaranteed to work but works majority of the time)\nüîëThrowing ALLLLLL of my clothes and sheets away (shopped at walmart clearance section for months) \nüîë Lice Shampoo that contains permethrin \nüîë Wear disposable Gloves when putting on treatments, when doing anything just wear disposable gloves to not cross contaminate\nüîë When you do take showers (I think showers and baths spread it tbh) USE FLIP FLOPS ON YOUR FEET (from Dollar Tree while its summer stock up if you are in the US) to decrease spread of condition and have everyone who uses the shower wear them too. \nüîë Use essential oils multiple times a day on essential oils days.  Literally the more you attack it the faster you will heal. \nüîë Any chair that you use should be wrapped with plastic ( if you are in the US the Dollar Tree has plastic table covers for parties that are $1.25 and are perfect to cover chairs every 2-3 days) \n\nüîë Sulfur soap when you are showering.  Sulfur soap is very effective ( I would cut up a single bar into pieces so I would not cross contaminate and multiple people in the house would be able to have their own piece of soap) \n\nI have had this condition THREE times in the last 6 years so when I tell you I know what works to get rid of it.  Trust me I do.  This time was the hardest because I have a toddler so his case was the most stubborn out of anyone in the house because he touches everything, runs everywhere, and has sensitive skin.\n\nWhat I tried that I am not sure if it helped or not: \n\nNeem oil (made me break out alot) \n\nLemongrass oil (helped the itching but idk if it cured me, it is helpful) \n\nAloe Vera Gel (soothes skin) \n\nPermethrin (used like 7 times üò≠ or more idk it would always come back for me, did work for other members of the household but made them break out in random rashes then they were healed ü§î )",

I'm just beginning my jorney and am still unsure of where to begin so I'd like to ask more experienced witches something.\n\n\nThe other day, I was walking down a path near my building and right on the path I found a playing card turned over. \nIt looked old and was right on my path so I felt drawn to it and picked it up. It was a Jack of spades, specifically from the game Belot or Belote.\n\nI took it home with me and, since I've been learning about the animist approach, tried to treat it as if it has a spirit.\nI am still sceptical about spirits in objects, but if any have them I would say it is old or very sentimental things, so I gave it a try.\n\nI talked to it about what I wanted to do with it. Said they're my first spirit and how I'd like them to let me know if they don't want to be here. (I just expressed all of it verbally)\n\nI also made an offering od cleaning the card up and keeping it safe. \nI gently cleaned it with destilled alcohol and dried it above a candle. It still smells, but the color is somewhat brighter.\nAfter it I put it on my shelf, near my tools ( I don't have an official altar yet) and added with it a swab with some lemongrass oil (I read it helps with communication) to make it smell better.\n\nI also looked up the meaning of the jack of spades. As far as I got it, it represents a cunning young man that I should be vary off for he might trick me. \nThere are other derivations of the meaning from that, but as far as I got it it just wants me to be vary of trickery and exploitation.\n\n\nI understand not everything is a sign or has a spirit necessarily, but I found the whole situation worth exploring and learning with.\n\nI'd like to know your thoughts, but also:\n- How else can I approach this? \n-Did I do something potentially harmful?\n-Should I not treat it as a spirit and not take it as a potential sign?\n-How would you interpret the whole situation?\n\nThank you everyone! I would love to know more folk/traditional-based perspectives, but all opinions are certainly great to learn from!",

        "body": "When I read with playing cards, I do so using a Belote/Piquet deck in the French tradition.\n\nThe Jack of Spades is the most negative card in the deck. Full stop. It represents serious problems and trouble. When it represents a person, it is someone who seeks to harm you or see you suffer simply for personal pleasure. \n\nThe interpretations of cunning and exploitation are correct, but again, in the context of wanting to do so for personal pleasure. In other words, this isn't someone who wants to trick you so that they can get ahead at work, for example. They simply want to see you fail.\n\nAll that said, I personally am doubtful that this would be a sign or have any sort of supernatural significance. Where I live, playing cards are pretty common and so it wouldn't be especially out of place to find one on the ground somewhere.\n\nIf you feel that there could be more to it, then I would suggest performing a divination for greater insight.\n\nIf you feel uneasy about the situation, then you might like to perform a simple cleansing.

Otherwise comb the powder through and style as normal. \n\nStay safe and patch test on your scalp first. If there are no signs of a reaction, you‚Äôre probably good to go and use it as intended.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Glossary**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Active charcoal:** This is a pure black powder that absorbs oil, pulls out toxins and unpleasant odors and deep cleans the hair. It also provides relief for dandruff and itchy scalp.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cornstarch:** This absorbs grease and oil, changing those flat roots to fresh and clean looking.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cocoa powder:** Use for brown hair. It smells great, adds vibrancy, covers greys and even boosts blood circulation which therefore stimulates hair growth. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnamon:** This is perfect for red heads. It stimulates the scalp and makes hair strong and healthy. It is antibacterial too so it prevents infections and can even be used to help lighten hair.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Baby powder:** This absorbs oils and leaves sweet smelling fresh locks. It‚Äôs gentle on the hair and doesn‚Äôt clog so makes styling easy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Rice flour:** This helps to protect your hair from the sun. It can also help relieve sunburn. It‚Äôs starchy texture makes it great for hair straightening.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Arrowroot:** This is the best option for blonde hair as it‚Äôs fine, light and has no odor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Baking soda:** This quickly cleans your roots and removes unwanted product build up. It helps to balance the PH of your scalp and provides effective relief of dry hair and itchy scalp.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Blended oatmeal:** This contains antioxidant and anti bacterial properties so it works perfectly between washes to combat dull looking hair. Also good if your scalp is a bit itchy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Coffee:** This helps with combating dandruff. The caffeine also stimulates the roots, making the hair stronger and deterring from hair loss. It provides a natural shine and makes the hair more manageable. Also great to hide any greys.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI found this great information over at https://www.livebeautyhealth.com/diy-dry-shampoo/",

    "body": "Yesterday I saw a dinner plate-sized swarm in my neighbors yard, about 50 feet away from my two hives, on the grass (it looks like they overloaded a branch and fell). I placed a bottom board, one deep and one medium with a lid about 10 feet away, with empty comb dotted with lemongrass oil inside. They didn't seem to want to move in, so after a while I located the queen and tried to capture her so I could place her in the hive. Unfortunately I wasn't good enough to catch her and she flew away, and I'm not sure if she returned. \n\nAfter a few hours, and much googling, I decided to take a frame with about 75% capped/25% open brood from my stronger hive to place in the swarm box, as it seems this would \"anchor them\". This was around 3pm. At dusk the majority of the swarm had clustered in the overhang of the top cover, and stayed that was overnight. \n\nThis morning they are the same -- clustered outside the box under the lid, except now there seems to be a handful of bees fighting by the entrance reducer on the swarm box, without much traffic in or out. This is taking place in MN, with the goldenrod flow just tapering off. I did a very detailed check of both my hives and am about 75% sure it wasn't my hives that swarmed -- I didn't see any swarm cells in either, the brood deeps aren't honeybound,  they have lots of space in the supers, and both have capped honey and pollen (I'm running with three deeps -- my strong hive has the top deep 100% capped honey, the other perhaps 60%). The only thing unusual was a surprising amount of capped drone cells in the second brood deep in my stronger hive - 3 full frames worth. I did not see a queen in that hive, I didn't check too close for her though.\n\nSorry for the essay but I wanted to give as much detail as I could. So, my questions are --\n\n1.) Is there anything else I can do to get this swarm to fully move in?\n\n2.) Is this swarm even worth saving, being so late in the season? There's still a flow but it's tapering, and this is the last of the season.\n\n3) Am I wrong in thinking this wasn't a swarm from my hives? There's 40 acres of forest and meadow behind my hives.\n\n4) Did I harm my hive by pulling a full frame of capped and uncapped brood to place in the swarm, with the brood-rearing time of year ending? \n\n5) If this swarm doesn't move in, can I take the frame of brood I placed in there and put in back in my hive?\n\nThanks for all your advice. I'm a first year beekeeper and I'm really trying to be a responsible one, both to the bees and to my neighbors. I can include pictures if that helps.",

The essential oils I have at home are peppermint oil, lavender oil, lemongrass oil and lemon eucalyptus oil. \n\nThe one I am using on my face mixed with a base oil is the lemon eucalyptus. I mix 2-3 drops with 10 ml of oil. I am not a huge fan of DIY so I make small amounts to make sure it doesn't spoil. Two drops of lavender oil mixed with my body moisturizer is the best and most effective mosquito repellent I've found. My skin is clear and I don't have any particular issues so I can't really say if they are doing something amazing for me or if I am simply enjoying the cozy fragrance. Peppermint oil had a really strong cooling effect on my face, I didn't end up liking it that much. Or the mix I made was too strong for me, it's not impossible. \n\nIs anyone else using essential oils, which ones and what benefits did you see? \n\nP.S. I know you should never ever apply essential oils straight to your face and you must always dilute them in a base oil/moisturizer. ",

People were tipping 30-50% pretty regularly - at least two three tables a night. I even got three 100% tips that month. the energy around these spells started to feel different to me and lately every time I do a spell for money at work I tend to do worse than usual. At this point I‚Äôm not even trying to do sigils - nothing feels like it‚Äôs flowing. Is there a way to kind of cleanse myself/ my craft of this?

The odd thing was that nmom began claiming that mites were coming up out of her skin, and she‚Äôd wipe them onto tissues. However‚Ä¶scabies mites are NOT visible to the human eye. I told her this, but she continued to insist the things really were mites. Brother 13M put some of these under a microscope at my request, and he said they did not look anything like the magnified picture of a scabies mite that I sent him.\n\nEventually nmom had an in-person appointment with a dermatologist. She has what looks like skin irritation of some kind to me, but the dermatologist says he does not think nmom has scabies after permethrin and ivermectin. Also, when nmom tried to show him the ‚Äúmites,‚Äù he looked at them with a magnifying glass thing and said that they were just fibers.\n\nHowever, nmom thinks they appears to be damaged mites and not fibers. She‚Äôs complaining to everyone about how the dermatologist didn‚Äôt believe her, and she continues to insist she‚Äôs infested in spite of everything. (She seems to feel persecuted or something by doctors, and she believes her google ‚Äúresearch‚Äù more than anything else.) There‚Äôs an actual psychotic disorder where you believe you‚Äôre infested by bugs when you‚Äôre really not, and there‚Äôs medication to treat that condition. Nmom would NEVER admit she had it though.\n\n**So, yeah. She‚Äôs actually insane now. Does anyone else have similar stories? I‚Äôd love to hear them so I feel less alone.**",

Example day day 1 medicine, day 2 bleach bath, day 3 essential oils, day 4 essentials oils, day 5 sulphur powder with lotion, day 6 essential oils, day 7 benzyl benzoate OR wilkinson 12% pomat or The things that helped the most was the following: \n\nüîëIvermectin Cream 1% (prescribed by a doctor)\nüîëBenzyl Benzoate (Xabion -very hard to get OR from Maximpulse website)\nüîë Wilkinson 12 % Pomat (very hard to get- THE WORST SMELL EVERRR)\nüîë Bleach Bath (Only A Couple times then I stopped)\nüîë Took Wash Ups during treatment meaning for a few days a week I would not let water FROM SHOWER run down my body.  Literally this is soooo important I feel like water spreads this condition bad.  \nA wash up is basically you wash your body in sections with out water from the shower hitting your body, so underarms/ private areas/ arms in sections with different rags/disposable wipes with soap added ‚Ä¶ this is very extreme but I was desperate and noticed extreme improvement. \nüîëOil of Oregano/Tea Tree Oil Mixed (MAJOR MAJOR KEY) - never ever ever use this with any amount of water on your body burns soooo bad\nüîë Clove Oil (spot treatment) \nüîë Drying Clothes multiple times in a row and then keeping them in bags for weeks (not guaranteed to work but works majority of the time)\nüîëThrowing ALLLLLL of my clothes and sheets away (shopped at walmart clearance section for months) \nüîë Lice Shampoo that contains permethrin \nüîë Wear disposable Gloves when putting on treatments, when doing anything just wear disposable gloves to not cross contaminate\nüîë When you do take showers (I think showers and baths spread it tbh) USE FLIP FLOPS ON YOUR FEET (from Dollar Tree while its summer stock up if you are in the US) to decrease spread of condition and have everyone who uses the shower wear them too. \nüîë Use essential oils multiple times a day on essential oils days.  Literally the more you attack it the faster you will heal. \nüîë Any chair that you use should be wrapped with plastic ( if you are in the US the Dollar Tree has plastic table covers for parties that are $1.25 and are perfect to cover chairs every 2-3 days) \n\nüîë Sulfur soap when you are showering.  Sulfur soap is very effective ( I would cut up a single bar into pieces so I would not cross contaminate and multiple people in the house would be able to have their own piece of soap) \n\nI have had this condition THREE times in the last 6 years so when I tell you I know what works to get rid of it.  Trust me I do.  This time was the hardest because I have a toddler so his case was the most stubborn out of anyone in the house because he touches everything, runs everywhere, and has sensitive skin.\n\nWhat I tried that I am not sure if it helped or not: \n\nNeem oil (made me break out alot) \n\nLemongrass oil (helped the itching but idk if it cured me, it is helpful) \n\nAloe Vera Gel (soothes skin) \n\nPermethrin (used like 7 times üò≠ or more idk it would always come back for me, did work for other members of the household but made them break out in random rashes then they were healed ü§î )",

    "body": "**Hypothyroidism**, also called **underactive thyroid** or **low thyroid**, is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goiter. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or congenital iodine deficiency syndrome.\n\nHypothyroidism Symptoms, Causes and Treatments\n\nThe thyroid is a small gland located on the base of your neck, sometimes described as butterfly-shaped. Meanwhile, at the base of the brain sits the pituitary gland, which secretes the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH makes the thyroid produce and release thyroxine, the main thyroid hormone.\n\nAlmost 5 percent of the U.S. population over the age of 12 has some form of hypothyroidism. Some estimates suggest up to 40 percent of the population suffers from at least some level of underactive thyroid. Women ‚Äî especially older women ‚Äî are the most susceptible group for developing hypothyroidism. People who are elderly or who have other existing autoimmune diseases ‚Äî like type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease, for example ‚Äî are also at a higher risk.\n\nWhat are some¬†of the most common symptoms of hypothyroidism? Changes to your metabolism, heart function, digestion, energy, appetite, sleep or mood ‚Ä¶ even the growth of your hair, skin and nails can all be caused by hypothyroidism.\n\nHowever, a hypothyroidism diagnosis is not a death sentence! There are many ways to treat hypothyroidism naturally through a hypothyroidism diet plan and other natural remedies. Find out how to start your journey below.\n\n### 9 Potential¬†Causes of Hypothyroidism\n\n### 1. Inflammatory disorders of the thyroid\n\nThe most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed nations is a condition called Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditis. This is an autoimmune endocrine disorder that occurs when the thyroid becomes inflamed. When someone has Hashimoto‚Äôs, their own body essentially begins to attack itself by producing antibodies that try to destroy the thyroid gland.\n\nWhy does this happen? The immune system mistakenly thinks that the thyroid cells are not a part of the body, so it tries to remove them before they can cause damage and illness. The problem is that this causes widespread inflammation, which can result in many different problems. According to¬†Dr. Datis Kharrazian, 90 percent of people with hypothyroidism¬†have Hashimoto‚Äôs that¬†inflames the thyroid gland over time, but this isn‚Äôt the only cause of hypothyroidism.\n\n### 2. Poor diet (especially one lacking in iodine and selenium)\n\nA diet low in nutrient-rich foods, especially in iodine and selenium¬†(which are trace minerals crucial for thyroid function), increases the risk for hypothyroid disorders. The thyroid gland needs both selenium and iodine to produce adequate levels of thyroid hormones. These nutrients also play other protective roles in the body. For example: severe selenium deficiency increases the incidence of thyroiditis because it stops activity of a very powerful antioxidant known as glutathione, which normally controls inflammation and fights oxidative stress. Getting on track with a hypothyroidism diet ensures that you get the appropriate amounts of selenium and iodine in your diet.\n\n### 3. Hormone imbalances\n\nIn some rare cases, because the pituitary gland makes a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) ‚Äî which controls the levels of hormones being pumped out of the thyroid ‚Äî a problem with the pituitary gland can cause changes to thyroid function.\n\n### 4. Gut inflammation (Leaky Gut Syndrome)\n\nAn unhealthy gut environment can contribute to nutrient deficiencies and raise autoimmune activity in the body. Food sensitivities or allergies, including those to gluten and dairy, can trigger gut inflammation. Other causes of a damaged gut are high stress levels, toxin overload from diet and the environment and bacterial imbalances. When leaky gut occurs, small particles that are normally trapped inside the gut start to leak out into the bloodstream through tiny openings in the gut lining, which creates an autoimmune cascade and a series of negative symptoms.\n\n### 5. Genetics\n\nAlthough it‚Äôs not very common, newborns are sometimes born with a dysfunction of the thyroid gland, a genetic condition called congenital hypothyroidism. Some evidence shows that people are more likely to develop hypothyroidism if they have a close family member with an autoimmune disease. But according to the National Institute of Health (NIH), the likelihood of congenital hypothyroidism is very low and only about 1 out of every 4,000 newborns is born with a thyroid disorder.\n\n### 6. Pregnancy\n\nDuring or following¬†pregnancy, although it‚Äôs not exactly known why, some women begin to produce very high levels of thyroid hormones, followed by a very rapid decline. This condition is known as postpartum thyroiditis. The symptoms often disappear within 12‚Äì18 months but can also lead to permanent hypothyroidism.\n\n### 7. Interactions of certain medications\n\nSpecific medications seem to lead frequently to the development of underactive thyroid. The most common of these include drugs to treat¬†cancer, heart problems and certain psychiatric conditions.\n\n### 8. High levels of emotional stress\n\nStress impacts hormones and is known to worsen inflammation. Stress can raise levels of cortisol and adrenaline, which disturbs neurotransmitter function and worsens symptoms of thyroid disease. These include low energy levels, poor mood, low concentration, disturbed appetite and weight gain and the inability to get restful sleep.\n\n### 9. Inactivity and lack of exercise\n\nExercise and a healthy diet are important for controlling chronic stress and managing hormone-related neurological function. Research shows that people who regularly exercise usually get better sleep, deal with stress better and more often maintain a healthier weight, all of which reduce some of the biggest risk factors and symptoms associated with hypothyroidism.\n\n### Hypothyroidism Symptoms\n\nThe thyroid is considered a ‚Äúmaster gland.‚Äù In addition to producing crucial hormones, it helps control the process of turning nutrients from food into usable energy on which the body runs. Because the thyroid plays such a major part in your metabolism, dysfunction can affect almost every part of the body, including your energy levels and ability to burn calories.\n\nKey hormones produced by the thyroid also help the liver break down cholesterol that¬†circulates through the bloodstream. The thyroid can also stimulate enzymes that are needed to control triglyceride fat levels; this is why changes in thyroid function cause lead to heart problems.\n\nOther noticeable effects of hypothyroidism include moodiness and a sluggish metabolism.¬†Essentially, when your thyroid is underactive, your metabolism will slow down, which might mean you always feel tired or struggle to keep off weight.\n\nYour mood is especially susceptible to changes in hormone levels, so some people with hypothyroidism deal with depression, anxiety, trouble getting good sleep and low immunity.¬†The thyroid gland helps regulate chemical messengers called neurotransmitters, which control your emotions and nerve signaling. This is the reason an out-of-balance thyroid can mean drastic emotional changes at times.\n\nSome of the most common warning signs of hypothyroidism include:\n\n* Fatigue\n* Depression and anxiety\n* Weight gain\n* Infertility\n* Goiter¬†(nodules at the base of the neck, sometimes accompanied by tightness in the throat, coughing or swelling)\n* Feeling cold\n* Constipation\n* Muscle aches and tenderness\n* Kidney problems\n* Stiffness and swelling in the joints\n* Hair loss\n* Rough, cracked skin\n* Trouble breathing\n* Changes in the menstrual cycle\n* More frequent cold or¬†flu¬†due to low immune function\n\nTo find out if you have hypothyroidism, your doctor¬†will run blood tests to check for levels of the hormones known as T4 (thyroxine) and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Hypothyroidism is diagnosed in your thyroid test when TSH is high. Sometimes, TSH can be high, but the thyroid is still producing enough hormones. This condition is referred to as subclinical (or mild) hypothyroidism.\n\nMild hypothyroidism is usually the early stage. It can progress to hypothyroidism if a¬†hypothyroidism¬†diet isn‚Äôt adopted and lifestyle changes aren‚Äôt made. When the condition isn‚Äôt corrected, more severe autoimmune reactions can occur ‚Äî this¬†can cause worsened problems like impaired brain function, infertility, unhealthy pregnancy, obesity, heart complications and joint pain.\n\nAnother symptom to be aware of is¬†thyroid nodules, a buildup of cells within the thyroid, creating an abnormal lump. Most thyroid nodules aren‚Äôt dangerous. But some of them become cancerous over time. If your physician suspects you have thyroid nodules, he or she should have them evaluated to check for cancer cells.\n\nFor patients with thyroid cancers, a common conventional treatment method is known as radioiodine, or radioactive iodine. Because the thyroid absorbs most of your body‚Äôs iron content, this concentrated radiation is supposed to successfully kill most of the diseased thyroid cells without damaging cells throughout the rest of the body.\n\n### Complications\n\nIn some cases, people with an extremely underactive thyroid may fall into what is known as a myxedema coma, characterized by declining mental status, hypothermia and the slowing of many internal organs. If you or someone you know has severe thyroid problems and begins to show major lethargy or stupor, seek emergency medical attention at once.\n\nMyxedema comas are rare and occur most often in the elderly and women, especially in the winter months. Generally, it is the result of undiagnosed and/or untreated hypothyroidism and can be fatal if left untreated.\n\nHypothyroidism is very prevalent in kidney disease patients, in turns out. In a¬†*Current Opinion in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Obesity* study, evidence suggested that hypothyroidism was a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression and even higher death risk in kidney disease.\n\n### Natural Hypothyroidism Remedies\n\n### Hypothyroidism Diet\n\nWhat foods are good for an underactive thyroid? Here are the top foods for a¬†hypothyroidism diet to start the healing process:\n\n* Wild-caught fish: It provides the¬†omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, essential for hormone balance and thyroid function.\n* Coconut oil:¬†This provides medium-chain fatty acids in the form of caprylic acid, lauric acid and capric acid, which support a healthy metabolism, increase energy and fight fatigue.\n* Seaweed:¬†Good seaweeds are some of the best natural sources of iodine¬†and help prevent deficiencies that disturb thyroid function.\n* Probiotic-rich foods:¬†These include kefir (a fermented dairy product), organic goat‚Äôs milk yogurt, kimchi, kombucha, natto, sauerkraut and other fermented veggies.\n* Sprouted seeds:¬†Flax, hemp and chia seeds provide ALA, a type of omega-3 fat that‚Äôs critical for proper hormonal balance and thyroid function.\n* Clean water:¬†Water helps with hydration and digestive function while preventing fatigue and moodiness. For prevention of constipation, low energy and sugar cravings, drink at least eight ounces every two hours.\n* High fiber foods:¬†People with hypothyroidism may have digestive difficulties, so¬†aim for 30‚Äì40 grams of fiber daily. Not only does a high-fiber diet¬†help with digestive health, it also improves heart health, balances blood sugar levels and supports a healthy weight by making you feel fuller.\n* Bone broth:¬†Beef and chicken stock contain the amino acids L-proline and L-glycine, which can help repair the digestive lining and¬†improve hypothyroidism.\n* Fruits and vegetables:¬†These are high in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants¬†that are necessary for combating free-radical damage and lowering inflammation. They are nutrient-dense and should make up a large portion of a healthy diet since they support digestive health, brain function, heart health, hormone balance and a healthy weight.\n\nThese are foods that should¬†*not* appear in your¬†hypothyroidism diet:\n\n* Goitrogen foods:¬†People with hypothyroidism may want to stay away from eating large amounts of raw Brassica vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, soy and Brussels sprouts. These vegetables might impact thyroid function because they contain goitrogens, molecules which impair thyroid perioxidase.\n* Tap water:¬†Most tap water contains fluorine (an endocrine disruptor) and chlorine that¬†inhibit iodine absorption.\n* Gluten:¬†Many people with thyroid issues are also sensitive to gluten or have celiac disease, an autoimmune disease that results in an allergy to gluten. Gluten is found in all wheat, rye and barley products. Carefully check ingredient labels to avoid hidden gluten that is lurking in many packaged foods.\n* Conventional dairy:¬†Like gluten, dairy can be especially problematic for the thyroid, triggering reactions that raise inflammatory responses.¬†Avoid conventional cow‚Äôs milk dairy products that are not organic and have been pasteurized.¬†Consumption of organic, raw goat‚Äôs milk or organic A2 cow‚Äôs milk is a better choice.\n* Sugar:¬†Sugar can disrupt the hormone balance necessary for metabolism. People with thyroid issues have a difficult time losing weight. Because the thyroid is a key gland for hormonal balance and metabolism, it‚Äôs best to avoid sugar as it can contribute to hormonal disturbances, fatigue, mood changes, worsened¬†depression and weight gain.\n* Refined flour products:¬†Any food made with refined carbohydrates, like enriched wheat flour, for example, negatively impacts hormone levels and can contribute to weight gain.\n\n### Ashwagandha (500 milligrams¬†daily)\n\nAshwagandha¬†is an adaptogen herb that helps the body respond to stress, keeping hormone levels better in balance. Adaptogens helps lower cortisol and balance T4 levels. In fact, in clinical trials, supplementing with ashwagandha for eight weeks essentially worked as thyroxine treatment, helping hypothyroidism patients significantly increase thyroxine hormone levels and thus reduce the severity of the disorder. Also, try other adaptogen herbs like rhodiola, licorice root, ginseng and holy basil, which have similar benefits.\n\n### Iodine (150‚Äì300 micrograms¬†daily)\n\nStudies show that even small amounts of supplementary iodine (250 micrograms) cause slight but significant changes in thyroid hormone function in predisposed individuals. A diet rich in whole foods that contain¬†iodine ‚Äî including fish, sea vegetables, eggs, raw dairy and seaweed ‚Äî can help prevent deficiency.\n\nIodine supplements should not be taken with Hashimoto‚Äôs disease because getting too much iodine over the longterm increases the risk of developing an overactive thyroid. While it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get too much from eating a variety of healthy foods alone, sometimes people taking supplements or eating very high amounts of dried algae and seaweed can exceed the recommended upper limit of 500 milligrams per day.\n\n### Selenium (200¬†micrograms daily)\n\nThe thyroid is the organ with the highest selenium content in the whole body.¬†Selenium¬†is necessary for the production of the T3 thyroid hormone and can reduce autoimmune affects. In patients with Hashimoto‚Äôs disease and in pregnant women with thyroid disturbances, selenium supplementation decreases anti-thyroid antibody levels and improves the structure of the thyroid gland.\n\nBecause it helps balance hormone levels, selenium can lower the risk for experiencing thyroid disorder during pregnancy (postpartum thyroiditis) and afterward. Other studies have shown that when selenium deficiency is resolved through supplementation, patients experience on average 40 percent reduction in thyroid antibodies compared to a 10 percent increase when given a placebo.\n\n### L-tyrosine (500 milligrams¬†twice daily)\n\nAn amino acid used in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, thyroxin (T4) is naturally produced from the iodination of tyrosine, a nonessential amino acid obtained both from protein-containing dietary sources and through the body making some itself.\n\nSupplementing with L-tyrosine has been shown to improve sleep deprivation and can help combat fatigue and a poor mood by improving alertness and neurotransmitter function. One reason L-tyrosine is beneficial in healing thyroid symptoms is because it plays a role in the production of melatonin, dopamine and/or norepinephrine, which are our natural ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù hormones.\n\n### Fish oil (1,000 milligrams¬†daily)\n\nEssential fatty acids found in fish oil are critical for brain and thyroid function. DHA and EPA omega-3s found in fish oil are associated with a lower risk for thyroid symptoms, including¬†anxiety, depression, high cholesterol, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, diabetes, a weakened immune system and heightened autoimmune disease. Omega-3 fish oil supplements can also help balance levels of omega-6s in the diet, which is important for ongoing health.\n\n### Vitamin B-Complex (one B-complex capsule daily)\n\nVitamin B12 and thiamine are important for neurologic function and hormonal balance. Research shows that supplementing with thiamine can help combat symptoms of autoimmune disease, including chronic fatigue. In one clinical study, when patients with Hashimoto‚Äôs were given 600 milligrams per day of thiamine, the majority experienced complete regression of fatigue within a few hours or days.\n\nVitamin B12 is another important nutrient for fighting fatigue because it¬†benefits the central nervous system in many important ways: maintaining the health of nerve cells (including neurotransmitters); protecting the covering of nerves called the cell‚Äôs myelin sheath: and turning nutrients from food into usable energy for the brain and body.\n\n### Probiotic Supplement (50 billion CFU per serving)\n\nProbiotics can help heal the gut and aid in nutrient absorption while reducing inflammation. Other benefits of a high-quality probiotic include helping to maintain a stronger immune system; increasing energy from production of vitamin B12; reducing bacterial or viral growth in the gut such as¬†candida; improving skin health and helping with appetite control and weight loss.\n\n### Essential Oils\n\nTo improve thyroid function and help treat symptoms of autoimmune disease, try some of these essential oil protocols on top of your hypothyroidism diet:\n\n* Combine three drops of¬†frankincense¬†oil with five parts lemongrass oil and five parts clove oil. Rub these directly on the thyroid, which is located at the front lower part of your neck. You can also try putting two drops of frankincense oil on the roof of your mouth twice¬†daily.\n* Similarly, try rubbing two to four drops of lemongrass oil and myrrh directly on the thyroid area, along with the reflexology points on the feet (the big toes) and on the wrists multiple times per day.\n* To combat muscle or joint pain, try a soothing bath using¬†geranium, clove, myrrh and¬†lemongrass oils.\n* To fight fatigue, try a combination of peppermint and citrus oils, such as lemon and grapefruit.\n* To improve your mood and reduce anxiety or irritability, use chamomile, frankincense and lavender oil, either diffused in your home or added to a bath.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n* Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is underactive and doesn‚Äôt properly make or release thyroid hormones.\n* There is no cure for a hypothyroidism diagnosis, but there may be ways to naturally increase thyroid hormone production through dietary means.\n* When your thyroid is underactive, your metabolism will slow down, which might mean you always feel tired or struggle to keep off weight.\n* The hypothyroidism diet eliminates foods that can cause inflammation and immune reactions and instead focuses on foods that help heal the GI tract, balance hormones and reduce inflammation.\n\nHypothyroidism Effects on Pregnancy\n\n### Facts about hypothyroidism and pregnancy\n\nHypothyroidism is a condition marked by an underactive thyroid gland and may occur during pregnancy. Unfortunately, many symptoms of hypothyroidism are masked by symptoms of pregnancy, such as fatigue, weight gain, and abnormal menstruation and, as a result, the disease¬†may be¬†left undetected and untreated. In addition, the risk for developing hypothyroidism increases with age, which is significant because more and more women are delaying pregnancy until they are older.\n\n### What are the symptoms of hypothyroidism?\n\nHypothyroidism is a common condition, which can go undetected if symptoms are mild. Hypothyroidism means the thyroid is underactive, producing insufficient amounts of thyroid hormones. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are usually very subtle and gradual and may be mistaken for symptoms of depression. The following are the most common symptoms of hypothyroidism. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:\n\n* Dull facial expressions\n* Fatigue\n* Cold intolerance\n* Hoarse voice\n* Slow speech\n* Droopy eyelids\n* Puffy and swollen face\n* Weight gain\n* Constipation\n* Sparse, coarse, and dry hair\n* Coarse, dry, and thickened skin\n* Carpal tunnel syndrome (hand tingling or pain)\n* Slow pulse\n* Muscle cramps\n* Sides of eyebrows thin or fall out\n* Confusion\n* Increased or irregular menstrual flow in women\n\nThe symptoms of hypothyroidism may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your¬†doctor for a diagnosis.\n\n### How does hypothyroidism affect the fetus?\n\nDuring the first few months of pregnancy, the fetus relies on the mother for thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones play an essential part in normal brain development and growth of the fetus. Deprivation of the maternal thyroid hormones due to hypothyroidism can have devastating effects on the fetus.\n\n### How is the thyroid function screened?\n\nScreening for hypothyroidism involves a blood test that measures thyroid hormone (thyroxine, or T4) and serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels. Hypothyroidism is often suspected when TSH levels are above normal and T4 levels are below normal. Always consult your¬†doctor for a diagnosis.\n\n### Who should undergo thyroid function screening?\n\nThere is some¬†debate over whether¬†pregnant women¬†should be routinely screened for thyroid disease. Some experts recommend testing¬†only¬†if there is clinical suspicion of abnormal thyroid function and¬†do¬†not recommend thyroid testing as a routine part of prenatal care. Others feel that all women should be screened¬†for thyroid abnormalities¬†within the first¬†nine weeks of pregnancy.¬†The levels of thyroid hormone vary throughout the course of a pregnancy and need to be checked routinely if a person is on thyroid hormone supplementation. Women should¬†talk with their¬†doctor about their individual needs.\n\n### How is hypothyroidism treated during pregnancy?\n\nOnce hypothyroidism is diagnosed, thyroid hormone replacement therapy may be used to treat the mother. Dosage of thyroid hormone replacement therapy is based on the individual‚Äôs levels of thyroid hormones. The treatment is safe and essential to both mother and fetus. When the fetus is born, routine newborn screening includes a test of thyroid hormone levels.\n\nSource: [http://www.hiwamag.com/health/hypothyroidism/](http://www.hiwamag.com/health/hypothyroidism/)",

    "body": "Welcome to our ZetaClear review. Toenail fungus can be a persistent and troubling issue, leading to **yellow nails**, thickened texture, and even **nail discoloration**. This common problem affects the appearance of your nails as well as impacting your confidence and comfort.\n\n**ZetaClear** aims to address these concerns with its dual-action formula, combining a **topical solution** and a **homeopathic remedy** to target **fungal infections** effectively. But does it live up to its promises? Let's explore this product in detail.\n\n[See: \\\\\"Where to Buy\\\\\" below ...](https://i.redd.it/fsjzqqjck6id1.gif)\n\n# Product Overview\n\n**Product Name**: ZetaClear  \n**Product Category**: Toenail Fungus Treatment  \n**Overall Verdict**: 4.6/5\n\n**ZetaClear** is a well-known treatment for tackling toenail and fingernail fungus.

Alongside this, the product features natural oils like tea tree and clove oil, which are reputed for their **antifungal and antibacterial properties**.\n\n# ZetaClear Ingredients\n\nThe effectiveness of **ZetaClear** lies in its powerful blend of ingredients. The **topical solution** contains **undecylenic acid**, a proven **fungicidal agent** known for its ability to combat **fungal infections**.\n\nThe formula also includes essential oils like **tea tree oil**, **lemongrass oil**, and **clove oil**, which have been shown to help in reducing **nail discoloration** and promoting healthier nails.

After a few weeks of consistent application, I definitely noticed a significant reduction in **nail discoloration** and an overall improvement in the health of my nails.\n\nI remember the product being easy to use, and the lack of any strong odor was a bonus. The only drawback was the time it took to see results‚Äîit wasn't immediate, but over time there was no doubt that my nail health improved.\n\n# Star Ratings\n\n* **Effectiveness**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê The combination of undecylenic acid and natural oils effectively combats **fungal infections**.\n* **Ease of Use**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê The brush applicator makes application straightforward, though it requires consistent use.\n* **Value for Money**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê While not the cheapest option, the quality and effectiveness justify the price.\n* **Safety**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Made with natural ingredients and FDA-approved components, it's a safe choice.\n* **Customer Support**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Generally good, but the guarantee only covers unopened bottles, which can be a limitation.\n\nOverall Rating: **4.6/5**\n\n# Pros and Cons\n\n# Pros\n\n* **Effective against nail fungus**, visibly reducing **yellow nails** and **keratin debris**.\n* Contains **natural ingredients**, minimizing side effects.\n* **Easy-to-use brush applicator** for precise application.\n* 90-day money-back guarantee.\n\n# Cons\n\n* **Higher price point** compared to some alternatives.\n* The 90-day guarantee applies only to unopened bottles.\n* Requires consistent and patient use for optimal results.\n\n# Pricing Options\n\n**ZetaClear** offers several purchasing options:\n\n* **Single Bottle**: $47.95\n* **Three Bottles (Buy 2, Get 1 Free)**: $99.95\n* **Six Bottles (Buy 3, Get 3 Free)**: $149.95\n\nAlthough **ZetaClear** is priced higher than some competitors, the bulk purchase options offer better value with the 6 bottle deal working out at **$24.99 per bottle**. The quality and effectiveness of the product make it a worthwhile investment for those dealing with persistent **fungal infections**.\n\n# Where To Buy ZetaClear\n\nTo ensure you receive the authentic **ZetaClear** product and to benefit from the 90-day money-back guarantee, it's recommended to [purchase from the official website](https://theworldhealth.org/zetaclear-official.html). This safeguards against counterfeit products and ensures you have access to genuine customer support and any promotional discounts.\n\n# FAQ\n\n**1.

It is made with natural and organic ingredients. I have been using this for more than five months now and actually enjoy this enough to have backup ready already. I predict about 1-2 more months before I run out, which means this bottle can last for about 7-8 months, which is really pretty amazing!

I don't get anything if you use the code but you get a discount. ^ ^ Orgavalley is a relatively new name in the game of korean skincare. It focuses on natural ingredients and traditional fermentation with the modern nano-technology. Orgavalley is free from chemicals and focuses on minimal ingredients in it's products. At the price point of $34, it puts the cleanser with the higher end brands. Ingredients are only water, olive oil, Rosemary leaf water, Peppermint leaf water, Aloe ferox leaf extract, lavender leaf extract, glycerin, potassium hydroxide, Lavender oil, lemongrass oil.\n\nThe cleanser is quite high pH, sadly. It can't remove all makeup either, so it's actually quite mild. Almost a month into using this, my skin healed really well. The red, inflamed parts of my skin have gotten better, no more new pimples, and my skin is just slowly healing from the many breakouts. Ahh. Thank goodness. I've been struggling with the painful skin irritation for a few weeks prior to introducing this product and this really helped.\n\n[**Tia'm My Signature C Source Serum**](http://malaysianbeautyhaul.blogspot.my/2017/07/vitamin-c-review-tiam-my-signature-c.html)\n\nWon from instagram contest! :D [This product](http://bbcosmetic.com/tiam-ost-my-signature-c-source-serum-30ml/) was previously O.S.T. C20. Nothing has changed other than that. The only thing that's changed is the name. The product and ingredients, production line and I'm assuming even the people responsible for making these are the same. Tia'm kindly informed me that the reason for the name change is because people (me included) frequently mistake O.S.T. C20 for By Wishtrend, which are actually completely different.  In addition, there's an issue of trademark rights about C20 in the US, so the name change was necessary in order to extend the product line. I'm really pleased Tia'm is transparent about that. ^ ^ I purchased their [C21.5](http://malaysianbeautyhaul.blogspot.my/2016/09/review-ost-c20-pure-vitamin-c215.html) before and have purchased a few C20, but the Tia'm bottle was won during one of their giveaways.",

I got a phone call on dark past night that a friend had caught two swarms but only had one hive, would I like the second? \n\nOne hour later I had borrowed a super, poured in some sleepy looking bees, and I have a new hive! I unblocked the entrance this morning and got to watch then do an orientation flight. Half an hour later and I'm pretty sure I saw them coming back again which made me pretty happy. \n\nAnyway, I'm giddy, wanted to share. Oh, I'm in Australia too, so this is the beginning of spring for me. I've been told I could be spinning honey by Christmas!\n\nEdit 1: crisis. They left. My wife noticed a cloud of bees in the backyard which turned into a swarm on a palm tree leaf. I got a ladder, chopped the leaf down and tried to shake the swarm back into the hive but failed dismally. 8 feet of palm tree leaf is hard to control, and half the swarm flew off. I put what I could into the hive, added a frame of honey from my first hive and a few drops of lemongrass oil and put the lid on. \n\nNow there is a sizeable cloud of bees in the back yard, but there are lots around the hive itself. I have no idea what they are going to do now. Fingers crossed. \n\nEdit 2: they be gone. Not totally surprised, but I'm disappointed. ",

Some people hate the smell, my dogs seem to always love it and if I spray neem oil on my plants outside, the dogs want to roll in them.\n\nOn a side note, make sure your dog is also on a heartworm preventative.  I use sentinel flavor tabs.\n\nOh also thought to mention you can give your dogs some apple cider vinegar.  Some actually really like it and it can help with other skin issues.  Might change their odor a little, but I think it just takes on a more herbal scent.",

It was really inconvenient having them where they were, they were taking the whole back yard as their flight path. This morning, all the foragers have gone straight back to the old location. After a bit of reading, I've stuffed twigs in the entrances of the hives to encourage an orientation flight. I've also put lemongrass oil at the weaker hive's entrance to encourage lost bees back there. There are still heaps of foragers around the old site through, they are starting to cluster on the fence. Maybe I can catch them when they settle down and take them around to the new location? Maybe they will find their way back over the next few days? Luckily, the neighbours who share that fence are a long way below me (there is a retaining wall) the bees shouldn't bother them too much. Rookie mistake.\n\nUpdate: I put twigs in the hive entrance a few hours after sunset to make any late emergers orient to the new location and it seems to have worked. The lost bees were there all day, but now the sun has set, they have settled into a fist sized cluster on a steel frame I set in the old location. There can be more than a few hundred bees there. If that's all I've lost, this is a fairly minor disaster. The bees at the entrance to the hives have been fanning Nasenov glands like crazy all day, some of them probably found their way home, and I did manage to get a maybe a hundred bees back during the day when they had settled on that same steel frame. Pretty sure they will be OK in their new spot. I keep doing dumb things, but my girls just take it onto their stride and continue to survive and thrive.",

If they are knock the rest into your bucket device again and dump them in the box too. Let it sit some more. The bees are either going to figure out the queen is in the box and join her or she isn't and leave most likely back to the branch. Its already late in the day so let it sit over night if you can. If they are still there tomorrow then she is in the box. \n\nHowever long you let it sit when you finally take it home put a frame of eggs/larva in it from another hive just in case. If you didnt get her the will start raising a new one. If you did this gives them incentive to stay.\n\nYou can always try and dig through the box, find her and cage, but you probably don't have a cage, aren't comfortable caging her, and finding a slimmed down queen in a just caught swarm is often hard since she isn't on frames laying. Skills to learn for next time.\n\nWhen you go to catch a swarm take a sheet and put it down before the box, that helps keep the bees out of the grass and let them march into the hive easier.",

    "body": "So my fianc√© made a post here earlier today in case this story sounds familiar. Our bees overwintered QUITE well, so we did a split a few weeks ago, moving our old queen to the new split. Things are looking good, she paused laying for a bit but got going again. Our original hive had multiple queen cells after a bit, and today they swarmed (was wandering if we should've done two splits...they seemed very strong even after the first one) and one queen cell is open. I'm assuming that virgin queen hatched, and a handful of our bees took off with her. Still tons of activity in front of the original hive (that swarmed) so we took a peek to see if there was any chance it was a \"false swarm\" (idk how common this is but I've seen people say it can happen) but we didn't see any emerged queen. There is however still a fully capped queen cell in the top brood box (open queen cell is in the bottom brood box.) There are still TONS of bees, and lots of nectar/capped honey. Do you think the still capped queen cell is still viable? I assumed it would look visibly damaged from the other queen, but looks normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it is viable, should we leave it in that hive to emerge and HOPEFULLY she'll just go on a mating flight and come back to be the queen of that original hive? Or  should we make a split with it, hoping its viable, and throw a frame of eggs in from out split we made so they can try for another queen? I swear I tried to do research for this, but it seems like there are lots of possibilities for behavior during swarm season. Last year we did well with them, got them through winter, and I really want to nail down how to manage swarm season with a strong hive, apparently 1 split wasn't enough!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, swarm disappeared from the pine branch...hoisted a bucket up with frames, comb, and a dab of lemongrass oil. Saw 2-3 bees checking it out, but we don't know if they're from the swarm or one of our other hives.  Unfortunately seems like they got away from us :(\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vnrp1qslg6oc1.jpg?width=1720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f7a3b05c5f75b9b499117fc98fcd255ddafc597",

I was careful to go easy on the smoker so flames don‚Äôt go into the walls. I am aware the risk is extreme doing this method. I found just holding it there without pumping it let‚Äôs steady smoke in. I also put a few drops of peppermint oil into the smoker to repel them further. It smelled like candy canes. Many of the bees left the wall as expected. But most just buzzed around and tried to go upwards, as expected. Some actually did go in. But they don‚Äôt escape the trap often and there isn‚Äôt much of a communication to get the others bees to follow. My plan was to basically brush them down into the funnel whenever enough of the gathered outside the wall. \n\nAfter a few hours, there were a lot of bees in there. I regret making the mesh enclosure above the trap. I probably should have just had the funnel and no other way in/out. They were really confused trying to get out and go upwards. Bees from the outside gathered on the mesh and appeared to be trying to help, perhaps by chewing the mesh. I cut a tiny hole there so they could crawl in. So that is a secret passage they can travel through, but only a couple bees used it. (I pushed more than a few in)\n\nSo now, I am going to wait a few days. My question to you all is this: do you think the bees in the trap should have an easier way out, so they can forage?  I worry that would that just allow them to return to the all. Can they survive on the nectar in the trap for a week?\n\nAnd the person living there will observe which direction bees tend to be moving, from the wall to the trap, or from the trap to the wall.",

This year, I used a 7 gallon chicken feeder with river rocks in the tray for them to stand on.  The bees never really took interest.  Someone later told me they don't like their water source close to the hives, and I had it within 10 feet of them, so that might be part of the problem.  \n\nProblems I had:\nbees weren't interested in the water source\nalgae buildup in tray/reservoir.\n\nI've heard bleach can take care of both problems, but so far all I've found is anecdotal recommendations with \"a few glugs of bleach\".  I'd rather not put something potentially toxic to the bees in the water without following someone's experienced advice on exactly how much (w/w, w/v, or v/v) to use.  I've also heard lemongrass oil can help \"scent\" the water for them to be attracted to it, and if you've used that I'd love to hear how much you've used.  I'd like to stick to the chicken feeder if I can for simplicity's sake, it was a really nice setup on my end, I just need to convince the bees that it's good for them too :P.",

These small, brown gnats have been loving my bedroom the past month or two, and I am getting bitten to shreds. I am so frustrated. I've used the sticky ribbon traps, which they just ignore, even though I put them I. The highest traffic areas. Again, they don't care about it the vinegar traps. I've turned the AC way down and the fan way up. Ive used lemongrass oil everywhere. We have pest services done about every 3 months. \n\nI live in the southeast. My house is over 100 years old, but has never really had any pest/infestation problems aside from the occasional water bug or spider. There are no plants in the house. I do not eat in my bedroom, nor is there any standing water. The windows in my bedroom do have gaps of about an inch. It's not directly open to the outside, it's more like an opening to the gap between the two panes, and the outer pane is also wedged open, but it is technically open to the outside. I've brought that up to my landlord, to see if they'd caulk it or something, but they didn't do anything about it. \n\nI am frustrated because I am getting bitten all the time. They're like mosquito bites, and they're not only itchy, but painful. I'm frustrated because none of the remedies or solutions I see online are working. And it's honestly causing my anxiety to skyrocket. As an introvert, my room is my safe place to let my guard down, but I don't feel like I can relax anymore. I'm on edge. I hope people read this. What do I do? \n\nEdit: I also wanted to add that I haven't used the traps that you plug into the wall because my room only has 2 outlets, both of which are behind furniture (my dresser and my bed) and I really don't want anything attracting them towards those areas. \n\nI have a history of OCD that I believe stems from a serious roach infestation I had in my very first apartment. I do not believe this is self-imposed or a mental thing, though, because my two roommates are experiencing the same problems with the gnats in their rooms. ",

So on last week's friday I took Moxi, kids were treated with permethrin and my husband with sulfur (We couldn't find a lot of info on Moxi drug interactions so we skipped that for my husband as he's on epilepsy meds that come with a ton of side effects as is) I've been using aloe vera with lemongrass oil on my skin, my husband has been using 10% sulfur, we're using aloe vera on the kids inbetween the permethrin treatments. We're washing and drying all clothes and bedding on high heat between uses, spraying everything that cannot be washed with lysol or permethrin spray, vacuuming every single day and using gloves to handle laundry. We weren't able to get our entire sofa to the storage so we just quarantined all the cushions and are spraying the frame with permethrin every single day. We took like 90% of the kids toys and all the plushies to the storage, only keeping some plastic and wooden ones around. We quarantined our double stroller and are only using baby stroller for now (it's a nightmare to have our toddler walk to places as he keeps running away from us to different directions ugh...) Is this a good routine? Have we missed anything? Should I be using a stronger topical despite being on the Moxi? I've stuck with the aloe vera with lemongrass over sulfur mostly because I'd rather not be a stinky, sticky mess unless I really have to lol. We're avoiding buying a ton of perm because it's so ridiculously expensive here nowadays (used to be 23‚Ç¨ for a tube, now it's 37‚Ç¨!)\n\nSince taking the Moxi I've experienced mild to no itching during daytime but my evening and night itching has definitely intensified. Is this a good or a bad sign? I've never had a rash or visible burrows, no change with that so far. As I mentioned my husband has never had any symptoms so we really have no idea what's going on with him. Kids seem to sleep better at night and my son's rash has gotten a little better, other than that it's a bit hard to tell what's going on with the kids. They still seem to itch atleast a bit but I know that's normal. Our toddler is a bit behind in speech development so he doesn't really have the words to tell us what he's feeling.\n\nAs far as I understand the Moxi keeps my skin poisonous for a month. Can I still re-infect my kids while it's in my system? Our toddler is really clingy and doesn't understand \"no hugs\" so it's really challenging... And ofcourse I need to hold our baby. This is all so, so hard to deal with it while we have the kids to take care of aswell, I'm terrified of what will happen when my husband goes to work. Maybe I won't be able to stay on top of the cleaning routine and screw up somehow :/ We're not entirely sure how long we should keep this current cleaning routine going. \n\nOverall I'm feeling surprisingly positive about this. I want to finally beat this no matter what it takes!",

I just want to clean up ASAP and sanitize everything. \n\nHowever, the apartment literally smells like food for weeks! I live in a 300 sq ft apartment and my bed and clothes also smell like it. I don't want to show up to work as \"the curry guy\".\n\nI have tried many solutions like turning on the fume extractor above the stove, keeping windows open, and using an air purifier with an activated charcoal filter. Nothing works.\n\nWorse, the smell attracts ants! I vacuum and mop the floor every day, wash all dishes immediately, promptly refrigerate unused food (including nonperishable food like dry snacks and seasoning), and obsessively wipe all surfaces with all purpose cleaner several times a day. (I actually developed chronic cough due to chemical pneumonitis from inhaling all purpose cleaner spray so much haha). I have also tried using all methods ranging from Terro toxic ant baits to lemongrass oil. Ultimately, the only thing that prevented ants from coming was to stop cooking for 3 months.\n\nI realize that many other people like to smell food all the time, but not me. I would much prefer that my apartment smells like disinfectant than food. Food smells unclean. Food attracts bugs.\n\nAt this point I am considering two options. First, I could put the crockpot outside on the balcony. Unfortunately, bugs and vermin might get into the pot, and thieves could climb up to my second floor balcony to steal the food (there have been several cases of bike thefts when people put their bicycles on second and third floor balconies and now bicycles on the balcony are expressly prohibited on the lease). Second, I could buy some kind of enclosed box (an aquarium, perhaps?) and put the slow cooker inside. Suggestions?",

The eldest of my three kids got scabies in July from a friend, was diagnosed in August by a dermatologist (GP only prescribed allergy meds which did not work) and we treated everyone in the family with Permethrin immediately as the doctor instructed and repeated the treatment after one week. I changed the sheets, washed everything with hot water or bagged away for 3-4 days, vacuumed everything, mopped the floors with vinegar solution, covered chairs with large plastic bags etc. The oldest, who was the only one to actually have scabies, got better soon and her skin started to heal. But my skin was messed up after the treatment, it was super sensitive and everything was making me itch - tight clothes, tiny hairs and lint from clothes. I could usually sleep at night though. After three weeks of the treatment, my youngest got an extremely itchy pimple-like rash on her buttocks and thighs, I put some diluted lemongrass oil on it, which stopped the itching and the rash was mostly gone on the next day. We saw a doctor, who said it didn‚Äôt look like typical scabies, and tried to do an ink test which was negative, but said that scabies cannot be ruled out and still recommended another round of Permethrin, which we did - once again one application a week apart, this was in second half of September. I kept the cream on myself a little bit longer this time and cleaned even more thoroughly with a steam cleaner I rented. After the 3rd and 4th time using Permethrin my skin became super sensitive again. And once again three weeks later my youngest got a pimple-like rash on her butt, hips, stomach, one side of the trunk. I used lemongrass oil again, most of the rash disappeared but she‚Äôs still quite itchy. Not particularly more itchy during the night, but sleep is a bit disturbed. I am also more itchy than usual, mostly my hands and feet, arms and breasts (which is a new area for me), I also get a few spots here and there, but they go away in 1-2 days. So no visual signs of scabies really, never seen a burrow. My oldest who had scabies confirmed currently has some itchiness on her legs, which I think is post symptoms, because there are no new spots, she doesn‚Äôt really itch at night and it pretty much goes away when she moisturises heavily. But for myself and the little one (we co-sleep btw) the itchiness seems to be getting a bit worse. Or maybe just the oils/moisturisers don‚Äôt help like they used to. I am seeing a dermatologist with the youngest next week, but I am losing my mind while we wait. We could not be having post scabies as we never had scabies in the first place (at least no symptoms at the time the oldest got diagnosed), could we have itching and rash only due to Permethrin? Also the timing of the little ones rash is a bit strange, around the time mites would mature and start to lay eggs (assuming we had scabies mites at the time and some survived treatment)? And it is just me and the youngest who are having these issues and we co sleep. My anxiety levels are high, I keep checking on my skin, I can‚Äôt sleep but instead wait and see if we start to itch, and the thought of going through treatment, having to do all the extreme cleaning and laundry is driving me crazy. I am also not sure if I can take the youngest to kindergarten, which affects my work. \nPlease, has anyone experienced the same when treating due to family member‚Äôs diagnosis? Was it scabies or just side effects of the treatment and if so, how long did it last?",

Some examples from other permethrin leaflets:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>May cause: paraesthesia, pruritus, redness, burning sensation, skin dryness; rarely: oedema, hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The common side effects include skin itchiness, redness  \nand contact dermatitis, etc.\n\n  \nYou can feel such side effects of using permethrin up to one month, even if you didn't have scabies at all. I was never diagnosed with it and my skin felt completely strange for 3 weeks after 2 rounds of permethrin.  \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd would wait for an obvious symptoms of scabies (like intense itching and rashes which do not disappear) and then do the scrape test of these skin areas.  \n\n\nI know it is hard time for you, but when it comes to cleaning of your environment, don't get crazy with that. Please read THE TRANSMISSION OF SCABIES by KENNETH MELLANBY, Ph.D., you can find it here (pages 405 and 406)  \n\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2162942/?page=1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2162942/?page=1) \n\nThis guys if the father of most of the knowledge we have about scabies till this day. Yes, one can still get infested by fomites but just be aware that this is not the main way of how the scabies are transmitted. Just cover the chairs and beds as you did, do the laundry in a higher temperature (60 Celsius is enough), don't use shoes you used before treatment (you can also freeze them below ‚àí10¬∞C for at least 5 hours). And just leave rest of your clothes and don't use them for a week - bagging is not necessary if you don't live in a high humidity environment.  \nJust to be extra safe, use a vacuum with a good filters (like HEPA) and that's it. \n\nBut now, just focus on how to get the scrape test to confirm whether any of you have scabies or just a post. Your eldest one, how she was diagnosed exactly? Scrape test or via dermoscopy?   \n\n\nPS. You should not spend too much time reading r/scabies.",

Then, I'm going to get started on a four foot top bar hive.\r\n\r\nI'm completely ignorant on beekeeping.

It is out of sight, somewhat private.  But, the entrance will be clear for thirty feet.  So, it is pretty much a straight shot in and out of the proposed hive.\r\n\r\nBasically, I'm trying to attract some feral bees.

Really, I just want them for pollination.\r\n\r\nMy concerns are that my bait hive will attract mean honey bees, wasps, or hornets.

You might also want to invest in a pheromone lure to put in your trap. That will attract a swarm if there is one in the neighborhood. You need to catch a swarm with a queen if you are to be successful. If you are way down south beware of killer bees. Always wear a suit when checking your trap just in case. It isn't worth dieing a horrible death for some honey. \n\nAs far north as I am we don't really have 'wild bees'. If a swarm is caught it is usually from someone elses hive and they might want them back. Here it is customary to ask around of the local beekeepers to see if they lost a swam and return them if they have room to hive them. Down south in the warmer climes 'wild bees' are a strong possibility. I used to see a lot of bee trees in Iowa when I was a kid.\n\nBefore you get too far buy [this book](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?kn=The+Backyard+Beekeeper%3A+An+Absolute+Beginner%27s+Guide&sts=t&x=32&y=7) and read it cover to cover twice. This will give you some idea of what you are doing and how to do it right. There are others but this is a great beginners book and will get off on the right foot. If you pursue this clueless it could be very frustrating. \n\nFind your local bee club or at least some old beekeepers, they will be glad to help you out and give you much invaluable advice. Old farts are the shit, I'm not kidding. They will teach you things you can't learn from a book. Hook up with mentors. They might even have some extra equipment, some queen cells and bees, to help get you started. \n\nIt sounds like the site you've chosen for your hive is fine. Warm and sunny in the morning and shaded in the afternoon. Warm the hive up quick but don't overheat late in the day. Bees don't need a whole lot of room in front of the hive. They usually fly nearly straight up to above the tree tops to head off to their foraging grounds. \n\nI've never used a top bar hive but I just downloaded the plans that [Tinfoil put up](http://www.lulu.com/product/ebook/how-to-build-a-top-bar-hive/15321150) and will be trying one this summer. Many thanks to Tinfoil_Haberdashery, you have expanded my horizons and maybe my girth. I'm going to seriously modify my topbar for extreme cold with lots of insulation and see how they do over the winter. \n\nGood luck to you. Let us know how it turns out. There are lots of people on the channel that know what they are doing (I'm not one of them) so if you have any questions, just ask.",

On Saturday, we opened the hive for routine maintenance and found and uncapped swarm cell hanging on the bottom of a frame in the bottom of the hive.\n\nToday, 3-4 days later, I checked the frame and found that it had been capped.  My wife is away and she's the primary keeper as of now.  I'm trying to remain calm in her absence. \n\nShe's read  that once the cell is capped, then the bees would have swarmed already, but I opened that hive today and it was bustling. It rained most of the morning and it's been cool, so I think most of the girls were in for the day.\n\nSo have they swarmed?  Is it a guessing game when this will occur now? \n\nI put the nuc box they came in (with two empty frames) out near the hive and I put a couple of drops of lemongrass oil near it in hopes that if/when they swarm, I'll lure them in. \n\nAny advice? Am I on the right path? Thanks...",

    "body": "So, this was the first week this summer that it's been hot and humid enough that we've been running our AC pretty much nonstop. We have two big heat pumps on one side of our house, about half an acre from one hive and 20 meters or so from another hive. \n\nToday I noticed that bees from both hives were going absolutely insane above the heat pumps. It's hard to tell exactly what's causing it. After some searching, it could be either attraction to moisture evaporating from the heat pumps / attraction to the light flashing off the fan blades, or anger about the noise and vibration, or both. \n\nMy guess is both. They have many sources of water to choose from that I've made as appealing as possible (salt, lemongrass oil, sparkly marbles and glass stones, decaying plant matter, the works), but I've watched many of the bees hover over one of the water sources, then go straight for the heat pumps instead, only to promptly get dismembered. I've also seen a lot of bees crawling across or near the heat pumps dragging their stingers, so some of them are definitely attacking the units, although I don't know if it's because of the vibration or because they smell other dead bees.\n\nAnyway, based on lots of reading around, my ultimate intention is to build a cage around both of the units. I'm going to base the construction on compost bin designs I've found, with fencing covered with #8 wire mesh / hardware cloth. Probably going to have a hinged lid, and also make it light enough that the whole thing can be lifted away for easy access.\n\nUntil I can get all the materials and tools I need for that (learning all of this as I go, woo!), I'm going to get enough #8 mesh to just slap a square over the tops of the units and hold them in place with strong magnets. It won't keep all the bees out but it should at least cut back on the carnage.\n\nHas anyone else had to deal with this? What did you do? Any advice regarding my plans?",

If they are acting aggressively and being drawn to it, it is possible they don't like the sound or vibration and it is aggravating them.",

I cut a hole in the box as I would a swarm trap, applied the scented cotton ball, put it on a picnic table I drug right under the swarm, and went back to enjoying ice-cream with family.  \n\nAbout 30 min later, it was dark, and activity had ceased with only a few dozen bees inside the box.\n\nThe next morning I returned with a hive, also scented with lemongrass oil, and replaced the cardboard box, now mostly devoid of bees.\n\nI fished around among the docile bees stuffing the hole in the tree, looking for the queen--but no luck.\n\nThat's when a city worker came by, gave his blessing to my activity, and let me know that a colony had been in the tree last summer, but didn't survive the winter.\n\nNow I'm thinking the queen is probably already on the old comb, and I'm not likely to get her out.  I could trap them out, but I don't think the city would like me having a hive on their picnic table for what could be several weeks.\n\nThen I remembered the bee vacuum I had built last year.  Maybe I could suck them all up, and maybe get lucky and snag the queen reaching in the hole. I spent a couple hours getting all I could outside and inside the tree.\n\nI had a solid 2 gallons of bees in my bucket when I stopped.  I took the lid off my hive, removed the middle 3 frames, dumped the bees into the hive, and put the lid on, crushing as few bees as possible.\n\nI left the angry bees to themselves thinking I'd either have gotten the queen, and would return to find none in the tree.  Or I would not have gotten the queen, and would find my hive empty.\n\nThat evening, I returned to find neither true.  A large mass of bees was bearded over, and hanging below, the front of the hive. But there was also significant activity in the tree.  \n\nI've just left it the last few days, checking in often.  Activity in the tree persists.  The bearding bees have appeared to take residence in the hive.  I peeked into the lid today and found bees covering the remaining frames (with new waxed Rite-Cell foundation).  They're working, but on what, I don't know.\n\nCan you critique my actions and assumptions? What did I do right/wrong?\n\nWhat now?  When I do a full hive inspection, if I find a queen, I take them all home.  If not, what then?\n\n",

I just removed the excluder when I finished this inspection. \n\nI have nuc boxes ready to go, but I'm fairly new to this and don't know if it's as simple as transferring the old queen with some frames of brood. \n\nI also have swarm traps i can place around my property with some lemongrass oil and previously used frames - should I just try to recapture my own bees?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny input or advice would be appreciated.

If they have eggs, honey and pollen, then no matter what happened, even if you crushed all the queens and the queen cells, they can get queenright on their own again. If not, then we need to know if there are eggs.

Haven't found live bugs at all, but the tenant has been waking up with bites. The tenant decided to toss all furniture including the bed and frame.

If you washed them off with soapy water, that would harm and repel them more than the stuff you're washing off (not much, but still more).\n\nWhen you find a real exterminator, keep in mind the following:  multiple treatments, likely across several months, will be required to clear that unit.  You should also be inspecting and, if anything is found, treating all adjacent units on the same floor, above, and below, if any, and any units adjacent to where more bugs are found, and so on.\n\nTypically a unit under treatment should be carefully inspected weekly.  Once 8 inspections in a row show no bugs, shells, or spots anywhere, (so 2 full months), it is considered clear.  Usually it takes a bare minimum of a month to get to that point, so 3 months total.  Sometimes it takes more than twice that long, especially in cluttered units full of places to hide (actual sanitary conditions have nothing to do with it though).  3 treatments is average, but sometimes many more are needed, and it also varies by the type of long-lasting pesticide surface treatment used as well.\n\nSo when you get a real exterminator, don't assume they're also scamming you because they've been out 3 times, it's been 2 months, and they're still finding a few bugs.  That's normal, even all-but-guaranteed to some extent.  The only thing scammy about the treatments you mentioned are the ineffective natural products.  AFAIK, only Pyrethrinoid insecticides (in a long-lasting surface treatment formulation), silica-dust-based dessicants like CimeXa and food-grade Diatomaceous Earth, and the fungal agent Aprehend (deliberate brand name misspelling) actually kill bed bug infestations effectively, aside from full-building heat treatment.",

My bf says I've always been wary of bleach, but a yr ago my cat passed away and there was a question of if he had been poisoned although the final diagnosis was stroke. Since then, I put the wrong product in my fridge and had my fingers irritated. 2 months on, I was finally putting that fear of touching the fridge to rest ... then I put a product for discouraging cats to urinate on the floor. I followed instructions. I soaked thoroghly and then dried with a rag and then soaked once more as directed. I put a towel down after 20 mins because it was damp so the cat wouldn't step on it as advised. I ended up keeping the towel down there for 24 - 36 hrs without thinking about it. The second morning, I tripped on my cane which had fallen. The towel moved and my hand went on it and then transferred as I scooted on the floor to pull myself up. I washed my hands thoroghly but didnt realize my bottom had also gotten wet and seemed to dampen my computer chair later. Soooo um... thing is...its been 5 days. I felt skin irritation and wore vinyl gloves a lot while trying to build nerve up to wash things as some of its on tech. The walk in clinic said the washing and gloves made my eczema worse. Each day I did little things to make the situation better without cleaning the computer chair or floor where I put it down. Instead, I've been putting towels down on the computer chair and my skin feels damp and irritated if it comes off... and I ended up putting a sheet over the damn towel I put on the floor bc the cat moved the towel around and then began laying on it.. Last night my hands became so irritated by gloves I stopped wearing them after mustering up the courage to launder some of the towels / clothes that had been affected. (I effing washed them three times..sigh) and this mornign I woke up and the cat was playing with bags in the place where the laundry had been (not in a hamper, but I have a proper hamper used now). And when we cuddled I felt irritation on my lap and arms. Its still there. But that's impossible. The product is listed non-toxic with lemongrass oil and cinammon and SLS and it says repeatedly its safe for humans or pets once drying. Just...please tell me my \"irritation is psychosomatic\" or reassure me or tell me how to clean the chair and floor. I am ashamed, terrified, and doing less each day besides cleaning and ruminating on my fear. I KNOW the cat isnt irritated by the product. I want to say the product name but I'm scared someone will tell me it can cause irritation a week on. FWIW the walkin clinic (who I saw for the fall and covid test after exposure) told me there was no sign of chemical burn, no rash besides eczema, and the product was non toxic ...however, poison control said it was non toxic IF I washed it off which I didnt properly with the chair...sorry this is so long.

Candida biofilms are difficult to eradicate and are associated with resistance against many existing antifungals. Thymol which is a major constituent of thyme oil can interfere with biofilm metabolic activity and thus inhibits early and mature biofilm formation.[86] Anthraquinones isolated from Heterophyllaea pustulata showed significant activity against Candida tropicalis biofilm formation by interfering with the pro-oxidant‚Äìantioxidant balance leading to biofilm injury.[149] They also showed synergistic activity with amphotericin B. Geranium oil and its nanoemulsion showed antibiofilm activity against Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, and Candida glabrata. The smaller particle size of geranium nanoemulsion efficiently penetrates biofilms and hence damages the organism's cell membrane.[79] Similarly, cinnamic acid derivatives showed great antibiofilm activity against C. albicans at lower MIC compared to fluconazole. The most active cinnamic acid derivative is a hybrid of cinnamic acid with miconazole that leads to inhibition of biofilm at 2 Œºg/mL and reduction in metabolic activity of preformed biofilm at 8 Œºg/mL.[150,151] Furthermore, lemongrass oil and its major constituents exhibit strong inhibitory activity on Candida biofilm formation, germ tube formation (GTF), adherence, and candidal colonization.[130] Many terpenes including carvacrol, geraniol, and thymol showed strong activity in reducing the development of C. albicans biofilms. Carvacrol was able to inhibit Candida biofilm regardless of the tested species and of the biofilm maturation state.[152]\n",

Should I bump the preservative to 1%?\n\nYou can observe if it's required. For Optiphen Plus, it seems the minimum recommended percentage is 0.75% ? If your formulation is within the recommended pH range, it should be fine for the fungal as long as the percentage is sufficient but you can always observe and increase if required.\n\n>Q: I omitted lemongrass oil because I was worried it would be too sensitizing for my skin. I dont think Im loosing much there. Concern is its listed as an anti microbial sometimes\n\nYou can omit as you feel.\n\n>Q: Should I stick to a cold emulsifier? Not sure what would handle this much oil etc. I have a few on hand but would love opinions.\n\nIt depends on the percentage of lipid the cold emulsifier can take. If not you can just hot process it based on your preference with the addition of the CreamMaker Blend that you have.",

It'll still be edible, of course, because it's all food, so you can still use it. It doesn't ruin the recipe to make that choice. But it's probably now something different from what you set out to do, because the flour served to absorb moisture and hold the food product together. The applesauce added moisture and doesn't hold the thing together.\n\nI think a lot of people have seen those websites that compile reviews people write of recipes online where they say they replaced half the ingredients with random shit and they ended up with a mess, and they got mad at the person who wrote the recipe because they didn't get an edible result. Like, cmon dude, that's on you!\n\nIf you're making lavender lemonade and you decide you'd rather make rose lemonade, that's an easy and workable substitution because the function of the lavender is the flavor.

I tried doing demaree splits this year and one has gone great but the others not so good, I fear. \n\nAnywho, I happened to be in my barn (about 250 ft from where I have 5 hives) this evening (about 6pm) and saw a few bees outside on one corner of the building, maybe 20 bees. I then went inside the house to put on long pants so I could investigate and happened upon a full blown swarm when I got back. I quickly put some frames of old brood comb and a frame of honey into a nuc box along with a few drops of lemongrass oil in the box and on the entrance landing board and set if next to where the swarm was entering the barn wall (in a crack). However, I feel like the bees continued a steady march into the crack of the barn (I assume with her majesty already safely tucked inside).\n\nAny advice would be appreciated because, of course, I don't want a bee colony living in the walls of the barn! This also happens to be the section of the barn where my bee room is located and probably smells like all kinds of good bee stuff.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions and help! \n\nAnnapolis, MD ",

I have a crippling fear of bed bugs, and I‚Äôm struggling to leave the house due to the anxiety around catching them. It also leads me to do research on bed bugs and I find out things that I don‚Äôt really want to find out, adding fuel to the already raging fire. I already spray lemongrass oil diluted with water on me every time I have to leave my house, and on my bed, apparently it deters and kills bedbugs, and I only stand in public transport, but the anxiety is still very much there and present. Does anyone have any advice on things I can do to help the anxiety subside, and if anyone has this problem too, how are you coping with it? I‚Äôm travelling to Manchester soon and the thought of sitting on a train seat is filling me with dread and then having to sleep in a hotel room too is scaring me a lot :/ \nThank you :)",

But what helps most is knowing that 99.9% of the time you wont get bedbugs if you maintain good hygein. It's hard for them to hide anywhere on a body regularly cleaned. It's also fairly easy to check for them on seats benches etc. They don't live long without a host so even if you do find some they are likely already long dead. Just keep in mind chances are still very low and even if you are the 0.001% it's easy to avoid it leading to an infestation.",

I also put a piece of old black empty comb in the bait hive.

    "body": "Last Thursday, a kitten showed up on my lanai, and I've decided to keep him! His name is Herman. I have all the essentials: a cat tree, toys, quality wet and dry food (wet in the morning, dry for lunch and dinner), treats, a cat carrier, and a neuter appointment set up with the humane society. He's been staying in my room since my mom is allergic, and the living room overwhelms him. I think he's around 1-2 months old but I'm not sure.\n\n\n\n**Training Tips Needed:**\n\n1. **Scratching the Bed:** He‚Äôs scratching the side of my bed. I have a cover on it, but I want to prevent this behavior to protect other furniture when I move. Any tips?\n\n\n\n2. **Cord Safety:** He‚Äôs obsessed with my bedside table and cords. I‚Äôve removed some items (like this morning I removed my stones, he hadn't shown interest in them I was asleep not sure if he was playing with them or knocked over while investigating my phone charger). I have removed unnecessary cords but I can‚Äôt eliminate every cord from the room. How can I keep him safe?\n\n\n\n3. **Water Training**: I want to water train him for bathing. I‚Äôve used a waterless bath once (not sure how often to do this) and have an anti-dander spray (yet to use). I‚Äôve also sprayed him with flea/bug spray even though he has no fleas. What‚Äôs the best approach here?\n\n\n\n4. **Harness Training:** I want to take him on daily walks (think it would be nice, to keep him interested & get energy out). I have a leash but no harness yet. He was 3 lbs when he showed up and might be 4 lbs now. Any advice on buying a harness and training him to use it?\n\n\n\n**Other places I need help!:**\n\n**Skincare and Essential Oils:** I make my skincare products, and he likes to lick the whipped tallow on me. I avoid letting him do it excessively. I use tallow, oils like jojoba, beeswax, and essential oils. I know essential oils can be tricky for cats. I keep him away from my diffuser and only use lemongrass oil and lemon juice to combat the litter smell. Any advice on safe plants and oils for cats?\n\n\n\n**Long Road Trip:** We're moving soon, which involves a 10-hour road trip from FL to Mississippi. I plan to have one stop along the way. How can I make this trip comfortable for him? Last night while I watched TV with my mom, I put him in the carrier along with a churro on a lick pad and his favorite toys. I wanted his first carrier experience to be positive before the neuter appointment. It went well he wanted out at first and then accepted it but idk how 5-10 hours like that might work.¬†\n\n\n\nI know this is a lot, but I‚Äôm doing my research and would appreciate any guidance and training tips as I‚Äôm a first-time kitty owner! Honestly, I think he is pretty well-behaved but I don't want to train bad habits and want to make sure I'm doing well as an owner. Thank you! Hope you enjoy this photo of hermie",

That's great!¬† To get started, I always suggest the YouTube channels Kitten Lady and Jackson Galaxy. Between them, they cover everything I've needed to know that wasn't medical advice, for which you should go to your vet.¬†\n\n\nThe most important thing to remember with kittens is that they're the equivalent of children. You can absolutely train them, but they may not always have the patience or ability to learn yet. That's normal and the way to handle it is to kitten proof your home.\n\n\nKittens always do better with a buddy, especially if he's really as young as you say. I would strongly recommend adopting a second similarly aged kitten. It's less work, as they play with each other, but does come with increased costs.\n\n\n\n1. Reward the use of a scratching post nearby and temporarily cover up the area of the bed he scratches. Telling a cat off or pushing him away does nothing, so focus on rewarding instead.\n2. With kittens, covering or removing cords is often the only choice. You can use cat-safe bitter spray on the cord (not on the cat) if he doesn't grow out of it, but for now, kitten proofing is the way to go.\n3. You don't. Cats do not and should not be bathed. That's simply a misconception or an assumption people make because they've had dogs before. Cats really don't need to be desensitized to water.¬†\n4. Jackson Galaxy has great guides on how to harness train and how to find one that fits.\n\n\nI would keep my cat away from all skincare products and would avoid letting him lick Amy of them, unless they're 100% animal fat (lard), but even then, why let him do it. Essential oils range from irritating to lethal to cats, so those are dangerous.¬†\n\n\nCats hate the smell of lemons and citrus, so I'd avoid using that to cover any smell as well. I'd suggest using plant based clumping litter instead, like corn husks or walnut shells. If the litter smells, it's time to scoop -- 2x a day is what I'd recommend.¬†\n\n\nCats can handle long trips, but it really depends on the cat how well they handle it. Take him on a couple shorter trips before then, including to the vet, to gauge how he does. Putting him in the carrier with a treat at home was a good idea to get him used to it.",

        "body": "Tea Tree oil has long been used to treat skin conditions. It seems effective against fungus and the likes. Other oils probably have similar therapeutic effects. However, in its pure form it is very irritating, and its efficacy reduces as you dilute it. \n\nI would stick to the Invermectim for mites, and Metrodinazole for anti-bacterial, as these are formulated for the treatment of rosacea, generally non-irritating and at a percentage which is proved to work in studies.",
