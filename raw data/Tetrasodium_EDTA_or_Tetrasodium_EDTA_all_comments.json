    "body": "Hey everyone! Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here’s a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it’s in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

I recently wrote this... enormous monstrosity on rosacea and shared it over at /r/skincareaddiction, but also wanted to share it here since I have found lots of value in the discussions here as well as the science surrounding AB ingredients (such as snail mucin, propolis, etc.). \n\nIn the future, I plan to do a large post that combines both AB product recommendations and SCA recommendations (as well as mine) for rosacea, but I felt this would be it's own post that I would later connect to this one.\n\nThanks so much for being awesome. I love this sub to bits and frequently come here when I am feeling down or anxious. I hope this helps some of you. <3",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "I just want to preface this post by saying that I like Jaclyn Hill. I bought Champagne Pop when it first came out because 1) I wanted to support Jaclyn and 2) it looked like a beautiful highlighter in a color I don’t have. I thought the highlighter was going to be limited edition….it ended up being permanent and I felt silly to have woken up at a strange hour to order it. I don’t regret purchasing it because its my most used highlighter in my collection. \n\n\nRecently, I saw a review on the eyeshadow palette that is part of this new collection that JH did with Becca. This youtuber (Rita B) was disappointed with the disparity in formula between JH eye palette and other Becca palettes. \n\n\nIt seems as if Becca used cheaper ingredients and a standard formula to mass produce these palettes cheaper and quicker. They cut corners to make more money. So I got curious as to whether the formula for the highlighter was the same or different in the palette vs the single. Lo and behold – it’s DIFFERENT. In the JH face palette, MICA is the first ingredient, whereas in the single TALC is the first ingredient. This leads me to believe that Becca put more fillers in the Champagne pop in the face palette to save production costs. TALC is an additional ingredient in the blush Rose Spritz whereas its not in the regular blush formula. I’m disappointed to be honest. Ingredients are listed below for your reference. \n\n\nChampagne Pop – Permanent collection \nTalc, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isostearyl Alcohol, Petrolatum, Silica, Boron Nitride, Nylon-12, HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone, Paraffin, Microcrystalline Wax (Cera Microcristallina), Polyethylene, Magnesium Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Potassium Sorbate, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Polyethylene Terephthalate, Acrylates Copolymer, Tin Oxide, Tetrasodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.

For instance, while regular MAC brushes are handmade and typically use higher end fibres (real and synthetic), their holiday brush sets are always machine made and low quality fibres. Many companies use cheaper quality ingredients in palettes as the price is quite low for a large number of shades which is more of a pain in the ass to manufacture. A change in ingredients doesn't necessarily automatically equate to a lesser quality, but it's always a good idea to be wary of limited products. I always advise waiting out the first batch if you can, and then read reviews from people you trust or swatch it yourself if you can get the chance. Yes, it's not as exciting and sometimes brands market it in such a way that \"it might be your only chance\" - but it'll save you $$.",

Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you!

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "[I purchased this item myself.](https://i.imgur.com/ZKt37cP.jpg) \n\n\n# Impressions, Fragrance, Packaging\n\nI'm only going to quickly hit some of these points. I'm going to primarily focus my review around the ingredients and my thoughts on the new formulation. I'm sure many others will focus on the rest.\n\nGeneral impressions of the product are great and typical of what we've come to expect from Barrister and Mann. I always enjoy the little goodies and extras thrown in (this time some fitting espresso hard candies). I see BaM is now using the Parkway 100mm low profile jars that have become ubiquitous in artisan shaving soap. I haven't purchased a new soap for perhaps a year — is this a new change or has this been the case for a while?\n\nI personally love the fragrance of Leviathan, though I can understand it can be polarizing. \"It smells like you just smoked a cigar and tried to cover it up with a fragrance\" — my loving wife. That deep, black coffee and leather combination is intoxicating. Soap is frankly a terrible way to experience fragrance, but [I have a bottle of Leviathan aftershave from perhaps 2016 or 2017](https://i.imgur.com/B2z2qwM.jpg) that allows me to pick up the nuance. There's more sweetness and spice in the liquid form. Again, many other Leviathan reviews around talking about the fragrance. I will yield to those.\n\n\n# Performance\n\nWhat can I say? It's superb. A modern classic and a worthy sibling to BaM's other creations. I was hoping it could hold a candle to Reserve - one of my other favorites - and it does; improves even, on some of Reserve's best qualities.\n\nThe lather is so dense [it becomes almost waxy](https://i.imgur.com/SYRsScz.jpg) (I mean that in a good way). It's so water tolerant that it's almost water resistant (again, a little tongue-in-cheek, but I mean it in a good way). Water really needs to be worked into the lather to get the benefit of the performance. It doesn't behave like a \"foamy\" soap. If foamy soaps pull bubbles out of air, this soap instead pulls texture from water. It's thick and smooth. Not foamy and pillowy. \n\nThe slickness and skin feel when shaving is also best-in-class comfortable. \n\nPost shave feeling rivals Reserve. \n\nI would expect a lot of high praise for Omnibus coming soon. \n\n# Ingredients\n\nOk, for the main event.\n\n*Water, Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Tallowate, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Sodium Stearate, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Juice, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Lactate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Tetrasodium Ethylendiamine Disuccinate, Fragrance, Xanthan Gum, Theobroma Grandiflorum Butter, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Potassium Cocoate, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium Ricinoleate, Goat Milk Powder, Persea Grattisima Oil, Sodium Cocoate, Althaea Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Rubra Extract*\n\nI'll give my best insight on the ingredient list. But I'm not an expert and I can only base my insights on my own experience, which is imperfect in itself. You can only glean so much from an ingredient list before it takes the person formulating it to explain the why's and how's. The \"secret sauce\", as it were, is the combination of the ingredients, the relative amounts of each, why each individual component was chosen over an alternative, how they interact and counteract, and the process by which it all comes together. That's not something that we're going to know and that's not something we should expect or ask any soapmaker - or businessperson at large - to divulge. Basically I'm saying that my ability to interpret this stuff is flawed by the very nature of even doing this. I think it's important to have that humility before any of us try to analyze ingredients - myself included.\n\n**Stearic Acid, Tallow, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil**. These are what I would consider the \"base oils\" so to speak. It's sort of the heart of the soap; the unique fatty acid makeup that give the lather a large portion of its performance character once saponified. There is nothing particularly questionable or curious here and I would say we often see high performing soaps with a version of these \"base\" ingredients. \n\n**Water, Coconut Milk, Goat Milk Powder, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Hydroxide**. I'm going to call this collection of ingredients the \"caustic solution\". Both sodium and potassium hydroxide are used as the caustic reagents. Again, nothing particularly unique about that in shaving soap. Both are generally solubilized into water. I'm going to guess that coconut milk and the goat milk powder are added to this solution as well, but it's just a guess. Those things could be added somewhere else. Milks are often substituted for water or in addition to water in an effort to make a lather less pillowy and more creamy. I've never seen any science on that, but that's generally the narrative espoused in the soapmaking community so I'll mention it. Like most things in soapmaking, once you nail down a core formula of ingredients, the other onesy-twosy additives tend to be incremental rather than fundamental, at least in my experience. Enough of those ingredients cleverly combined I think can make for a distinguishable performance difference cumulatively, but it's tough for me to tie one unit of a given ingredient to one unit of performance. So I won't attempt to do that with the milks used here.\n\n**Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Avocado Oil**. This is the superfat. On most ingredient lists, you would not be able to distinguish the superfat from the rest, but Barrister and Mann is one of the few who list ingredients post-saponification, or a little more INCI-compliant. Many ingredients going into the soapmaking process vs coming out of the soapmaking process are compositionally different. Any oils, butters, or triglyceride-containing stuff still in their \"original\" form on this ingredient list means it must be the superfat. I'm of the opinion that the amount and the constituent components of the superfat have a good hand in how the lather behaves and feels. Others might disagree with that, but I'm going to say this unique combination of oils in the superfat probably have a meaningful role in determining how dense, protective, and stable the lather feels on the face. The importance of the superfat I think is particularly unique in shaving soap. \"Stability\" and \"denseness\" of a lather don't really matter in other forms of soap. Body soap, hand soap, even shampoo; most all other surfactant applications are rinse-off almost as quickly as applied. A shaving soap provides critical buffer between an in-motion blade and the skin for minutes at a time, so that kind of thing matters.\n\n**Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Lactate**. We're starting to get into ingredients that can serve more than one purpose, but again, knowing my own interpretations are going to be wrong anyway, I'll go ahead and call these the \"texturizers\". Hydroxyethylcellulose I know to be a thickening ingredient. In fact, when you see any \"cellulose\" on a label, that's generally what those ingredients are for. I've used it a couple times when messing around with making shampoo, but I didn't go much further. I found it to be incredibly finicky. It was stubborn to melt and quickly became tough to work with when cooled. I really don't know what it's used for here. If you've ever made a high stearic soap, you know that it has a tendency to seize up. I wouldn't think you would want to thicken a soap like this - it's the first time I've seen this ingredient in a shaving soap - but I don't know what it behaves like when it's cooking and I don't know the process steps involved to make it. It does make sodium lactate even more curious because I've always used sodium lactate in shaving soap as an ingredient to metaphorically \"even out the high spots\". Things just mix a little easier with it and it cures the soap a little more consistently. Part vanity, part functional. It's also a humectant, so there's a theoretical skin benefit there, too. \n\n**Marshmallow Root Extract, Slippery Root Extract, Xanthan Gum, Saccharide Isomerate**. Let's go with so-called \"skin food\". This far down the ingredient list, I can only more or less guess at some of these. I'm sure Will would raise a skeptical eyebrow or two, but here goes. The extracts are generally what people talk about when you hear the word \"botanicals\". They're extracted components of plants and almost always have a purported anti-irritation or skin-benefitting property. They are very concentrated, and for that reason, you will most always see them at or near the bottom of an ingredient list used in tiny quantities. I haven't used these particular extracts, but I have used others. Xanthan gum could have a few uses. It's in many cosmetics as a thickener and stabilizer, but I included it in this category because I've heard Will talk about it in the context of skin feel. I think I remember he pointed to xanthan gum as a potential cause of poor after-shave feel for those who under-hydrated the previous Excelsior formula. The xanthan gum effectively \"used up all the water\". So maybe the intent with xanthan gum in this formula is to alter the stability of the lather's water-tolerance? Especially seeing how this soap behaves with water; that'd be my guess - used as an ingredient to keep water in the soap and keep the lather from \"breaking\", but who knows. It interacts with water in a big way, though, so I know it must have something to do with that property. Sacharride isometerate is a moisturizer / emollient.\n\nHere's the \"other\" category: **Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate and Glycerin**. Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate is a chelator. It's basically a \"green\" version of Tetrasodium EDTA. Good hard water performance is probably thanks to this ingredient in part. There's nothing special or unique about Glycerin, I just put it in \"other\" because I can't tell if glycerin is an added ingredient or if it's just the glycerin released in the soapmaking process. That's a consequence of how this product is labeled. \n\n**Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid** - I'm putting this one in the \"wtf\" category. No clue what it's used for here. Because of where it appears on the ingredient list, it's not used in negligible amounts, so I have to believe it has some kind of meaningful functional purpose - like a detergent or foaming property or something - but I've never used it or heard of this particular flavor of sulfonic acid. Reading about it doesn't give me any better or more insightful shot at it so I'm just going to leave it at *shrug.*\n\n# My Thoughts\n\nWill has always done a great job pushing the envelope of ingredients in his soaps. In my opinion, he innovates more than probably anyone else in the artisan sphere and doesn't let the sometimes-misinformed or preconceived perspectives of consumers en-masse influence his pursuit. The \"if you can't pronounce it, don't use it\" crowd I think is in stronger force today than it has ever been. \n\nI'm not saying that more ingredients or complicated ingredients = better. But I am saying that there is a vocal group of people with opinions about cosmetics that appear to confuse synthetic for \"dangerous\", and minimal for optimal. And it is great to see that the philosophy at Barrister and Mann is still that the best ingredients must win, not the best-looking-labeled ingredients.\n\nThat is my primary purpose for writing a review up this way. Just wanted to share my perspective on this latest creation and explain how pleased I am to see continual innovation in artisan formulation. I'm probably a little off in my analysis, it's tough to make these kinds of assumptions and generalizations. But that's not really the point. I wanted to make a write-up to bring some attention to this kind of pursuit. \n\nIt takes a ton of work to reformulate a product. I will often see people talk about a new soap fragrance in the same vein as a new soap base. This is understandable. From the perspective of a customer, it's a very similar buying experience and feeling of anticipation. And I'm sure artisans spend enormous amounts of time tinkering with a fragrance. But innovating on a soap formula is a little bit of a different skill and it's a much bigger commitment from the standpoint of the business. There are re-packaging considerations, stability considerations, and most of all, there's a lot of trial and error. In short, it is a risk. Even more so when you're working with ingredients that aren't traditionally used or often used at all in soap.\n\nSo hats off for Omnibus. I'm happy to say it joins the ranks among Reserve and Milksteak as my favorite all-around performers.\n\nCheers!",

        "body": "Okay, full rundown:\n\n>**Stearic Acid, Tallow, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil.** These are what I would consider the \"base oils\" so to speak. It's sort of the heart of the soap; the unique fatty acid makeup that give the lather a large portion of its performance character once saponified.\n\nCorrect!\n\n>**Water, Coconut Milk, Goat Milk Powder, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Hydroxide.** I'm going to call this collection of ingredients the \"caustic solution\".\n\nMostly correct, but I'm afraid that the reason why is a trade secret. :)\n\n>**Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Avocado Oil.** This is the superfat. On most ingredient lists, you would not be able to distinguish the superfat from the rest, but Barrister and Mann is one of the few who list ingredients post-saponification, or a little more INCI-compliant.\n\nCorrect!\n\n>**Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Lactate.** We're starting to get into ingredients that can serve more than one purpose, but again, knowing my own interpretations are going to be wrong anyway, I'll go ahead and call these the \"texturizers\".\n\nLess correct, but you're absolutely right that HEC is a pain to work with; it's going to take me until the third production batch to get some of the stuff to stop seizing into little bits. These two materials are not really related to each other in any functional sense, though; the HEC serves as a lubricant and to help tame the drying effects of xanthan gum, while the sodium lactate is used to make the soap both more pliable when it's hot and harder when it's cool. \n\n>**Marshmallow Root Extract, Slippery Root Extract, Xanthan Gum, Saccharide Isomerate.** Let's go with so-called \"skin food\"...The extracts are generally what people talk about when you hear the word \"botanicals\". They're extracted components of plants and almost always have a purported anti-irritation or skin-benefitting property.\n\nAgain, partly correct. Marshmallow and slippery elm are both skin soothers and moisturizers (their internal \"mucilage\" helps keep your skin feeling nice, and they contain various other classes of molecules that serve as anti-irritants. I actually experimented with using a few other botanicals as well, most notably licorice, but found that most of them provide limited benefit and impart weird colors and/or aromas to the base, which, if I'm being honest, smells faintly of graham crackers off the puck.\n\nXanthan gum serves the same function that it did in Excelsior and Soft Heart, which is as a lubricant. However, as noted, it has a tendency to try people's skin unless you dump HUGE amounts of water into it, so I opted to remedy this effect by replacing some of it with hydroxyethylcellulose, which is much easier on the skin, but not perfect on its own.\n\nSaccharide Isomerate is a contact moisturizer that can tolerate alkaline environments, and the level at which we use it can actually increase moisture retention in skin to which it's applied by as much as 10%.\n\n>**Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate and Glycerin.** Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate is a chelator. It's basically a \"green\" version of Tetrasodium EDTA. Good hard water performance is probably thanks to this ingredient in part. There's nothing special or unique about Glycerin, I just put it in \"other\" because I can't tell if glycerin is an added ingredient or if it's just the glycerin released in the soapmaking process. That's a consequence of how this product is labeled. \n\nCorrect about the TED: it's biodegradable, unlike tetrasodium EDTA, and doesn't present the same \"OMG IT'S POISON\" vibe that the green community has applied to EDTA. Both are harmless, for those curious.\n\nAs for glycerin, we use additional glycerin in the soapmaking process, which is why it appears on the ingredient list so prominently.\n\n>**Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid** - I'm putting this one in the \"wtf\" category. No clue what it's used for here.\n\nAh, the magic material. Also known by its equally inscrutable trade name Rheocare HSP-1180, this is a synthetic anionic polymer produced from renewable feedstocks. It improves lubrication dramatically and imparts a luxurious, talc-like post-shave without sealing the skin or exhibiting comedogenic behavior, meaning that it cannot clog pores or cause breakouts. It's fascinating stuff, and one of the most exciting things that I have ever come across in cosmetic chemistry.\n\n>doesn't let the sometimes-misinformed or preconceived perspectives of consumers en-masse influence his pursuit. The \"if you can't pronounce it, don't use it\" crowd I think is in stronger force today than it has ever been.\n\n>I'm not saying that more ingredients or complicated ingredients = better.

And it is great to see that the philosophy at Barrister and Mann is still that the best ingredients must win, not the best-looking-labeled ingredients.\n\nI too really appreciate your saying this. I believe strongly that much of the improvements that we have seen in the past decade of shaving soap development are due to radical technological advancements over the last 70 years, and it seems absurd to me to exclude things like renewable polymers and chelating agents from that conversation simply because they have scary sounding names. My explanation to folks regarding natural materials is generally along the following lines: Arsenic, cyanide, and lily of the valley are all completely natural. All three will kill you. Painfully. Natural does not mean safe or better, and synthetic does not mean dangerous or bad. They're all just tools.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAll in all, you did really well! It's important that people understand what is being used in the products that go on their faces, and, while there's a \"secret sauce\" aspect to this, but I've said nothing here that someone couldn't learn with Google, and the real secrets are in the proportions and methodologies, not the list itself. I have nothing to hide, and everything that we use is quite safe according to every authority that I can find (that isn't, you know, some dimwit screaming about how \"chemicals\" are bad).\n\nEither way, I appreciate your taking the time to break it down for folks; I mean to put up a blog post on the subject by the end of the week, but we'll see if that actually comes to fruition. :D",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products.

I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "*Moisturisers seem to be the most boring and ignored category in a skincare regime but I have learnt over the years that they actually play the most important role. Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nSo today we have officially released our V3 base after six months of tinkering and testing. Now, I know what you are thinking, “Everyone is coming out with a new base! Grrrr”. This is true, but I dont consider our V3 base to be “New”. To me it is an evolution rather than a revolution. I hate the idea of changing bases. Our goal is to deliver a product that is familiar and high quality. If we are constantly changing our base completely then we run the risk of alienating our customer base and we have no desire to do that. So, with that said; this base is going to be very familiar to our V2 base. If you enjoyed that base then you will very likely enjoy V3.\n\nSo what is different in the version? First, some of the ratios changed a little bit. We wanted to have a cleaner soap in the tub and this helped a lot with achieving that. Next, we removed Tucuma butter and replaced it with Mango seed butter. This was mainly a business decision as Tucuma was becoming harder to source in large quantities. We also added Allantoin and Sodium Lactate. These do great things for your skin and help make our soap a bit more fluid during the cooking phase. And finally, we have Tetrasodium EDTA. This was added to help those with harder water get a better lather. It binds to the metal ions in the water and inactivates them.\n\nSome other updates…\n\n**Northern Elixir -**\n\nOur next release (May 21st) is going to be Northern Elixir! When we first launched we offered this and now we decided to bring it back with an update on the fragrance. We wanted to offer a mentholated soap that was a cheaper alternative then something like Orbit. You can find more details on our upcoming page.\n\n**Orbit -**\n\nOrbit will return at some point this summer. We had a large amount of fragrance compounded for us but UPS delivered an empty box to us. So somewhere at UPS is many kilos of Orbit fragrance sitting around. We have more in the process of being made, so it is coming… eventually.\n\n**Gift Cards -**\n\nWe now offer gift cards for purchase. These never expire.\n\n**Vendor Restocks -**\n\nMany of your favorite vendors have restock orders in with us. We are in the process of packing those orders and will be shipping to them this week.\n\n**International Shipping -**\n\nWe are going to go ahead and open up international shipping for you guys. Shipping cost will likely be pretty high but it's an option if you choose it. We will not be able to ship our aftershaves internationally. If you try, you will get an error at checkout.\n\nThank you everyone for your support!\nwww.nobleotter.com \n\nCody",

So, so, so easy to lather and still produces that rich, dense lather that Noble Otter is known for.  V3 is easier than V2.  \n\n* Slickness is still fantastic.  \n\n* V3 soap still left my face feeling great (incrementally better than V2) once my shave was done.  \n\nLike Cody said, this isn't a reformulation, but some incremental improvements.  \n\nSo Kudos to /u/NobleOtter for making his already great base even better with this new formulation.  I can't wait to pick up some more!",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

I really like gel texture! It's moisturizing and sinks into the skin very fast.\n\nHere are the inactive ingredients:\n>Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Decolorized), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerine, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Purified Water, pvm/ma Decadiene Crosspolymer, Sodium Borate, Sodium hydroxide, Tetrasodium edta.",

Putting down all the reviews at one place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21mqpuxa4p7c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6152cd7496bcfdc6354819d50cab1872dd769b28\n\n**About me**: 25 F; I have combination skin with an oily T zone in summers and dry cheeks and nose in winters. I don't like strong fragrance in products, and I stay away from DIYs\n\n**Skin concerns**: Cystic acne; scars, hyperpigmentation *and* *crying* from the cystic acne\n\nAccording to the brand, All CeraVe products are formulated to be fragrance-free.\n\n*Category 1: Cleansers*\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser**\n\nTexture: Just like its described. It’s a creamy lotion texture out of the bottle. When you add water to it, it foams up and washes off like any other foaming cleanser. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I use it two ways. First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**. Already on 6th bottle. **WRP Forever**.\n\nIngredients AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PCA, PPG-5-CETETH-20, PEG-100 STEARATE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE, ASPARTIC ACID, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, CARBOMER, GLYCOL DISTEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, GLYCINE, TRIDECETH-6, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, THREONINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, ARGININE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SERINE, SODIUM BENZOATE, VALINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, PROLINE, ISOLEUCINE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALANINE, PHENYLALANINE, COCONUT ACID, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, HYDROXYETHYL UREA, CITRIC ACID, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, HISTIDINE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, POLYQUATERNIUM-53, POLYQUATERNIUM-39, POLYSORBATE 60, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n**CeraVe** **Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser (4% Benzyl Peroxide)**\n\nTexture: Translucent lotion-y texture, It’s runnier than the Cream to foam cleanser. Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**. I cut one point for the packaging; It leaked on a flight once. **WRP**\n\nIngredients BENZOYL PEROXIDE 4%\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, SODIUM C14-16 OLEFIN SULFONATE, XANTHAN GUM, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCOLIC ACID, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PROPANEDIOL, CITRIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DIETHYLHEXYL SODIUM SULFOSUCCINATE, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n*Category 2: Serum*\n\n**CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\nTexture: Off-white runny lotion texture. Spreads easily. Not sticky, layers well under other products in my routine. No added fragrance.\n\nApplication: I started with using it twice a week and built up to every day. I use the sandwich method and layer between essence and a moisturizer. I don’t like it. It didn’t do anything for me. I noticed no difference in my skin except a slight smoothing effect. I find it to be a non-offensive beginner retinol.\n\n**5/10**. Excellent packaging. All Retinol products should come in a pump like this. **WNRP**\n\nIngredients: AQUA/WATER/EAU, PROPANEDIOL, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NIACINAMIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, DIMETHICONOL, LECITHIN, SODIUM CITRATE, RETINOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALCOHOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n*Category 3: Moisturizers*\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion**\n\nTexture: Super light gel cream texture. Applies like a dream on my skin. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I apply it after Hada Labo lotion. Used it throughout summer, great stand alone moisturizer. It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes.

For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

Just checking a few new products, I have already spotted it in;\n\n* Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Bubble Foam\n* Heimish All Clean White Clay Foam\n* Holika Holika Smooth Egg Charcoal Egg Soap (Tetrasodium EDTA)\n* Hanskin Hyaluron Essence\n* Purito Green Level Buffet Serum\n* Skin 79 Waterful Deep Cleansing Water\n\nAs the Sherlocks amongst you will have gathered, most of these have a cleansing association.  \n\n**So, what’s it all about?**\n\nDisodium EDTA (short for ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) is a salt of edetic acid and is synthetically produced in a lab.  You will find it in many personal care products, including skincare and shampoos & conditioners and body wash.  It is mainly added as a preservative, to stabalise a formula, helping to give products longer shelf life but it is also used to enhance the foaming action and cleaning action of a cosmetic solution.\n\nAside from this, Disodium EDTA (and its variants tri/tetrasodium EDTA) works as a chelating agent, meaning that it that it binds with trace elements (minerals and heavy metals ions), which can be present in water, and deactivates them. This makes it particularly useful in rinse-off products.  Chelating also play a role in its preservative action as the mechanism stops the cosmetic product from deteriorating and smelling rancid.  \n\nLastly, Disodium EDTA is a ‘penetration enhancer’, helping other actives to penetrate deeper into the skin.  Of course, this is good if everything in the formulation is skin-kind, but not so good if there are some harsher chemicals that are not so skin-friendly.\n\nWhilst Disodium EDTA is classified as an eco-toxin, the FDA show that Disodium EDTA is non-toxic in the quantities approved for over-the-counter use.  Both the CIR Expert Panel and the EU Cosmetics Directive state that the amount of Disodium EDTA contained in personal care products is too low to cause harm to human beings.  \n\nHappy learning guys and let me know if this is helpful or of interest to you.  I could talk about actives all day long but I think there is plenty of information out there about cica, bee venom, snail filtrate, galactomyces, mugwort, rice etc.  Maybe its time we learnt a little more about non-active ingredients, so that we can be a little be more informed and possibly discerning when we choose our skincare.  Let me know your thoughts.  More Non-Active Knowledge to come if you like it.",

As such B&M probably does not need an introduction. But here's a brief one anyway!\n\nBarrister and Mann was founded by Will Carius* in (or around) 2013 as an interest in wetshaving led him into the world of fragrance.  Will has used Barrister and Mann to explore the world of fragrance both past and present; collecting and recreating the formulas for fragrances lost to the ages while also developing some of the most intricate and nuanced original scents in the wetshaving world. In addition to fantastic fragrancing, B&M has been known for some of the best performing products in the artisanal community,\n\nThe Full Measure of Man has absolutely gorgeous label art, the metallic gold on rich burgundy is eye-catching, and the rose- covered skeleton is beautiful. It reminds me of Kelly Mouse's Bertha that has been used in a wide variety of Grateful Dead art. Barrister and Mann uses high quality soap tubs but has been changing varieties over the last year. They all work well. The best part of Barrister and Mann packaging, in my opinion, is the tiny balm tubs. These little jars are adorable homunculi of their larger soap brethren; in addition to their cuteness, they provide easy access to the balm and allow for good regulation of the amount used. Many different soap makers have started producing aftershave balms in the past year, and I think these tubs should be the industry standard for balms.\n\n\nThe Full Measure of Man (missed opportunity not calling it the Full Measure of *Mann*) is Barrister and Mann's first entry into the Tobacco genre since the infamous Roam. \n\"*It was inspired by photos of richly appointed libraries, peppered with winged leather armchairs, a glass of fine whiskey, and the smell of aging teak and mahogany wafting from the shelves. Genteel and smooth, the fragrance combines notes of cured tobacco, sandalwood, Mousse de Saxe (whose inky tang suffuses the entire scent like a whispered promise), citrus, vanilla, resins, myrrh, and geranium. This is one of our best \"classic\" masculine fragrances ever, one to make you feel like enjoying a glass of aged brandy in a bespoke suit before a roaring fire. Simply put, it smells awesome, and so will you. Take advantage of that at your discretion.*\"\n\n\nTFMM is a very traditional scent that makes me feel like an old man, but a distinguished one. The description is spot on. This scent evokes the aged sophistication of a time gone by. The scent strength off the tub is strong and even stronger off the balm. The Full Measure of Man opens with a smooth Mousse de Saxe accord which is immediately elevated and swells to include warm vanilla and sweet citrus. This full accord is supported by notes of cedar and teak which then tapers down into a warm, rich resinous note before traveling on to the long awaited tobacco which is relatively dry with little spice. While the opening notes of TFMM are very creamy and sweet, I find that richness to be tempered by the dry and honest closing note of tobacco.  This is a unique scent.  The closest other I have tried is Catie's Bubbles Connecticut Shade  which has a similar rich vanilla- to -dry tobacco transition, but The Full Measure of Man pulls this off in a significantly more elegant fashion. Still I can see TFMM being a more controversial scent. It doesn't feel particularly modern, or fashionable, but it is an obviously refined scent that would feel right at home at a scotch tasting; it just feels like a bit more of a limited use fragrance. \n\n\nThe Full Measure of Man comes in B&M's recent Excelsior base which lists its ingredients as: *Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Honey, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Milk, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Methyl Gluceth-10, Xanthan Gum, Sucrose Cocoate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Allantoin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lanolin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Fragrance, Sodium Ricinoleate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate*\n\nThe performance on Excelsior is fantastic. This soap takes quite a lot of water and while not the fastest to lather always comes together quickly and consistently. Cushion and slickness are wondeful, touchups are easy without needing to reapply lather, and post shave leaves the skin feeling fresh. Excelsior does not quite push up into the highest eschelons of performance, but it is hard to find any faults with it either. B&M's aftershave balm is moisturizing and refreshing. It is a bit lighter than some other balms I have tried and provides a refreshing continuation to Excelsior's post shave feel. I do look forward to the return of alcohol-based splashes\" but bombs have probably become a permanent part of my post-shave routine.\n\n\nThe Full Measure of Man is not what I typically seek out of Tobacco scents, but it is an unquestionably refined scent that quickly and clearly evokes the memory of an old smoking lounge. It is not my favorite tobacxo scent but I do recognize the elegance in it and find myself frequently drawn to smelling the tub on the shelf.\n\nStill, while being an incredibly well executed scent that I can recognize the artistry in, TFMM is not my favorite scent. It just does not suit my personal preferences for sweet and spicey tobacco. I love Barrister and Mann, and Will's perfumery and TFMM is a refined and well-executed scent that any Tobacco fan should try. Even if the scent does not work for you the fantastic performance of the soap and balm will not disappoint! \n\n\nAs of week 7 the Tobacco Throwdown standings stand thusly:\n\n\n* [#1.

On March 9, 2019 as tribute to the famous children’s book author Dr. Suess. The soap and aftershave feature Barrister and Mann’s latest formulations, Excelsior and Deltus. This limited edition offering will be produced until April 11, 2019. Barrister and Mann will be donating $1 per jar of soap and $2 per bottle of aftershave sold to the Children’s Literacy Initiative ([https://cli.org/](https://cli.org/)). This non-profit works with teachers to advance and improve early literacy in the United States. Barrister and Mann products can be purchased direct from their site and from third party stockists such as: Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nBehold the Whatsis! Is a spring-like scent aimed to remind the user of childhood memories. The scent notes are listed as: Grapefruit, Rose, Dryer Sheets, Tangerine and Sugar. To my nose, the scent opens with a bright semi-sweet grapefruit and tangerine scent that is followed with the floraly rose. As the scent unfolds the sweetness of the sugar begin to dominate. Like so many scents by Barrister and Mann, this is a sum of all it’s parts accord. This is too sweet for my taste and Mrs. Ruds thought it was cute but not something she wants me smelling like. Scent strength is mid-strong off of the sample and remains this way once lathered and shaved with.  \n\nBarrister and Mann Excelsior is a tallow soap that utilizes the following ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Milk, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Methyl Gluceth-10, Xanthan Gum, Sucrose Cocoate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Allantoin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lanolin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Fragrance, Sodium Ricinoleate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate. The soap is on the firmer side of mid and loads very easily into your brush of choice regardless of fiber type. While the soap handles hydration and even overhydration with the most thirsty soaps, overhydration is not warranted. The lather builds effortlessly and it presents itself with the consistency of elmer's glue when dialed in. While it lacks voluminous peaks, it is very dense and protective. The slickness is as expected, oil on glass slickness with residual slickness for days. The post shave is luxurious and leaves the skin both hydrated, protected and feeling supple. The entire experience with this soap base screams luxury. In a crowded space of elite level luxury soap bases, Excelsior stands alone at the top. Excelsior receives a ShaveScore of 98. Soap bases with similar performance are Talbot Shaving and Ariana and Evans.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free,  sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Barrister and Mann Behold the Whatsis!

    "body": "Chelating agents are chemical compounds that react with metal ions to form a stable complex. They help to bind up these metal ions contaminants to keep the product microbe free for longer shelf life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMetal ions without a chelating agent are most likely to cause problems in DIY formulas, including:\n\n* Spoilage and rancidity\n* Degradation of vitamins and essential fatty acids\n* Fragrance/essential oil degradation\n* Discoloration\n* Cloudy formation and precipitation\n* Poor foaming and rinsability performance\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's essential to use a chelating agent if your DIY formula contains: \n\n* Botanical extracts/powders \n* Aloe vera juice/gel/powder \n* Hydrosols/floral waters/distillates/essences \n* Proteins (e.g. hydrolyzed oat and rice protein)\n* Honey and its derivatives (e.g. honeyquat and royal jelly) \n* Herbal/fruit powders\n* Clay\n* Thickening agents (e.g. starches and glucose)\n* Unrefined/unfiltered waxes (e.g. beeswax and flower waxes)\n* Lecithin\n\n# EDTA:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEthylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a molecule which complexes metal ions in aqueous environments. It is available in four neutralizations, two of which, disodium EDTA and tetrasodium EDTA are commonly used in the cosmetics. The choice of which product to use is determined by the intended pH of your product.\n\nDisodium EDTA is commonly used in neutral to mildly acidic products, such as toners, serums, creams, and neutral pH cleansers. Tetrasodium EDTA is recommended for alkaline products, like cleansers and shampoos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecommend usage rates:\n\n* Disodium EDTA = 0.1%-0.3%\n* Tetrasodium EDTA = 0.1%\n\n# Other chelators:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease keep in mind that disodium EDTA is a strong chelating agent than any of these chelators. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGlucono Delta Lactone is a polyhydroxy acid, the next generation of alpha hydroxy acid. It is recommended for acidic formulas. When it is dissolved in water, it will slowly hydrolyze to gluconic acid which produces gentle acidification in the same way as lactic acid-producing bacteria. It has several benefits: moisturizing and hydrating effects, may even smooth skin texture, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSodium phytate is an alternative of disodium EDTA and tetrasodium EDTA. It is the sodium salt of phytic acid and a natural substance found in plant seeds. It can be used in acidic and alkaline formulas. It has additional benefits: moisturizes skin, improves skin elasticity, normalizes oily skin, may help reduce pore size, helps lighten skin, and may help improve the appearance of cellulite. It has a pH of 12 - may need to adjust the pH's formula to bring it down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCitric acid is widely used in cosmetics to adjust pH in formulations, has mild chelating properties, and is also used as an antioxidant to improve the effects of other antioxidants. Citric acid is intended for acidic formulas only.  This shouldn't be the first choice for chelating agent especially if your DIY formula has too many botanical extracts or a high percentage of aloe vera/hydrosol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecommended usage rates:\n\n* Glucono Delta Lactone: 0.1%-1%\n* Sodium phytate: 0.1%-0.5%\n* Citric acid: 0.1%-1%",

This soap, aftershave and Eau de Toilette will be available for purchase exclusively at WCS on February 14, 2019. Beaudelaire is inspired by the controversial poet, Charles Beaudelaire. Barrister and Mann products can be purchased direct from their site and from third party stockists such as: Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)), West Coast Shaving and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nBeaudelaire is a fougere accord that sits atop a base of Mousee de Saxe. Scent notes feature Lavender, Oakmoss, Coumarin, Ylang Ylang, Rose, Sandalwood and Mousse de Saxe. The resulting fragrance is both clean cut and dirty as it unfolds. Opening with a clean, classic fougere smell, the fragrance quickly incorporates the Mousee de Saxe with its tenebrous and leathery dirtiness. This is a masterpiece scent that is widely loved in it’s elegance and depravity. The fragrance is a multi-occasion wear based on it’s unfolding complexity and is best suited for darker months, where a heavy scent is desired. Scent strength is mid-strong off the container and remains this way as lather is developed. Scents with some similarity from wet shaving are: Reef Point Soaps Fougère Santal and Barrister and Mann Lavanille.\n\nBarrister and Mann Excelsior is a tallow soap that utilizes the following ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Milk, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Methyl Gluceth-10, Xanthan Gum, Sucrose Cocoate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Allantoin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lanolin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Fragrance, Sodium Ricinoleate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate. The soap is on the firmer side of mid and loads very easily into your brush of choice regardless of fiber type. While the soap handles hydration and even overhydration with the most thirsty soaps, overhydration is not warranted. The lather builds effortlessly and it presents itself with the consistency of elmer's glue when dialed in. While it lacks voluminous peaks, it is very dense and protective. The slickness is as expected, oil on glass slickness with residual slickness for days. The post shave is luxurious and leaves the skin both hydrated, protected and feeling supple. The entire experience with this soap base screams luxury. In a crowded space of elite level luxury soap bases, Excelsior stands alone at the top. Excelsior receives a ShaveScore of 98. Soap bases with similar performance are Talbot Shaving and Ariana and Evans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Barrister and Mann Beaudelaire (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Caldera” (purchased)\n* Razor - Martinez Blades Bullmastiff (purchased)\n* Post - Brut (purchased)",

    "body": "[The Tobacco Throwdown Round 7 - Maurer & Wirtz Tabac Original](http://imgur.com/gallery/0i4MyQ5)\n\n\n* **Brush:** Turn N Shave Barberpole\n\n* **Razor:** Charcoal Tech\n\n* **Blade:** Gilette Silver Blue\n\n* **Lather:** Tabac Orignal\n\n* **Post:** Stirling Shave Balm Unscented\n\nWhen my interest in tobacco scented soaps began I started to hear rumblings from the corners of the internet about a legendary tobacco scent of yore. A soap that would seperate boys from men, and a must try for anyone claiming to love tobacco scents. I am of course referring to the OG tobacco shaving soap out of Germany, the infamous *Tabac Original*.\n\n\nFounded in 1845 in Stolberg Germany Maurer & Wirtz soapworks is certainly the lingest running company that will be featured in the tobacco throwdown. 114 years later in 1959 Maurer & Wirtz began producing *Tabac Orignal* shaving soap. The soap has become a staple in the wetshving community known for its good performance and divisive fragrance.\n\nTabac Original comes standard in a heavy ceramic bowl with a wooden lid, branded with the retro and clean Tabac logo. It is  nice solid presentation, but nothing fancy. Tabac is also available in refill pucks which is what I have obtained for this review.  \n\nTabac is an old fashioned barbershopish scent with lots of florals and musks.  Unlike the rest of the soaps I have reviewed in this series Tabac is based on the scent of the Tobacco Flower as opposed to a cured tobacco leaf. Really this is comparing apples to oranges, but I did not feel that this reveiw series would be complete if Tabac were excluded.\n\nThe scent notes listed for Tabac Orignal are :  \n\n*Pepper, Petitgrain, Citrus & Neroli.*\n\n*Lavander, Camomie, Geranium & Oak Moss.*\n\n*Carnation. Sandalwood, Vetiver, Moschus(musks) & Ambergris*\n\nTobacco is conspicuously absent from the list but I did find it listed some places and exlcuded others. I ended up using the listed scent from the Tabac website.\n\nTabac is a smooth, leathery and powdery scent. I get bits of pepper and the underlying astringency of citrus that leads into a soapy air of lavender, but a light one that does not sparkle as much in Tabac as in many other scents.  The lavender leads into a strong heart of vetiver supported by sandalwood and musks with just a touch of distinctive ambergris to close things out. There are no distinct tobacco scents, but I can see Echoes of other tobacco flower fragrances I have used. I did not obtain the Tabac aftershave or Edt for this review and I have read conflicting reports as to whether or not those products maintain the same scent profile.\n\nWhile Tabac was introduced in 1959 its scent feels like it belongs more in the period of Mauer & Wirtz's founding, the mid 1800s. This is an extremely old fashioned and masculine fragrance. If the Full Measure of Man is a scent that makes me feel old and distingued, Tabac just makes me feel old and dessicated. It's a soapy scent that manages to not quite feel clean. I think a lot of that comes from the musks which just do not agree with my sensibilities.\n\nI am sure that this is a controversial take. After all several people here on reddit recommended this soap to me. But Tabac just does not connect for me.\n\nWhile I am not a fan of the scent of Tabac performance is definitely where this soap shines. Tabac is another hard puck soap like Pre de Provence No. 63, but Tabac has much better performance. The listed ingredients for Tabac Orignal are: *Potassium Stearate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Sodium Tallowate, Parfum, Sodium Cocoate, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Sodium Hydroxide, CI 77891, Limonene, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Coumarin, AlphaIsomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Geraniol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Isoeugenol, Benzyl Alcohol, Citral, Eugenol*\n\nTabac being a hard-pucked soap should last basically forever. I find that scooping a small chunk and blooming it in my lather bowl provides the best results, and I would think blooming is even more important for those who choose to brush load.  Tabac quickly works up into a thick creamy lather with great slickeness and cushion and plenty of residual slickness to touch up any trouble areas with no  need to reapply lather. Post shave feel os solid but nothing too special. I do not know if this is the original formulation of the Tabac shaving soap, but if so I am thoroughly impressed. Tabac provides the best performance of a mass market shave soap that I have tried so far. I would rate this soap as similar to Chiseled Face and Oleo Canard bases for performance.  \n\n\nWhile the rugged and Original scent of Tabac may not be a crowd pleaser the solid and consistent performance of the soap itself should be. There is a reason Tabac is so oft lauded across shaving forums large and small: this is a solid soap that lead the curve i  performance long before the advent of the modern artisinal market.\n\nWhile Tabac is a must try for every Tobacco lover (if only to say they have tried it) and a good recommendation for fans of traditional barbershops it just cannot keep up with the stiff competition from the rest of the Throwdown. Overall Id rate Tabac as dead last, 8/8 of the soaps I have reviewed so far.  It is a dated scent and does not present itself with nearly the same refinement as TFMoM the other 'old-man' scent I have reviewed for this series. Tabac does brings neither sweetness or spice, either of the things I love so much in so many tobacco scents.\n\nAs of week 8 the standings for the Tobacco Throwdown are:\n\n* [#1.

Some tobacco smells like raisins to some and other tobacco smells like tea.  Sometimes it smells like generic dry leaves.  All over the place.  Also, a lot of tobacco is flavored.  When people think \"tobacco odor\" they think about smokers stench... that's pretty consistent.\n\nTo me it smells like it has tobacco in it but the funk in it does overpower other scents in it.  The musk and ambergris is prominent.  It smells like sweaty balls with a tiny little bit of talcum powder and a bunch of other stuff.

Even with my softest gel-tipped badger, the stuff loads like a dream to produce a pasty proto-lather that is then ezpz to hydrate into the good slick stuff.  In contrast to DR Harris, Tabac has zero propensity to froth if loaded with a brush that's too wet.  I'm guessing that the high proportion of K-salts and the bias towards \"heavier\" fats (stearic and tallow over coconut oil) are the main reasons.\n\nAlso notable: Tabac is available in what is probably the most ergonomic shave stick in existence.  The diameter is large and it goes on really easy, the cover fits snug, and the push mechanism works.",

DHC Suncut Q10 EX Gel - 80gm\n\n⛅️ SPF Rating: SPF 50 P++++\n\n🌥 Usage Period : Jan - July (not regularly but whenever I went out in sun which is 2-3 times a week)\n\n🌥Price: ₹2395 for 80g\n\n💥 I got it on a Nykaa sale. DHC cleansing oil 70 ml + Sunscreen at ₹1450💥\n\nIngredients: Water/aqua/eau, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, alcohol, isononyl isononanoate, polymethyl methacrylate, pentylene glycol, zinc oxide, cyclopentasiloxane,bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol\nmethoxyphenyl triazine, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, vp/eixosene\ncopolymer, methyl methacrylate crosspolymer,\nethylhexyl triazone, titanium oxide, ammonium\nacryloyldimethyltaurate/beheneth-25\nmethacrylate crosspolymer, phenoxyethanol,\nacrylates/dimethiconecopolymer,\nisohexadecane, sodium acrylate/sodium\nacryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer,\ntriethylhexanoin, ethylhexylglycerin,\npolyhydroxystearic acid, isostearic acid,\naluminum stearate, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, tetrasodium edta, caprylic/capric triglyceride, alumina, silica, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, sodium hydroxide, t-butyl alcohol, laminaria ochroleuca extract, ubiquinone, sodium hyaluronate.\n\nTexture: Extremely Lightweight, No white cast, feels like a light moisturiser, A little runny!\n\nMy views: \n\n✨ When it comes to a minimal skincare routine, this one is my absolute favourite. On mornings when I’m late for work, and have no time for an elaborate skincare routine, this one comes handy. And even when I’m not in a hurry, I choose this while going out because I do not like layers of skincare on my face while I’m out. \n\n✨After application it takes a minute to seep into the skin and gives a beautiful dewy finish. I find it’s texture is quite similar to Paula’s Choice Youth Extending SPF but the DHC one has a white coloured cream which takes a minute to settle. \n\n✨It’s fragrance free and non irritating for my acne prone skin. So far I’ve never encountered any stinging near eyes or overall. And also no contact dermatitis or sudden breakouts. And as for added advantage- it’s hydrating and moisturising enough for entire day. In fact, I’ve been complimented by my colleagues for looking glowy!! 🙈\n\n✨ BUT I feel it’s too overpriced for the quantity and if it were not for that offer on Nykaa, I would have never purchased the sunscreen.\n\n✨ The key ingredients marketed in the sunscreen are: \n\nCoenzyme Q10: Hydrates skin and helps fight\nsigns of aging such as fine lines and loss of\nelasticity\n\nOlive Virgin Oil: Rich in antioxidants, it maintains the skin's moisture barrier and helps fight damage caused by free radicals without clogging pores.\n\nHyaluronic Acid: Helps maintain skin's firmness\nand hydration\n\nLaminaria Ochroleuca Extract: Rich in minerals\nand amino acids, it conditions and soothes skin.\n\n✨ A lot of DHC products are marketed with Olive Oil, including their cleansing oil. And DHC is charges a pretty hefty price for this basic ingredient. \n\n✨The sunscreen comes in a tube packaging with a screw cap and is easy to squeeze and use due it’s tiny opening. Aids in 2 finger rule measurement.\n\n✨I would repurchase it if I get a similar offer but unfortunately I cannot find the sunscreen anywhere. I think the brand has discontinued it, it’s not even listed on their website anymore. Really upset with this discovery because I thought I had found my HG sunscreen to buy at sales. \n\n2. Loreal UV defender Correct and Protect (tinted sunscreen) \n\n⛅️ Usage: April 22 - July 22 (not regular)\n\n⛅️ UV Rating: SPF 50+ Pa++++\n\n⛅️ UV Filters: Hybrid Filters\n➖ Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (aka Octinoxate, Octyl Methoxycinnamate)\n➖ Drometrizole Trisiloxane (aka Mexoryl XL)\n➖ Titanium Dioxide\n➖ Terephthalylidene\n➖ Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid \n➖ Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoy Hexyl Benzoate \n➖Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol\n➖ Methoxypheny1 Triazine C\n\nPrice and Ingredients are available on every website so y’all can check it out there. There’s always an offer and I got it at ₹ 500 from Myntra\n\n⛅️ Texture: Serum like, Kinda hard to spread evenly tho! Takes a while for blending it.\n\nMy Views: \n\n✨ I was extremely excited when it launched since I had never used a tinted sunscreen sadly it wasn’t completely the way I expected it to be. However, as I’m not into makeup, this is an average substitute for tinted cream to cover my light acne scars. \n\n✨ The tint is peachy orange and it’s a little darker for my skin tone so blending is extremely important otherwise it looks patchy. Takes a good 5 mins to blend it in properly. \n\n✨ Me being a lazy perfectionist- makes it a quite difficult for to reach for it everyday. The sunscreen gives my skin a finish which is somewhere between dewy and matte. \n\n✨ Apart from texture and coverage, it’s enriched with vitamin C in form of Ascorbyl Glucoside. And has hybrid filters. I do not have indepth knowledge of sunscreen filters but y’all can look them up on inci decoder. \n\n✨ The sunscreen has a mild fragrance but doesn’t linger much and isn’t irritating considering perfume is the last ingredient in the list.\n\n✨I LOVEEEE its packaging tho, it has a thin nozzle which makes it easy to remove the sunscreen on your fingers. The package has a plastic squeezy bottle with screw cap. \n\n✨ Overall, it’s an average sunscreen according to me and my experience. I don’t hate it, it’s an okay product which I would definitely finish up but wouldn’t repurchase. \n\nTHAT WAS HELL OF A LONG REVIEW LOL. Been writing it since a month and finally posted!! Hope y’all find it helpful :).\nWill be posting part 2 soon!",

On November 29, 2019, the set became available to everyone and was released as a winter seasonal. Barrister and Mann products can be purchased direct from their site and from third party stockists such as: Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nNordost is an elegant citrus fragrance that is complimented by a faint smoke. Scent notes open with delicate, true to life orange with an ever so soft hint of smoke. For me this smells like an orange peel that’s been hit with a flame before being a garnish for a high end cocktail. Despite its simplicity, this is a wonderful fragrance. Mrs. Ruds approved of this scent and enjoys when I wear it. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the container and remains this way through the shave. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Eleven Organic Sweet Orange as a similar scent profile.\n\nBarrister and Mann Excelsior is a tallow soap that utilizes the following ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Milk, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Methyl Gluceth-10, Xanthan Gum, Sucrose Cocoate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Allantoin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lanolin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Fragrance, Sodium Ricinoleate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate. The soap is on the firmer side of mid and loads very easily into your brush of choice regardless of fiber type. While the soap handles hydration and even overhydration with the most thirsty soaps, overhydration is not warranted. The lather builds effortlessly and it presents itself with the consistency of elmer's glue when dialed in. While it lacks voluminous peaks, it is very dense and protective.

    "body": "I meant to put i made a 2% BHA exfoliant not toner, but I can't edit the title TT\n\nHey y'all!\n\nFor the longest time I've seen and heard from people struggling with dissolving salicylic acid and keeping it dissolved. So I did a bunch of research and even helped someone fix a there formula and they gave me feedback saying the SA had not recrystalized so far (YAY!) [This should be it](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/ibfy8b/need_help_simple_questions_basic_beginners_help/g20l949?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). If I linked the wrong thread just tell me. I also shared this somewhere don't remember where.\n\n\nAnyway, I came here to share my thought process and see if anyone had any extra ideas so that others could benefit. I didn't really know how to start with this because while I got the idea from Paula's choice I didn't really make te formula from that... but I'll start with Paula's choice.\n\n\nPaula's choice 2% BHA Exfoliant:\nWater (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n\nPaula's choice Regular Strength Anti-Redness Exfoliating Solution With 2% Salicylic Acid Ingredient list:\nWater (Aqua), Dipropylene Glycol (hydration), Pentylene Glycol (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Glycerin (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Panthenol (hydration), PEG/PPG-17/6 Copolymer (texture-enhancing), Methyl Gluceth-20 (hydration), Glycereth-26 (texture-enhancing), Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (hydration), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer), Sodium Metabisulfite (stabilizer).\n\nAs you can see I linked two ingredient lists for 2 bha products but formula is more based on the first one. I linked the second one as a reference due to the fact that it used way more glycols and that plays into my dupe?\n\n\nAnyway: the Paula's choice 2% BHA exfoliant ingredient overview:\n\nWater: water\n\nMethylpropanediol: humectant, solvent, helps with absorption of Salicylic acid. \n(I have no earthly idea where to get this ingredient, so I'm not including it at all)\n\nButylene Glycol: humectant, solvent\n(I used Propylene glycol instead of this)\n\nSalicylic Acid: the reason were here\n(This is going to be dissolved in the propylene glycol)\n\nPolysorbate 20: helps stabilize the Salicylic acid and keep it from recrystalizing\n(Gonna use this anywhere from 2 to 5%)\n\nCamellia Oleifera Leaf Extract: Green tea extract\n(Not necessary, but nice. You could use the powdered at 0.5% or the liquid at like 1 to 2%)\n\nSodium Hydroxide: ph adjuster\n(I would use this at the end to adjust the ph)\n\nTetrasodium EDTA: stabilizer, chelating agent\n(You could leave or keep this in. The Paula'schoice BHA doesn't have a preservativebecause of the high amount of humectant/glycols in their formula I believe)\n\nNow you are starting to see why this isn't exactly a dupe.\n\n\nNow let's start explaining. Making cosmetics says that SA is 3 to 6% soluble in Propylene glycol. That means you need to make a salicylic acid solution in Propylene glycol at 6%. This 6% SA solution in Propylene glycol (were just gonna say PG cuz I'm tired of typing this out) needs to be used at 33% of the total formulation to get 2% salicylic acid in our formula. Does this make sense?\n\nNow here is the formula that's not really a dupe that I posted in the thread link I shared earlier.\n\n2% Salicylic acid\n\n31% propylene glycol\n(Or 33% of a 6% salicylic acid solution)\n\n1% Sodium citrate\n\n5% Polysorbate 20 (you might have to lower this depending) (you could also replace this with poly 80, peg 40 hydrogenated castor oil)\n\nAnd then use water to 100 (or 61% in this case)\n\n\nThe sodium citrate is used to help make sure the SA doesn't recrystalize and could also function as a ph adjuster. The polysorbate was used at 5% cuz I was terrified it would recrystalize, you could lower this, but definitely use at least 2%). I did not mention a preservative in the formula i gave her because I forgot. I would put one in because I don't trust my formulation skills or sanitation. Replace some of the water with a preservative of your choice. \n\nThe original person a made this formula for said it had a greasy feel. This is definitely due to the high amount of PG and may be partly due to the polysorbate 20. But it didn't recrystalize so that's a win??? The skin feel can definitely be improved upon though lol.\n\n\nNow here is a version I've been trying to work on that is slightly more like a dupe (if you squint): I have yet to try this.\n\n2% Salicylic acid\n\n31% propylene glycol\n(Or 33% of a 6% salicylic acid solution)\n\n1% Sodium citrate\n\n3% Polysorbate 20 (I lowered this)\n\n0.5% powdered green tea extract (or 1 to 2% liquid)\n\n0.2% Tetrasodium EDTA \n\nAnd then use water to 100 (or 62.3% in this case)\n\n\nA really important tip is to make sure the Exfoliant is above 3 in ph. The Paula's choice one has a ph between 3.2 and 3.8. If the ph of it is too low the SA will recrystalize. Please remember this. In fact I remember reading somewhere at ph lower than 3.5 you often get SA precipitating out of the solution...\n\nNow can adjustments be made? Absolutely 💯. Please play with this. I really want to olimprove the skin feel of this product. Now that I've found that it doesn't recrystalize with this, I plan on trying to slowly lower the amount of propylene glycol to see how low I can take it before the formula starts hating me 😆. \n\n(And I want to make a gel out of it. Like a thicker serum type with more good skin feeling ingredients. Maybe use something like sepigel 305 so I can add silicones and get a gel cream. Can it even handle acids... Hmm)\n\n[Here is a link to a chemists corner thread](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/comment/20464#Comment_20464) that helped me a lot.\n\nYou could add other humectants too. This could be very helpful with hydration and helpful in keeping SA solibulized. I wanna see if I can add glycerin and socium lactate. Allantoin, other extracts, and etc!!! THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER ( absolutely wrongnuse of this quote...)\n\nYou can buy pre solubulized SA from making Cosmetics if you don't wanna go through all this trouble ( I'm currently stuck with 100g of SA so...) you could say flip it all and use alcohol. Or you could use octyldodecanol (i think that's what it's called) also sold at making cosmetics. Better than PG worse than alcohol. \n\nFeel free to share, give advice, but please point back to his thread so we can get some knowledge 😉. I will be posting an updated formula with more goodness added and a better skin feel... in the near future.... honestly I remember....\n\nNext on my list? Urea. It shall be conquered. I will make a basic formula out of you that I can share. I will. Once you come in the mail 😀",

I was in my thinking zone and randomly this thought popped in my head.\n\n>**Why can't I use my Dove soap bar as shampoo?**\n\nSo, when I went to take my shower, I did my first hair wash with usual shampoo (I used L'Oreal Paris 6 oil nourish shampoo) and then I took a chunk of my hair \\[cuz first time skeptical (?)\\] and applied Dove soap bar. Lathered it up and rinsed off. I skipped using conditioner so as to notice if there will be any difference. To my surprise, I felt that my strands were a bit moisturized.\n\nWhen I looked up for the ingredients and their properties in hair care, most of them were good except for **Sodium Chloride**, which can dehydrate hair shaft. I also checked by putting the ingredient list in to ***isitcg*** website and it said CG Approved (but with cautions)\n\n    Ingredient list:\n        Sod. Cocoyl Isethionate, Stearic acid, Sod. Palmitate, Water, Lauric acid, Sod. Isethionate, Sod. Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sod. Palm Kernelate, Perfume, Sod. Chloride, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Glycerin, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Citric acid.\n\nIf you are concerned about pH, Dove bar's pH is in between 6-7 (I didn't check myself, I googled for this) which is neutral.\n\nI'm planning to wash my hair entirely with this soap bar and see myself how it works. I'll update how it goes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note:** I have really short hair (4'' long). My hair type - oily scalp with normal-dry hair.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm not an expert in ingredients analyzing and their chemistry. It's just a thought that occurred to me and I wanted to check myself. If you want to try it for yourself, proceed with caution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany thanks!",

    "body": "Hello! So I've recently fallen in love with swimming as an exercise mainstay, and as a result ,my hair is suffering greatly. I've been taking all the easy precautions like wetting my hair with clean water before getting in the pool and wearing a swim cap, but now I'm looking to specific products that help with removing buildup from chlorine and other pool chemicals. In my research, the only ingredients I've found that are good for this purpose and commonly found in clarifying shampoos and some conditioners are:\n\n* Sodium Thiosulfate ([neutralizes chlorine](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n* Disodium/Tetrasodium EDTA ([chelating agent](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n\nWhich brings me to my question, which is a little silly and neurotic, but I hope someone can help me. I've really fallen in love with this [L'Oreal Kids 2-in-1 Swim Shampoo](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/hair-care/products/shampoo/loreal-kids-extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo.aspx?shade=extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo). I just love how it smells, I love the bottle, I love how cheap it is, and I love how it reminds me of when I was a kid! Upon looking into the ingredients though, I found neither Sodium Thiosulfate nor EDTAs among them. Here they are listed out:\n\n>AQUA/WATER/EAU • SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE • DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE • PEG-200 HYDROGENATED GLYCERYL PALMATE • POLYSORBATE 20 • SODIUM CHLORIDE • PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE • HEXYLENE GLYCOL • DISODIUM RICINOLEAMIDO MEA-SULFOSUCCINATE • PARFUM/FRAGRANCE • SODIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • POLYQUATERNIUM-10 • SODIUM METHYLPARABEN • MAGNESIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • MAGNESIUM LAURETH SULFATE • SODIUM OLETH SULFATE • DMDM HYDANTOIN • MAGNESIUM OLETH SULFATE • CI 47005 / YELLOW 10 • CI 14700 / RED 4\n\nBasically I want to know, am I missing something? How can L'Oreal confidently claim that this shampoo \"removes chlorine\" if there are no ingredients that are specifically capable of that? I like this product a lot and want to continue using it but I also want to make sure I'm getting all the pool chemicals out of my hair after I swim.\n\n^(In before \"just use it if you like it,\" I know my question is kinda silly, I just want to understand how these ingredients work!)",

This one man band is based out of Morenci, MI and is highly passionate about every single aspect of running this successful small business. Declaration Grooming is available for purchase direct from their website and also stockists such as Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)). \n\nSellout is based on the famed Aventus by Creed. Declaration Grooming has done a really nice job of duplicating the scent, which features notes of: Pineapple, Birch, Black Currant, Musk, Oakmoss, Bergamot, Apple, Patchouli, Ambergris, Jasmine, Vanilla and Rose. This scent is one of the most favored in wet shaving and for good reason. It is complex and masculine. I am initially met with a smoky pineapple and black currant shot before the scent becomes too complex to pull out individual notes. This is a scent I would consider a multi occasion user and also a multi-seasonal wear. Scent strength is strong off my sample and remains strong once lathered. Similar scents from wet shaving are: Ariana & Evans Spartacus, Fine Accoutrements Platinum, Stirling Soap Co. Executive Man and Viking Soaps Ragnar. \n\nDeclaration’s Icarus soap base is truly amazing. This base is immediately in the driver seat as a contender to be a consensus favorite performing soap base. This soap base is firm and care must be taking to load the brush. The base demands to be fed water. When properly dialed in, the lather is both voluminous and dense, similar to sour cream with a radiant sheen. The slickness of this soap base, including residual slickness is elite level. The post shave is also absolutely elite and among the most luxurious post shave feelings available. The ingredients in the soap base are:  Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Mango Seed Butter, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Bison Tallow, Lamb Tallow, Colloidal Oatmeal, Goat's Milk, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tussah Silk. The ShaveScore for Icarus is a 96. Given this rating this soap base performs similarly to both Ariana & Evans and Wholly Kaw Bufala.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Soap - Declaration Grooming Sellout (PIF)\n* Brush - Frank Shaving 30mm 2 Band Finest (promotional gift)\n* Razor - Boker “Elite” (gift)\n* Post - Fine Accoutrements Platinum (purchased)",

The new scent also marked the release of their new Excelsior soap base, which aims to incorporate all learnings from the previous Barrister and Mann soap base iterations. Barrister and Mann remains committed to excellence and it is evident that the company isn’t resting on their past success. In addition to ordering direct from Barrister and Mann, their offerings can also be found at several third-party resellers including: Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nVespers idealizes the world famous Goslar Christmas Market (http://www.germany-christmas-market.org.uk/goslar\\_christmas\\_market.php). The scent represents the not only the region, but also the time of year and the traditions associated with it. Featuring notes of: Cranberry, Rose, Sandalwood, Fougére Accord, Patchouli, Geranium, Cardamom, Balsam Fir, Mousse de Saxe, Bergamot the scent is warm and inviting. In typical Barrister and Mann fashion, the scent brings its user on a journey through a memory. The scent opens with tart-fruity cranberry that is complemented by cardamom. The fougere accord rolls into the picture next before the Mousse de Saxe’s velvety touch pulls the accord into a smooth finish.The scent is an absolute must for the cold dark months of winter and not necessarily a Christmas time only scent. Scent strength is mid-strong. This scent accord is insanely unique, I cannot do it a dis justice by offering any comparisons.\n\nBarrister and Mann already holds the title of best soap base on the planet, perhaps even the galaxy. To imagine improving upon the current soap base is almost unfathomable. Excelsior achieves the task and proves that even the very best can still be better. Excelsior utilizes the following ingredients:Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Milk, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Methyl Gluceth-10, Xanthan Gum, Sucrose Cocoate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Allantoin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lanolin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Fragrance, Sodium Ricinoleate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate.  Excelsior is firmer than Barrister's Reserve by a wide margin, although the soap loads very easily into your brush of choice regardless of fiber type. While the soap handles hydration and even overhydration with the most thirsty soaps, overhydration is not warranted. The lather build effortlessly and it presents itself with the consistency of elmer's glue when dialed in. This low structure lather is my current favorite type of lather. While it lacks voluminous peaks, it is very dense and protective. The slickness is as expected, oil on glass slickness with residual slickness for days. The post shave is luxurious and leaves the skin both hydrated, protected and feeling supple. The entire experience with this soap base screams luxury. In a crowded space of elite level luxury soap bases, Excelsior stands alone at the top. Given the improvements in ease of lather, lather density coupled with the elite slickness and post shave, Excelsior receives a shavescore of 98. Soap bases with similar performance are Talbot Shaving and Declaration Grooming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Barrister and Mann Vespers (purchased)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Ghost” (purchased)\n* Razor - Dovo Bismarck (gift)\n* Post - Barrister and Mann Vespers (purchased)",

Clusterfig flanks the ever popular Leviathan release, which occurs each Fall season. The goal was to deliver a true fig scent to the wet shaving hobby market in a way that only Barrister and Mann can. Barrister and Mann products can be purchased direct from their site and from third party stockists such as: Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nClusterfig features notes of; Amber, Fig, Lemon, Apple, Violet, Orange Blossom and Jasmine. The fragrance, while complex is fig forward as intended. The scent is sweet and floral but not in a heavy way. The bright green fig opens the accord before sweet apple and tart lemon hit the nose. The floral notes move in and wrap themselves around the sweetness in a mastery of olfactory perception. Mrs. Ruds is not a fan of this scent, but that is no surprise given her distaste for floral scents. This has a mid-strong strength of scent off the sample and remains this way once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Ariana & Evans Summer Fig as a comparable scent profile.  \n\nBarrister and Mann Excelsior is a tallow soap that utilizes the following ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Milk, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Methyl Gluceth-10, Xanthan Gum, Sucrose Cocoate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Allantoin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lanolin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Fragrance, Sodium Ricinoleate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate. The soap is on the firmer side of mid and loads very easily into your brush of choice regardless of fiber type. While the soap handles hydration and even overhydration with the most thirsty soaps, overhydration is not warranted. The lather builds effortlessly and it presents itself with the consistency of elmer's glue when dialed in. While it lacks voluminous peaks, it is very dense and protective. The slickness is as expected, oil on glass slickness with residual slickness for days. The post shave is luxurious and leaves the skin both hydrated, protected and feeling supple. The entire experience with this soap base screams luxury. In a crowded space of elite level luxury soap bases, Excelsior stands alone at the top. Excelsior receives a ShaveScore of 98. Soap bases with similar performance are Talbot Shaving and Ariana and Evans.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Barrister and Mann Clusterfig (purchased)\n* Brush - Ever Ready 200 w/ 24mm Maggard SHD (gift)\n* Razor - Dovo “Best Quality” (gift)\n* Post - Fine Accoutrements Fresh Vetiver (purchased)",

Why the heck would I want a sunscreen so high up in my essence/toner? According to new reviews it stinks.\n\nIt seems like a widespread strategy to create a great product, rack up great reviews, and then quietly change the formula to make it cheaper to produce and hope nobody notices. It's also happened to Sulwhasoo's Overnight Vitalizing Mask - there's essentially no ginseng in this product anymore (it's shunted wayyyy down in the ingredients list). Unfortunately I purchased it before realizing, at fiddysnail's recommendation.\n\nWhat products have betrayed you in this way?",

This one man band is based out of Morenci, MI and is highly passionate about every single aspect of running this successful small business.

The scent is complex and includes notes of: Oakmoss, Cardamom, Galbanum, Yuzu, Treemoss, Cedar and Spices. This fragrance is nicely blended and individual notes are quite hard to discern from the accord. It is sweet, but not cloying and warm with a touch of spice. The scent is ideal for the current cold winter in the Northeastern U.S.A. but I do feel like this can be multi seasonal because it opens sweet and is bright enough to stand the warmer climate types. I would also contend this is a multi occasion user, like casually and in a professional setting. Scent strength on this is mid-strong off the container and remains this way through the entire shave. This scent is quite unique but Grooming Dept Mallard Chai shares a similar vibe.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeclaration’s Icarus soap base is truly amazing. This base is immediately in the driver seat as a contender to be a consensus favorite performing soap base. This soap base is firm and care must be taking to load the brush. The base demands to be fed water. When properly dialed in, the lather is both voluminous and dense, similar to sour cream with a radiant sheen. The slickness of this soap base, including residual slickness is elite level. The post shave is also absolutely elite and among the most luxurious post shave feelings available. The ingredients in the soap base are:  Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Mango Seed Butter, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Bison Tallow, Lamb Tallow, Colloidal Oatmeal, Goat's Milk, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Salix Alba L.

I used their conditioner as well, and for a while, it made my hair nice and soft.  \n\nThen all of a sudden, my hair started to get extremely dry and tangled all the time. I am talking self dread locking, small animal around the nape of my neck tangled.  I first chalked it up to being winter and my jacket/scarf being the culprit, but as we moved into and through summer, same problem.\n\nI started changing conditioners, trying different ones, but nothing seemed to help.  I tried protien treatments and that seemed to help. Then I realized, it was not the protien treatment that was helping but the aphogee shampoo for damaged hair which had SLS in it. \n\n I have been experimenting with this theory and it appears that whenever I shampoo with the aphogee and my regular conditioner its fine.  If I use the SLS free shampoos I have, tangled, dry mess. I am thinking that the more natural shampoos just dont cut it (literally), I think there is junk left on my hair, which means that the moisture from my conditioner isn't penetrating in there and also that junk likes to stick to junk, causing tangling.\n\nIs there any rhyme to my reason or am I totally off base here?

    "body": "Hello, new to this community. I recently messed up my skin barrier and was developing some fungal acne. My skin had lots of redness, itching, rough bumpy texture, and a dry yet oily/waxy feeling. These products helped me out a bit. I searched the ingredients through sezia and found 2 of the products where completely safe. The rest contained 1 “possible” trigger. Posted this here in case someone was looking for other options/safe products. Of course, skincare is individual, and not one size fits all. But, hopefully this helps someone. \n\n1. Briotech Topical skin spray (100% safe)- $14. It’s a hypochlorous acid spray. Hypochlorous acid is electrolyzed water. It smells slightly of chlorine while wet/liquid, once dry it turns to salt water. Non-toxic, or irritating. It’s what’s added to tap water to make sure it’s safe for drinking. It’s a good disinfectant on surfaces. As well as being skin safe and eye safe. It’s prescribed to treat certain eye conditions such as pink eye, helps heal styes, and eliminate eyelash mites. It’s also great for eczema and psoriasis prone skin, because it helps kill irritating skin mites. Helps promote wound healing etc...All in all a great gentle product for helping keep bacteria at bay on the skin, without further compromising your skins moisture barrier. I like to mist it on my face throughout the day, and on my face mask to kill bacteria. Doesn’t sting or burn. \n\n2. Prosacea rosacea gel-$10 (100% safe). Ingredients: 10% sulfur, Acrylates, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Diazolidinyl Urea, Lactose, Methylparaben, Propylene Glycol, Propylparaben, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water. *Nice sulfur option in a gentle base. \n\n3. La roche posay effaclar gel cleanser $14- it’s a zinc pca based face wash that’s a less drying alternative to zinc shampoos and nizoral. Formulated with a 5.5 ph for the face. Sezia flagged 1 ingredient for being a possible trigger, while folliculitisscout said it was safe. I’ve always had luck with this wash helping my skin recover from fungal acne. They flagged the peg-120 which is a surfactant and emulsifier. *Ingredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE, PEG-8, COCO-BETAINE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PEG-120 METHYL GLUCOSE DIOLEATE, ZINC PCA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CITRIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PARFUM / FRAGRANCE\n\n4. Zapzyt acne wash $5- 2% salicylic acid cleanser. This feels so gentle and soothing compared to other acne cleansers. *Ingredients: Purified Water, Disodium EDTA, Chamomile Extract, Aloe Vera Gel, Bioterge AS-40, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glucamate DOE-120, Glydate, Sodium Chloride. Folliculitisscout says it’s safe, while sezia flagged 1 ingredient: glutamate doe-120, which is a plant derived thickener, and helps reduce irritation from certain surfactants. \n\n5. Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel- lightweight moisturizer, more hydrating than sebamed gel. I like to add some squalane when I need a bit more moisture.

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/caHehNWCwQo)\n\nBarrister and Mann ([https://www.barristerandmann.com/](https://www.barristerandmann.com/)) made Black Friday 2019 extra special with an extremely limited release of their modified Excelsior base, known in the testing phase as “PP-8”. The release is known as the Soft Heart Series and featured fragrance releases of Le Petit Chypre and Tiaga, both formerly of the Latha line from Barrister and Mann. Barrister and Mann products can be purchased direct from their site and from third party stockists such as: Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nLe Petit Chypre is a softer chypre than the acclaimed Le Grande Chypre that Barrister and Mann produces. Featuring notes of; bergamot, lavender, petitgrain, ylang ylang, oakmoss, labdanum, patchouli, cedar, and tonka, this fragrance is rich and elegant. The fragrance opens with a soft citrus top and displays a middle tone of resin and a base of mossy, musky oakmoss. Make no mistake, this is masculine and deeply rich. Mrs. Ruds loves the chypre genre and Le Petit Chypre gets her full approval for any occasion. Strength of scent is strong off the container and remains this strength once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Catie's Bubbles Mille Chypre as a similar scent profile.\n\nThe Soft Heart Series is offered in a limited edition base, a variant of BaM’s Excelsior base known as “PP-8”. I had the absolute pleasure of testing PP-8 last November (2018) prior to the release of Excelsior. While the ingredients are the same with PP-8 and Excelsior, the lather is very different. PP-8 lists the following ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Milk, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Methyl Gluceth-10, Xanthan Gum, Sucrose Cocoate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Allantoin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lanolin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Fragrance, Sodium Ricinoleate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate. It is of mid firmness on the firmness spectrum and is a very thirsty soap. As you properly hydrate and agitate the lather, you should arrive at a lather with the consistency of elmer’s glue. The slickness of this lather is silly, it is almost too fast. Both primary and residual slickness are among the elite. PP-8 has a post shave that is even better for my money than Excelsior, which is no slouch. The soft silky feeling provided by this post shave matches just about anything that comes to mind. Given the metrics discussed and my experience with the Barrister and Mann PP-8 soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 100. For similar performance in a soap base I suggest; Declaration Grooming Milksteak or Wholly Kaw Siero.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Barrister and Mann Soft Heart Series Le Petit Chypre (loaner)\n* Brush - Semogue TSN LE (loaner)\n* Razor - Wade & Butcher “Buffalo” (gift)\n* Post - Barrister’s Reserve Classic (purchased)",

Terror aims to replace the long time summer seasonal, Arctique. Barrister and Mann kept the cooling theme for this summer seasonal, but enhanced the scent with additional notes and by using a synthetic cooling agent rather than traditional menthol additive. Terror will be available for purchase until August 31, 2019.  Barrister and Mann products can be purchased direct from their site and from third party stockists such as: Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nBarrister and Mann Terror is named for the Royal Navy warship, turned polar exploration vessel, that was lost to the Arctic in 1848. As the name indicates, this soap is extremely cold, featuring notes of: Synthetic Menthol, Frankincense, Salt Water and Peppermint. The scent opens with a chilling blast of cold peppermint before notes of frankincense and salt water provide a backbone to withstand the coldness. The scent is approachable and fun, not overly complex or overly msaculine. Mrs. Ruds doesn’t care for this scent, which is no surprise these days. Strength of scent is strong both off the sample and once the soap has been lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Barrister and Mann Arctique and Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Frost Byte as comparable scent profiles.   \n\nBarrister and Mann Excelsior is a tallow soap that utilizes the following ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Milk, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Methyl Gluceth-10, Xanthan Gum, Sucrose Cocoate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Allantoin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lanolin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Fragrance, Sodium Ricinoleate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate. The soap is on the firmer side of mid and loads very easily into your brush of choice regardless of fiber type. While the soap handles hydration and even overhydration with the most thirsty soaps, overhydration is not warranted. The lather builds effortlessly and it presents itself with the consistency of elmer's glue when dialed in. While it lacks voluminous peaks, it is very dense and protective. The slickness is as expected, oil on glass slickness with residual slickness for days. The post shave is luxurious and leaves the skin both hydrated, protected and feeling supple. The entire experience with this soap base screams luxury. In a crowded space of elite level luxury soap bases, Excelsior stands alone at the top. Excelsior receives a ShaveScore of 98. Soap bases with similar performance are Talbot Shaving and Ariana and Evans.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Barrister and Mann Terror (PIF)\n* Brush - Declaration Grooming Jefferson Unicorn Ivory (loaner)\n* Razor - Karve Shaving Co.

The recipe I used is\n\n\n\nHEATED PHASE\n\n30% BTMS-50 \n\n20% Cetyl alcohol \n\n29.4% cocoa butter \n\n4% jojoba oil\n\n\n\nWATER/COOLDOWN PHASE\n\n10% Sodium cocoamphoacetate \n\n0.1% tetrasodium EDTA \n\n0.5% mixed tocopherols \n\n0.5% liquid germall plus \n\n4% daikon seed extract \n\n1% panthenol \n\n1.5% fragrance oil\n\n\nI melted down my heated phase and thatbwas fine. Took really long but I expected that. When I was measuring out my cooldown/water phase, I accidentally added my EDTA to the beaker with my preservative, vitamin e, daikon seed extract, panthenol, pretty much everything but my surfactant. I was like WHY WONT THIS DISSOLVE and then I remembered the EDTA was supposed to go in the beaker with my SCA. So because i didn't want to risk there being any EDTA crystals in my final product, i mixed everything together. Once my heated phase was melted, i waited for it to cool to 115F. I stirred and checked the temperature constantly. Liquid germall plus can be added when formulations are cooler than 122, but I didn't want to risk it so I waited a bit longer. Upon adding everything, my mix seized up a bit, but I kept stirring and the residual heat made everything uniform again. I poured it into my mold and let it set for a few hours. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/vWHgnnN\n\n\n\nmy last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/im7ki5/i_want_to_make_a_simple_cowash_bar_how_does_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",

That means its time for another PIF.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/hritjp6](https://imgur.com/a/hritjp6)\n\nFor grabs is a 4oz tin of my lastest batch. Scent dominated by Juniper, with hints of Clary Sage, Warm Woods, and Patchouli, it reminded me of some time I spent in Sedona, AZ. A high desert smell with a dose of hippie.\n\nThis batch omits the beer and mead in the Kitchen Sink formula, but adds a bit more NaOH to the lye ratio, and introduces a little Sodium Lactate (a hardener), Tetrasodium EDTA (a chelation agent to improve performance in hard water), and Titanium Dioxide (to give it a creamy whiteness and possible secondary use as a stylish sunblock\\*). The result was, well, weird. The consistency is a bit like a thick putty, but after using it for a week, I can say that it makes for a prodigious lather. Frankly, I quite like it.\n\n(For what is it worth, I'm throwing in a 1oz tin of SEDONA with the next three orders of Kitchen Sink placed on our square site.)\n\nThis PIF is open to all in the USA. International are welcome, but I'll cover just the first $5 of postage. The rest is on you.\n\nLatherbot lottery 50 24\n\n\\*Do NOT use it as a sunblock. That would be foolish.",

This one man band is based out of Morenci, MI and is highly passionate about every single aspect of running this successful small business. This scent is a collaboration project undertaken with TryThatSoap ([https://trythatsoap.com](https://trythatsoap.com/)/). Declaration Grooming is available for purchase direct from their website and also stockists such as Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)), West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)), Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)) and The Stray Whisker ([https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/](https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/)). Big thanks to @bravoure (u/Tonality) for letting me borrow this set.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTry That Soap 2.0 stays true to its roots by utilizing Try That Soap shave of the day archives to come up with a blend of popular scent notes. The fragrance consists of notes of: Blood Orange, Black Amber, Fern, Petitgrain, Pineapple, Cedar and Galbanum. The scent is sweet upon the opening and becomes somewhat earthy as it dries down. It is hard to discern individual notes, but the overall scent is pleasant and safe. Mrs. Ruds does not care for the scent, likely because of the earth notes. Scent strength is mid out of the soap jar and remains mid for the shave’s duration. There is really nothing similar to this in wet shaving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeclaration’s Icarus soap base is truly amazing. This base is immediately in the driver seat as a contender to be a consensus favorite performing soap base. This soap base is firm and care must be taking to load the brush. The base demands to be fed water. When properly dialed in, the lather is both voluminous and dense, similar to sour cream with a radiant sheen. The slickness of this soap base, including residual slickness is elite level. The post shave is also absolutely elite and among the most luxurious post shave feelings available. The ingredients in the soap base are:  Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Mango Seed Butter, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Bison Tallow, Lamb Tallow, Colloidal Oatmeal, Goat's Milk, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tussah Silk. The ShaveScore for Icarus is a 96. Given this rating this soap base performs similarly to both Ariana & Evans and Wholly Kaw Bufala.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Declaration Grooming Try That Soap 2.0 (loaner)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Tusk” (purchased)\n* Razor - Colonial Razors Silversmith (loaner)\n* Post - Declaration Grooming Try That Soap 2.0 (loaner)",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/4-9OkAxAp8Q)\n\nBarrister and Mann ([https://www.barristerandmann.com/](https://www.barristerandmann.com/)) released their third offering in the extremely limited Soft Heart Series on January 16, 2020. Because only 80 soaps and 70 aftershave bottles were available, you’ll be relegated to scouring the buy, sell & trade forums in order to acquire this offering. Standard Barrister and Mann products can be purchased direct from their site and from third party stockists such as: Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nAmazelnut is an elegant gourmand fragrance which features notes of; hazelnut, vetiver and vanilla. For users with nut allergies, Barrister and Mann assures that there is actually no hazelnut materials in this fragrance. The fragrance opens with rich hazelnut which is sweetened a bit by vanilla and rounded out by the woodiness of vetiver. In truth, this fragrance smells like Nutella, a popular hazelnut spread here in the United States. Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this fragrance. This is normal for gourmand style wears. She is okay with me wearing the scent casually. Strength of scent is strong off the puck and remains strong for the lather and shave process. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Catie's Bubbles Irish Coffee as a similar scent profile. \n\nThe Soft Heart Series is offered in a limited edition base, a variant of BaM’s Excelsior base known as “PP-8”. I had the absolute pleasure of testing PP-8 last November (2018) prior to the release of Excelsior. While the ingredients are the same with PP-8 and Excelsior, the lather is very different. PP-8 lists the following ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Milk, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Methyl Gluceth-10, Xanthan Gum, Sucrose Cocoate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Allantoin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lanolin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Fragrance, Sodium Ricinoleate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate. It is of mid firmness on the firmness spectrum and is a very thirsty soap. As you properly hydrate and agitate the lather, you should arrive at a lather with the consistency of elmer’s glue. The slickness of this lather is silly, it is almost too fast. Both primary and residual slickness are among the elite. PP-8 has a post shave that is even better for my money than Excelsior, which is no slouch. The soft silky feeling provided by this post shave matches just about anything that comes to mind. Given the metrics discussed and my experience with the Barrister and Mann PP-8 soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 100. For similar performance in a soap base I suggest; Declaration Grooming Milksteak or Wholly Kaw Siero.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Barrister and Mann Soft Heart Series Amazelnut (loaner)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Tusk” (purchased)\n* Razor - Razorock Lupo SS (purchased)\n* Post - Barrister and Mann Soft Heart Series Amazelnut (loaner)",

(https://groomatorium.com/) recently release a new line of soaps and aftershaves to compliment their Chiseled Face line as well as their production of the new LA Shaving Soap and Tiki Bar Soaps. This soap line up is called Stubble Buster (https://stubblebuster.com/). The company aims to offering familiar scents with soap that performs amazingly at a very low cost. Soaps are all USD $8.99 for 4 oz of soap and the aftershave line up is USD $9.99 for 3.4 oz. The site offers free shipping on orders over USD $20.00. That represents an amazing deal in the wet shaving space.\n\nBurnish is a citrus forward scent compliments by familiar earth tones. The scent notes are listed as: lemon, neroli, pineapple, rosemary, bergamot, cyclamen, coriander, jasmine, oakmoss, sandalwood, tonka bean, musk, oakmoss, cedar, brazilian rosewood and cardamom. For me, the scent opens with bergamot and lemon, but they are not overly sharp. The scent becomes rounded by the powdery oakmoss and creamy sandalwood. I detect some woodiness and some smokiness, likely from the cedar. Scent strength off the container is mid and remains unchanged during the lather and shave. Similar scented soap recommendations are: Bufflehead Soap Co. Tishomingo or Oleo Soapworks Fiera.\n\nStubble Buster utilizes a tallow based soap formula. The soap ~~is very soft~~  is softer than Chiseled Face's formula by design and it loads into any knot type with little to no effort. The soap is not thirsty, a little water goes a long way with this one. The dialed in lather is reminiscent of whipped cream. This is one crazy creamy lather with both density and volume. The slickness on this soap is very good, both primary slickness and residual slickness. The post shave is also good. Ingredients are listed as: Potassium Tallowate, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Potassium Soybeanate, Petrolatum, Aqua, Sodium Lactate, Potassium Olivate, Fragrance, Bentonite Clay, Cera Alba (beeswax), Tetrasodium EDTA. I cannot think of a soap that performs this well at this price point. This is truly a soap that punches well above, its price point. The shavescore for this Stubble Buster soap base is an 88. This puts the soap in the class of soaps such as Storybook Soapworks and Summer Break Soaps.   \n\n---\n**Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap -  ​Stubble Buster Burnish (purchased)\n\n* Brush - ​​Wolf Whiskers RCE#43 Juliet (purchased)\n\n* Razor - ​​Filarmonica 13 \"Sub Cero\" (PIF)\n\n* Post - Chiseled Face Natural (purchased) \n",

Gonna try that first.**\n\nI have a waist-length naturally blonde never-dyed hair. It has been turning brassier, so I figured Vit C might help, since it removes mineral buildup. And it did help, getting rid of almost all buildup, except for this damn orange. I live in an area with pretty high amount of iron in water.\n\nSo every time it goes like this: I do an ascorbic acid treatment and the whole bathroom smells like iron. So obviously, it's reacting. When I rinse it out and blow-dry my hair, it's very blonde, my natural color. But for some reason, a few days after washing, it turns orange.\n\nSo far, I have figured that what happens is that vit C reduces the iron atoms and so they turn colorless. And then, after some time, they oxidize again, thus turning reddish. So I am getting the iron to reduce but not getting the reduced iron atoms out of hair! It is not natural orange/red pigments in hair since my hair grows almost platinum blonde and the hair smells horribly like iron almost all the time when it's wet. I've purchased a shower filter but haven't yet seen the difference. I also tried Color Wow Pre-Shampoo Filter but it didn't do anything for me.\n\n**How could I get the reduced iron atoms out of hair better (after using vit C) or could prevent the oxidation to keep the hair color my natural blonde?** I have mixed the vit C with chelating shampoo, used a blowdryer for 15 mins with a cap with holes in it and then washed it out with chelating shampoo again.\n\nAny suggestions would be very helpful!",

    "body": "**Stridex Maximum Pads**\n\nYes, you read that correctly…I am here before you today to review Stridex Pads LOL! Hear me out…\n\nI was browsing Amazon a few months ago looking at their top selling/most popular skincare products and Stridex popped up pretty high on the list.\n\nInitially, I passed over them with a nice long eye roll…but decided to click through and actually read the ingredients list.\n\nMy use of Stridex Pads stopped sometime in high school in favor of Proactiv and I hadn’t really thought about then since then.\n\nSurprisingly, the ingredients list didn’t look as scary as I had imagined.\n\n2% Salicylic Acid plus some preservatives, fragrance, and texturizes. All in all..not that bad.\n\nSo, I took the plunge and decided to give this retro product (at least for me) another go. My results have been kind of shocking to be honest.\n\nThe pads are soaked in a lightweight fluid that applies to skin nicely and soaks in rather quickly.\n\nAlthough I am not a fan of the slight “foaming” that happens upon application or the menthol based/“medicinal” scent…both dissipate rather quickly and aren’t a huge issue (for me).\n\nOnce applied, I tend to let the fluid sit for a couple of minutes before moving on to my toner, essence, so on and so on.\n\nOver the past month my skin has really seemed to appreciate these pads. Blemishes seem to be minimized both in size and frequency and clogged pores are less apparent as well.\n\nThe Stridex Maximum Pads have been a great accompaniment to my Curology prescription since that contains Azaleic Acid (aka AHA). Having a separate BHA-only product rounds out my chemical exfoliation step and I’ve had no issue using the duo on a daily basis.\n\nDon’t get me wrong…I would love to use an AHA/BHA toner to skip the extra step. But, I worry that adding another AHA like Glycolic Acid may be too much for my skin at this time (or at least one with a high concentration of AHA).\n\nI’m not a fan of the one time use cotton pads due to the additional waste...so I’ll most likely be passing on a repurchase of this product in favor of a BHA only toner I can use with reusable cotton pads (given I can find one LOL).\n\nBut for those looking for a super affordable, easy to obtain, and relatively straightforward BHA fluid…I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t point to the Stridex Maximum Pads as a potential option.\n\nNever thought I’d be saying that LOL!\n\nFull Ingrediens List:   \n \n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic Acid (2%) ((w/w))\n\nInactive Ingredients: Amino Methyl Propanol, Ammonium Xylene Sulfonate, Citric Acid, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance, Menthol, PPG 5 Ceteth 20, Water (Purified), Simethicone, Sodium Borate, Tetrasodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Amazon - $7.00 USD): [https://www.amazon.com/Stridex-Strength-Medicated-Maximum-Count/dp/B000O1KP1O/ref=sr\\_1\\_2?crid=LX1DRG258I7V&dchild=1&keywords=stridex+acne+pads&qid=1594676853&sprefix=strides+%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/Stridex-Strength-Medicated-Maximum-Count/dp/B000O1KP1O/ref=sr_1_2?crid=LX1DRG258I7V&dchild=1&keywords=stridex+acne+pads&qid=1594676853&sprefix=strides+%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-2) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gr65u4jcua51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3259a05ca51f71ff4c1794812515b6f12ace02f",

(https://groomatorium.com/) recently release a new line of soaps and aftershaves to compliment their Chiseled Face line as well as their production of the new LA Shaving Soap and Tiki Bar Soaps. This soap line up is called Stubble Buster (https://stubblebuster.com/). The company is offering familiar cologne scents with soap that performs amazingly at a very low cost. Soaps are all USD $8.99 for 4 oz of soap and the aftershave line up is USD $9.99 for 3.4 oz. The aftershave is intense and can easily be worn as a cologne for the budget conscious amongst us. The site offers free shipping on orders over USD $20.00. That represents an amazing deal in the wet shaving space.\n\nCoastal is a clone of the very popular L'Eau d'Issey Pour Homme by Issey Miyake. Described as a woody aquatic, this scent features notes of yuzu, bergamot, lemon, tarragon, nutmeg, water lily, amber, tobacco, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, and musk. This accord is complex but to my nose, it opens spicy and woody with a floral background. The citrusy kick comes next before a soft creamy finish. Those that enjoy the fragrance this scent is cloned from will ultimately enjoy this a lot I imagine. While this scent feels perfect for warm summer days, I do feel like I could rock it all year long. Scent strength off the container is mid-strong and remains unchanged during the lather and shave. \n\nStubble Buster utilizes a tallow based soap formula. The soap is very soft by design and it loads into any knot type with little to no effort. The soap is not thirsty, a little water goes a long way with this one. The dialed in lather is reminiscent of whipped cream. This is one crazy creamy lather with both density and volume. The slickness on this soap is very good, both primary slickness and residual slickness. The post shave is also good. Ingredients are listed as: Potassium Tallowate, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Potassium Soybeanate, Petrolatum, Aqua, Sodium Lactate, Potassium Olivate, Fragrance, Bentonite Clay, Cera Alba (beeswax), Tetrasodium EDTA. I cannot think of a soap that performs this well at this price point. This is truly a soap that punches well above, its price point. The shavescore for this Stubble Buster soap base is an 88. This puts the soap in the class of soaps such as Storybook Soapworks and Summer Break Soaps.   \n\n---  \n\n**Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap -  ​Stubble Buster Coastal (purchased)\n\n* Brush - ​​Turn-N-Shave \"Ghost\" (promotional gift)\n\n* Razor - ​​Karve Shaving Co. \"The Christopher Bradley\" (loaner)\n\n* Post - Stubble Buster Coastal (purchased)\n",

So, let me tell you a little story about my dandruff struggles. For the past three years, I have been dealing with a flaky scalp (not much itchy) that just would not quit. I tried all kinds of shampoos and treatments, but nothing seemed to work and remember Oiling won't help with Dandruff either.\n\nObviously went to derma too where she recommended loads of prescribed shite with Ketoconazole ,Coal tar, Pyrithione zinc ,salisalic acid etc .There was a point 🥲where she even wrote dutasteride for the hairfalls caused by dandruff,still mystery why she wrote that for 3 months without any blood work .Ditched her obviously.\n\nAfter wasting my money and time for 3 years .i came across to a mid lev shampoo called \"Truefrog anti dandruff\" which worked for keeping dandruff at bay for a week or less.. but yea used it for a year only drawback was dry hair🥲and scalp.(honourable mention though)\n\nThen while searching for shampoo i came across to this Neutrogena T/Gel. I thought _itna paisa uda hi diya hai ,ye bhi kar lete hain_ .\nAnd let me tell you, I am SO glad I did! This stuff is a game-changer. The coal tar has seriously worked wonders on my dandruff, and my scalp hasn't felt this calm and itch-free/flake free in years. \n\n**Smell** : The shampoo smells weird ,feels like Ramdev baba ki jadibuti kisi ne dal di hai.If patanjali ever make any actual ayurvedic shampoo with natural ingredients they'll probably smell like this. like someone just mashed up a bunch of eucalyptus leaves and bottled it.\n\n\n**Consistency** : The shampoo is a little weird - it's thick and jelly-like, which takes some getting used to. Not very foamy . Although takes care of my hair pretty well ,like 1 squeeze is enough. \n\n**ingredients**: Coal Tar Extract 20 mg/ml. ingredient is: NeutarTM Solubilised The active on the top of the carton.\n\nsodium chloride and purified sodium laury lether sulfate, cocodiethanolamide, esters of benzoic acid, benzyl E216, tetrasodium EDTA, citre acid anhydrous, cocamidopropyl betaine, imidazolidiny urea, E218 (Other ingredients lauryl ether (4). are: Macrogol perfume (contains benzoate and E321), water\n\n**Experience** : using it from last 2 months . Twice a week ( or atleast i try ) with Reequil murumuru Damage repair conditioner(Ordered them both and using them together from last 2 months ). The flaking is zero now. Feels like dandruff is gone. Totally recommend 🤌✨ for the price . I think it'll last easily around 10 months or more( I'm a guy with short hairs) . The price to perfomance is good. Atleast Better  than what derma recommended.\n\n**Cons** : \n1.One thing I do wish was different is that the bottle doesn't have an authentication mark. I mean when i got it ,it has no seal or anything. The packaging was just nothing. A box and inside it a bottle. Pour and use. That's it .not even a  tape bruh. Ordered from Amazon ,mine was in a good shape . Bottle and box was fine but again NO AUTHENTICATION. better choose the seller with good reviews.\n\n2. It takes 5-6mins to let it sit and then wash and it's so annoying 🥲to wait and again put conditioner and then wait again. In between there's actual bathing is also happening.idk it takes my 20-30min in the bathroom despite having short hair and going rogue.\n\n3. This thing is pretty drying without any conditioner and can damage your hair . And due to coaltar u have to wear cap to protect your scalp.\n\n\nOverall, I am thrilled with this shampoo and would recommend it to anyone dealing with dandruff. It has made a HUGE difference in my life - no more flaking, no more itching at just RS 1kish.",

I was wondering if there was a cheaper shampoo out there that had similar ingredients/properties/etc. I know that it contains a \"patented Healthy Hair Molecule (OFPMA)\" so it may be difficult to find something close enough. \n\n**Some Background Info:**\n\nI have fine/thin shoulder length virgin (undyed) hair. I don't use any styling products or tools. I typically shampoo every two days, air dry, detangle with a wide tooth comb when dry, and wear up in a loose messy bun most of the time. I don't use conditioner.\n\nMy current apartment has very hard water, and I don't have the option of installing a water softener or anything like that. \n\nSulfate free or low sulfate shampoos don't clean my scap well enough, and shampoos with SLS or SLES tend to irritate my scalp and cause increased hair fallout. \n\nLiving Proof shampoo is the only one I've found that cleans well, does not strip or dry my hair, and leaves my scalp happy. It's just lovely silky hair and a balanced scalp. I am not knowledgeable enough, however, to figure out why!\n\n**The ingredients list is here:** \n\n*Water/Eau/Aqua, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Octafluoropentyl Methacrylate (OFPMA), PCA Glyceryl Oleate, Behenyl Alcohol, PEG-150 Pentaerithrityl Tetrastearate, IPDI/PEG-15 Soyamine Copolymer Dimer Dilinoleate, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleammonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-47, Laureth-4, Laureth-23, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Fragrance/Parfum, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Magnesium Nitrate, Magnesium Chloride.*",

I think my top budget recommendations would be either Batiste or Dove Beauty.\n\nIf you're interested in attempting to DIY it, I've also used cornstarch with cinnamon and cocoa added (for color since I'm a brunette) and it works super well. It might leave more build up on your scalp than you want, but on days when I know I'm stretching it but don't want to wash, it gets rid of oiliness incredibly well and leaves my hair feeling pretty clean.",

Previously I was using the no7 protect and perfect daycreams, because they had spf15 in and 5 star UVA protection. In comparison to this suncream though, they barely did anything to noticeably improve my skin. \n\nAs far as application goes, I find it moisturising but not too greasy (haven't had any trouble with it breaking me out).

The ShaveScore system will continue to be utilized recognizing that in general most creams do not have the superior post shave that our artisan soap makers yield in their luxurious bases. As such, the scores will likely be lower. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nArt of Shaving ([https://www.theartofshaving.com/](https://www.theartofshaving.com/)), a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble, offers shaving creams, pre shave oil, hardware and post shave. Art of Shaving offers a bridge between modern shaving and the enthusiast wet shaver. Many wet shavers start with AOS products before finding the artisan market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArt of Shaving Oud is a deep rich scent that uses “Oud essence” and is inspired by AOS Oud Suede Cologne Intense. This fragrance is a masculine aromatic and woody aroma. I really enjoy this interpretation of oud as it is toned down and less offensive than other oud offerings that I’ve smelled. Despite the palatability of this, it is still not Mrs. Ruds approved. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the sample and remains this way through the entire shave. Similar scents from wet shaving are:  Wholly Kaw King of Oud and \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAOS Oud cream is made from: Water/Aqua, Palmitic Acid, Myristic Acid, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Acid, Glycerin, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hydroxide, Lauric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Tetrasodium Edta, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone. As with most creams, I use about an almond size amount that will yield enough lather for a three pass shave. Using a damp but not soaking wet brush and the slow addition of water will make plenty of lather which will look like sour cream. The primary slickness of this cream is excellent and residual slickness is very good, not as good as with lather visible, but still adequate to have no fear of cutting oneself. Post shave is average at best. A post shave product is necessary to hydrate and protect the skin. The ShaveScore for Art of Shaving Oud is a 78. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***  \n\n\n* Soap - Art of Shaving Oud (PIF)\n* Brush - Simpsons Chubby 2 “Best Badger” (gift)\n* Razor - Rex Supply Co.

From what I understand, chelating ingredients bind metal ions so they can remove minerals built up on the hair from hard water and chlorine. So, can you use chelating shampoo as a swimmer’s shampoo? Are there certain chelating ingredients for certain ions or do they all do the same thing? Related, if something isn’t marketed as a chelating product but contains chelating ingredients (e.g., Tresseme Cleanse & Replenish), is it still useful for that purpose? \n\nLast question! As far as clarifying goes, are those just really strong shampoos or do they remove things that regular shampoo can’t? \n\nI’m basically wondering whether I can avoid buying swimmer’s shampoo and go for a cheaper Tresseme product with citric acid and tetrasodium EDTA\n\nThank you!!",

And claims that it has been linked to hair loss, allergic reactions, and cancer.\n\nI am just curious if this is really a problem ingredient or are people blowing these out of proportion.\n\nAccording to the ecoco website:\n> Below, you will find a list of ingredients and a brief explanation of their benefits.  If you have any further questions please email us at info@ecocoinc.com.\n> \n> CARMOMER - This non-toxic emulsifier helps to increase thickness and consistency of good hair gel.\n> \n> **TEA (Triethanolamine)* - an alkaline substance used as a  PH adjuster.  It is an organic compound that is FDA approved.  We use the lowest produced dose of TEA (Lower concentration version) and of that less than 1% goes into our hair gel.  That tiny percentage is essential for ensuring smooth application and consistent PH levels.**\n> \n> Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein- Hydrates and improves moisture content of hair.  NON-ANIMAL derived source. Provides amino acids to skin, hair and scalp.\n> \n> PVP - Water soluble binding agent. FDA approved for use as clarifying agent in beer & wine as well.\n> \n> Glycerin - Vegetable based compound containing many good lipids that soften hair.\n> \n> Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate - Derived from a naturally occurring amino acid this acts as a great hair conditioner and provides a natural alternative to parabens.\n> \n> Polysorbate 20 - This is a solubilizer for fragrance that also adds soothing effects on the skin.  Derived from fruits and berries.\n> \n> Tetrasodium EDTA – This water soluble ingredient is used     to help neutralize ions and prevent microbial growth. Derived from glycerin, this is commonly used in food items as well.\n> \n> **\\*TEA can indeed contain nitrosamines which are known to be carcinogenic. However, cosmetic grade TEA from Dow Chemical Co. has previously been analyzed independently and there was no detectable nitrosamine across several batches (J Soc Cosmet Chem, pp 237-252, 1980). The word 'detectable' is important because the instruments used can find nitrosamines if there is even one nanogram (1 billionth of a gram) present......yes really that little! Therefore if this type of cosmetic grade TEA is used for the gel, it will have no detectable amounts of nitrosamine.**",

It's a yellowish fluid consistency and it doesn't look very shiny, mostly natural, but I usually put some translucent powder over it because it can get greasy if it's hot outside. \n\nIt leaves a bit of a white cast in the beginning, but it disappears after a few minutes. The downside is that it does pill on reapplication or if you touch it throughout the day. But since I usually don't reapply for everyday wear it works well. I don't like that it turns a little white when in contact with water, but again for everyday wear I don't mind it.\n\nIt smells like cherries/almonds, which I like. It's not strong and disappears quickly. All in all I think it's very pleasant to use and I'd get it again. It doesn't break me out and it's mostly fungal acne safe.\n\nI also just got the bigger body version, which seems very similar, but I haven't tried it out yet.\n\nHeliocare advanced gel SPF50 \n\nInci: Aqua, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, PEG/PPG-20/6 Dimethicone, Glycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Zinc Oxide (Nano), Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyacrylamide, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polypodium Leucotomos Leaf Extract, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Phenoxyethanol, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Laureth-7, Cetyl Dimethicone, Camellia Sinensis Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dichlorobenzyl Alcohol, Plankton Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Alumina, BHT, Simethicone, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Parfum, Lecithin, Lactic Acid, Linalool, Limonene.\n\nThis one I've found a little less shiny than Ladival, but it leaves a slight whitecast. It's not very noticeable on my skin, and it doesn't collect on my eyelids so I didn't mind it. It's slightly thicker than Ladival and it's looks light beige. I find it very comfortable to wear.\n\nAgain this one pills on reapplication and if you touch it, and it pills much more than Ladival, so I tend to use it less. I only put it on when I'll be outside for a short time, so it wouldn't get the chance to pill. It also turns white in contact with water.\n\nIt has a weird smell which I don't live very much. It is fungal acne safe. I don't think I'd buy this again since there's better sunscreens, but I'll definitely use it up.",

    "body": "Ok folks, I was going to wait to post this review until I had a few more shaves with this cream under my belt. But I just needed to spread the word of this fantastic cream as much as possible.\n\nNow, a little while ago I was looking for products to try that weren't really well known. u/crazindndude mentioned the Stone Cottage Soapworks shaving cream and it really piqued my interest. It piqued my interest so much that I picked up the Fougere and the Suede de Kashmir scents. This review is on the Fougere. \n\nIngredients: \n\nNot too bad of a list - Water, Stearic Acid, Myristic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, fragrance,  Lavandula Officinalis (Lavender) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Geranium) Oil, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium EDTA\n\nPackaging: \n\nA simply done jar with a waterproof top label with the company name on it. The label on the side is a white label with the  scent of the cream and the ingredients on it. The jar itself doesn't feel cheap but it isn't also the super high quality like some of the other offerings out there. Too be honest, packaging and labeling don't deter me from a product so this is a moot point. I actually like the simplicity of it all. \n\nInitial Scent:\n\nOnce I opened the jar I got a light offering of lavender. The scent wasn't too light but it wasn't also slapping me in the nostrils either. Once I got the initial lavender I started to pick up undertones of sandlewood and oakmoss. Overall a pleasant combination that was floral and delicate. A wonderful smelling fougere. \n\nLather:\n\nThe cream itself is a light tan color with a nice shine to it. I loaded the brush for a good 30 seconds. I started lathering and once I dialed the water in I got a nice shiny, slick lather. The initial lightness of the scent was still there but it is extremely pleasant. \n\nPerformance:\n\nI am just going to say that my 3 top creams before using this were Castle Forbes Lavender, ABC, and Alvarez Gomez. I am going to rank this cream above all of them. This is the best shaving cream I haver ever used. The slickness is fantastic. A nice cushion. The post shave feel is immaculate (I am still rubbing my face right now to feel it after my shave this morning). \n\nOverall:\n\nDo yourself a favor if you like creams and look into Stone Cottage Soapworks. $18 for 6oz of a top tier cream is a great deal. The performance is some of the best I have had. On a side note, the scent of the Suede de Kashmir is also great. I will definitely be buying more of this once I run out.\n\nEdit: Spelling (apparently I have been out of school for too long) ",

In my experience, shaving creams (TOBS, SJoL, Cade) require barely a swipe of the brush tips across the surface of the cream and you pick up plenty. Or you can scoop out an almond-sized amount and you're good to go.\n\nI'm wondering if this isn't an extremely soft soap (a la Catie's Bubbles or similar).",

I formulated this to be like the British creams and did so with the assistance of some very good cosmetic chemists in the industry.  The Fougere, in particular, was modeled after Penhaligon's English Fern and I'm happy to hear that people think of that when they smell the scent.  I will be going over our current line and increasing the scent level in a few of them in the next production run.  One has to be very careful when formulating a product like shaving cream that is used on the face and with a razor so I want to be as safe as possible in that respect.  I am working on some other products to introduce in the near future and remember that each shaving cream fragrance has a \"matching\" bar soap that goes along with it!  I also make liquid soap and that is available in Sandalwood and Lavender so you could have soap, shaving cream and liquid soap in those two fragrances!\n\nThanks again for the nice review and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have!\n\nDavidBrucePowers\nStone Cottage Soapworks Inc.",

This soap base has been poured over for six months by Declaration Grooming with the aim to improve upon their already elite bison tallow soap base. Originally released as limited edition, with a scent collaboration with Chatillon Lux, the soap base is now offered in three scents. Declaration Grooming continues to be one of the most popular artisans in wet shaving and features amazing soap and aftershave offerings along with their highly sought after hand tied brushes. Declaration Grooming is available for purchase direct from their website and also stockists such as Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\nContemplation is Declaration Grooming’s idea of how summer smells as opposed to spring. They have taken the bold stance as to no longer provide scent notes and leave the interpretation up to the user. To my nose, this scent is a fougere scent, a summer fougere if you will. Opening with some citrus hints before being met by bright green smells, and rounded out by some darkened green, this scent clearly provides the experience of summer’s vegetation. Scent strength is mid off the sample and remains mid once lathered.  Similarly scented soaps available are Cold River Soapworks Puro Fresco and Talbot Shaving Buttery Brook.\n\nDeclaration’s Icarus soap base is truly amazing. This base is immediately in the driver seat as a contender to be a consensus favorite performing soap base. The soap is firmer than the standard bison tallow base. It loads mindlessly into any knot fiber and demands to be fed water. When properly dialed in, the lather is both voluminous and dense, similar to sour cream with a radiant sheen. The slickness of this soap base, including residual slickness is immediately in my top two, rivaling the slickest soap in my opinion. The post shave is also absolutely amazing and among the most luxurious post shave feelings available. The ingredients in the new soap base are:  Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Mango Seed Butter, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Bison Tallow, Lamb Tallow, Colloidal Oatmeal, Goat's Milk, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tussah Silk. The shavescore for Icarus is a 96. Given this rating this soap base performs similarly to both Talbot Shaving and Barrister & Mann.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free,***\n\n***sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Declaration Grooming Contemplation (PIF)\n* Brush - Simpson’s Chubby 2 “Super Badger” (gift)\n* Razor - Filarmonica 13 “Sub Cero” (PIF)\n* Post - Barrister & Mann Fougere Classique (purchased)",

Game is based on but not a 100% clone of Victoria Secret Very Sexy for Him cologne (which my wife said makes me a \"basic bitch but that's ok\", which I don't know how I feel about that :D), with \"top notes of tangerine, lime, bergamot and caraway; middle notes of sage, cinnamon, Chinese coriander, and bamboo; and base notes of sequoia bark, orange blossom, vetiver, and musk\". What I get off the puck is a light-mid strength scent of a woody cologne. While lathering the scent stays the same to my nose.\n\nThe performance is great as well. It's easy to load and make a lather that had a good density and slickness. Here's the ingredients list: Potassium Tallowate, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Potassium Soybeanate, Petrolatum, Aqua, Sodium Lactate, Potassium Olivate, Fragrance, Bentonite Clay, Cera Alba (beeswax), Tetrasodium EDTA. I find it interesting that there's petroleum jelly in there. It makes for a nice post shave feel.\n\nAll in all, this is a great soap and at $9 US, it's a steal.\n\n*Disclaimer: I bought this soap with my own money*",

    "body": "Hi All!\n\nI would like to try and create a dupe formula of the Paula's Choice 2% BHA solution since for some reason it seems to be more effective than most other salicylic acid products, but I'm not a fan of the price.\n\nThe ingredients of the PC solution are: Water, methylpropanediol, butylene glycol, salicylic acid, polysorbate 20, green tea extract, sodium hydroxide, and tetrasodium edta.\n\nIngredient by ingredient: they list the purpose of the methylpropanediol and butylene glycol as hydrators, but they must also be in there to solubilize the salicylic acid and I imagine as \"penetration enhancers\" as well. I cannot find methylpropanediol anywhere, so I plan to try 1,3-propanediol instead as a next-best option. Butylene glycol I plan to keep. Salicylic acid obviously is staying. The polysorbate 20 is listed as a stabilizer, I'm not sure exactly how this is functioning/necessary in here? Green tea extract for soothing/antioxidant properties. Sodium hydroxide is for pH adjustment, I'll use triethanolamine since I have it. Tetrasodium EDTA for stability, I assume as a chelator because of the inclusion of the green tea extract, I have disodium EDTA, so I plan to use that. I'll also add liquid germall plus for a preservative.\n\nTrying to decide what percentage of propanediol and butylene glycol to use is is a little difficult. The only thing to go off based on the formula is that we know they must be >2% since salicylic acid is at 2%. The solubility of salicylic acid is 15% in propanediol based on the Zemea webiste, so I would assume I would need to include at least 13% to solubilize 2% salicylic acid, however I cannot find any solubility information for salicylic acid in butylene glycol, so I'm not sure how much that is contributing. Consequently I'm not sure how much butylene glycol to include, suggested usage rates are 1-10%.\n\nAs of now, this is the formula I'm working with:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Phase|Ingredient|Percentage|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Water|DI Water|73.3%|\n|Water|1,3-Propanediol|15%|\n|Water|Butylene Glycol|5%|\n|Water|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Water|Polysorbate 20|2%|\n|Water|Disodium EDTA|0.2%|\n|Cool-down|Green Tea Extract|2%|\n|Cool-down|Liquid Germall Plus|0.5%|\n|Cool-down|Triethanolamine|A/R for pH 3.5|\n\nThis is definitely a rough draft; I have more research to do before I think about making this because I'd really like to have a more concrete idea of the 1,3-propanediol and butylene glycol percentage to include. \n\nMy questions then are, has anyone made a similar formula that could shed some light on a better way to determine the propanediol and butylene glycol percentages? Or does anyone have resources or general knowledge on those ingredients that could help? I'm also unsure why the polysorbate 20 is necessary?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

That said, if you don't mind a small amount of alcohol, SA dissolve very well in it. I know, PC hates alcohol in skincare, and yeah, it's not good in large amounts or for dry/sensitive skin. But a small amount in your formula might make it easier to solubilize the SA. I think there are example formulas online, you might have to google a bit. Maybe try Lotioncrafter, MakingCosmetics.",

    "body": "**Quick background: I have acne-prone, combo leaning dry skin. I've been on 0.05% Tretinoin since the end of December 2021.** I've been getting into doing a bath routine so I've been on the hunt for moisturizing masks I can add into my routine to help offset some of the irritation I've been getting from the Tretinoin.\n\nI did a quick browse at Marshalls for any hydrating wash-off mask that was from a brand I've heard of and I found the [**No7 Instant Results Nourishing Hydration Mask**](https://imgur.com/k9IKbs9)**. I skim the** [**ingredients list**](https://imgur.com/zx1iGLL)**(bottom of this post has them typed out) and see it's just got a bunch of standard hydrating ingredients in it, nothing crazy, and I like that it's in an airtight pump which is hygienic, so I purchase it.**\n\nWhen I get home **I look it up on** [**Beautypedia**](https://www.beautypedia.com/products/no7-instant-results-nourishing-hydration-mask/) **for the heck of it, and see that it has a decent rating but it does get shit on for having fragrance.** Fragrance, personally, isn't a deal breaker for me, especially with something I'm gonna wash off eventually. It notes that **petrolatum is near the top of the ingredient list, which isn't an ingredient that I've found to irritate my skin, but it is kind of weird to me to see an occlusive that high up on the ingredient list for something you're just gonna wash off.** Again, my concern here is just regarding efficacy, not that it's going to do anything detrimental.\n\nAnyway, I remove my makeup with an oil cleanser and hop into the bath and get ready to apply this mask. The most obvious thing about this mask is the swirl aesthetic of the bottle. B**eautypedia told me it mixes fine when it pumps out, and that turns out to be** [**kind of a lie**](https://imgur.com/KkuZLzO)**. While you obviously don't see all the portions as separated as they are in the bottle, even once pumped out there's a bit of a marbled look to it still.** My [photo of it](https://imgur.com/U5DWX3L) probably doesn't do it justice but hopefully you get the idea or have experienced something similar with this arbitrarily swirled products.\n\n**I'm looking at this unmixed substance in my hand not sure if I'm supposed to mix it up fully before I apply it to my face? Or is supposed to be applied in this weird suspended manner? I basically just put it on my face and rub it in a bit hoping that it kind of mixes that way.** The texture of it is **incredibly runny, almost more watery than a lotion**, but it adheres to the skin well enough that it stays on during my 20ish minute bath. I go to wash it off, thinking that warm water will do most of the work, as is the case with most hydrating mask, **and then the petrolatum shows its ass.**\n\n**It just doesn't come off. Like maybe 20% of it, the glycerin or whatever else is in there, comes off with water. But it does straight up feel like I have a layer of vaseline on my face.** I was gonna go in with my CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser to really indulge in the gentle self-care hydration vibe I was imagining this evening to be, but I know there's no way that shit is coming off with the cleanser that's basically just conditioner. I use the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser instead, which isn't like patently stripping, but isn't as soothing as the Hydrating one. **Once I get the foaming cleanser lathered up, the mask comes off for the most part.**\n\nI get out of the bath, and my skin looks incredibly dewy and smooth and hydrated. Which might be the glass skin thing people dream of, **but it also might just be a thin residue of vaseline left on my face?** Again, I'm not thinking this residue is gonna cause any problems; it's just kind of annoying and isn't really more helpful than regular slugging. I go forth with my nighttime routine, and there aren't any issues, so I go to bed, trying to ignore my ponderings about the marbled vaseline I had on my face in the bath.\n\n**The next morning, disaster.** I've been doing my current routine for a few weeks now with no issues. **This fucking mask is the only thing that's been different. Somehow I wake up with peeling dry flaky skin all over the lower half of my face, worse than any irritation I've encountered while easing onto the Tretinoin, and I can just FEEL the acne ready to pop out underneath my skin.** I don't know what's causing this issue, since normally I can tolerate slugging with vaseline fine, and I don't think the fragrance would do something this intense. But lord, just avoid this mask at all costs. **It's a bizarre experience to apply it, and it doesn't do anything helpful; in fact, it fucks everything up.**\n\n**Ingredients;**  Aqua (Water/Eau), Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Petrolatum, Butylene Glycol, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Hexyl Laurate, Magnesium Sulfate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Methylparaben, Parfum (Fragrance), Potassium Hydroxide, Ethylparaben, Sodium PCA, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Magnesium PCA, Dipropylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Ceramide 3, Manganese PCA, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide 6 II, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide 1, CI 19140 (Yellow 5), CI 14700 (Red 4).",

This soap base has been poured over for six months by Declaration Grooming with the aim to improve upon their already elite bison tallow soap base. Originally released as limited edition, with a scent collaboration with Chatillon Lux, the soap base is now offered in three scents. Declaration Grooming continues to be one of the most popular artisans in wet shaving and features amazing soap and aftershave offerings along with their highly sought after hand tied brushes. Declaration Grooming is available for purchase direct from their website and also stockists such as Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\nShore is Declaration Grooming’s idea of what the perfect beach smells like. They have taken the bold stance as to no longer provide scent notes and leave the interpretation up to the user. To my nose, this scent is a marine type scent. It evokes the olfactory image of sea air, seawater, sun tan lotion and beach grass. The scent is complex yet familiar and does a wonderful job painting the picture of a beautiful beach. Scent strength is mid off the sample and remains mid once lathered. The animalic note that I smelled during my previous Icarus base review is masked well enough that I cannot detect it in the scent. Similarly scented soaps available are Stirling Soap Co. South Padre and Oleo Soapworks Sandy Cheeks.\n\nDeclaration’s Icarus soap base is truly amazing. This base is immediately in the driver seat as a contender to be a consensus favorite performing soap base. The soap is firmer than the standard bison tallow base. It loads mindlessly into any knot fiber and demands to be fed water. When properly dialed in, the lather is both voluminous and dense, similar to sour cream with a radiant sheen. The slickness of this soap base, including residual slickness is immediately in my top two, rivaling the slickest soap in my opinion. The post shave is also absolutely amazing and among the most luxurious post shave feelings available. The ingredients in the new soap base are:  Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Mango Seed Butter, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Bison Tallow, Lamb Tallow, Colloidal Oatmeal, Goat's Milk, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tussah Silk. The shavescore for Icarus is a 96. Given this rating this soap base performs similarly to both Talbot Shaving and Barrister & Mann.\n\n*Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free,*\n\n*sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.*\n\n* Soap - Declaration Grooming Shore (PIF)  \n* Brush - Yaqi 24mm Aqua Highmountain Silvertip (promotional gift)  \n* Razor - Worcester “Special” (purchased)  \n* Post - Stirling Soap Co.

Recently, Declaration Grooming released a limited edition (at least for now) soap base dubbed ‘Icarus’. This soap base has been poured over for six months by Declaration Grooming with the aim to improve upon their already elite bison tallow soap base. The scent, Santal Auster is a scent designed, in post shave and extrait, form by Chatillon Lux (https://chatillonlux.com/). Many are already aware of the collaborations, both limited and now permanent between Declaration and Chatillon Lux. Together, they offer some of wet shavings most popular and sought after fragrance and soap offerings.  I am fortunate to have been gifted a tub of this soap by /u/120inna55. Please take a moment to read his thorough and eloquaent review of the product (https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/858cx3/declaration_grooming_chatillon_lux_parfums_santal/).\n\nSantal Auster is a natural sandalwood scent, Mysore sandalwood to be precise. This sandalwood smells rich and creamy, but is also soft and powdery. Given the gaminess that the ingredients of this new soap base utilize, I am a bit perplexed by the choice to feature this onenote accord to show either the scent or the soap base off. This mistep is not as egregious as the “Aether fiasco” but it really does a disservice to the scent and the soap base. My nose is initially met by animalic notes from the soap base before smelling the elegant sandalwood. This saddens me because I really enjoy the scent of natural, unadulterated sandalwood. The gaminess becomes subdued but never entirely fades away. I read and executed, the recommended “drying out” period in order to combat this without success. While hard to discern because of the soap bases imparted smell, I venture to say this scent is mid both out of the container and once lathered. Comparable sandalwood scent in wet shaving are Talbot Shaving Iliahi Ridge and Stirling Soap Co. Sandalwood.\n\nDeclaration’s Icarus soap base is truly amazing.

        "body": "> Given the gaminess that the ingredients of this new soap base utilize, I am a bit perplexed by the choice to feature this onenote accord to show either the scent or the soap base off. \n\nI was expecting the worst after the delay announcement. Like with Aether, I was morbidly curious how funky it was going to be. But unlike Aether, I trust the guys behind the brands, and was willing to give them a lot of slack if it were a swing and a miss as they both have goodwill accounts with me that are, like, seven digits into the black.\n\nI made the comment to Scott, tongue in cheek, that I was deeply, deeply disappointed in the soap, as I was promised some certain barnyard/goat smells and received none of those. \n\nAnd I've really been sniffing and huffing deeply from my tub, like I were in a bathroom stall at Studio 54 or something, but I'm not getting goat funk. So perhaps there is something funky there, but despite my best nostril efforts, I'm not picking them up. The proprietors seem to think so, but I got nothing. \n\nOtherwise, all I'm getting is a quite beautiful sandalwood and feeling the opposite of confusion or disappointment (\"shave-horny\" I believe is the technical term). And I'm willing to accept that I may have a Western Sizzlin' nose and trying to judge Ruth's Chris, but I put Santal Auster as either 1A or 1B of all the things Shawn has done. If they wanted to throw some Rose Santal in that soap base, I would support that with the stiffest of shave-boners.\n\nBut all that to say, I think it really did live up to the hype, and besides some salty nonsense on, for instance, DFS, I can't imagine this release being crushed any more than it was.",

Some noses are much more refined that can pick up even the faintest of scents while others fall into a natural ignorance of nuanced smells. \n\nSay you are around a flower shop you may not pick up some more muted floral scents because you are inundated with a number of competing floral scents at once. \n\nOr the inability to pick up gamey or funky scents because you may be around foul odors all day as a norm.\n\nNice review.

I think it’s the Tetrasodium EDTA.\n\nAnyways, I haven’t found other gels that compare. Can anyone tell from this ingredient list what may be helping form nice curl clumps?

It prevents contamination in the stock solution by acting as a metal ion chelator (binds magnesium/calcium/etc. so bacterial enzymes can't use the divalent metals required for their activity). At a high concentration, it can be an irritant, but at 1mM, you shouldn't be able to notice it. \n\nYour more likely candidates are the fragrance and dyes.\n\nOther than that I'm sorry I don't know what to add for curls.",

Hasn’t been sold for about 3 years I think): \n\nAqua / Water,Cyclohexasiloxane,Nylon-12,Isododecane,Alcohol Denat.,Cyclopentasiloxane,PEG-10 Dimethicone,Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone,PEG-20,Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate,Disteardimonium Hectorite,Phenoxyethanol,Magnesium Sulfate,Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate,HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer,Titanium Dioxide [Nano] / Titanium Dioxide,Methylparaben,Acrylonitrile/Methyl Methacrylate/Vinylidene Chloride Copolymer,Tocopherol,Butylparaben,Aluminum Hydroxide,Isobutane,Alumina,Silica,Glycerin,Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate\n\nFast forward to 2 months ago I ruined my hair with Garnier ultimate blends coconut oil shampoo (I forgot this brand ruined my hair in the past):\n\nAqua/Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, CI 14700/Red 4, Cocos Nucifera/Coconut Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxycitronellal, Sodium Hydroxide, Theobroma Cacao Shea Butter/Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Caramel, Citric Acid, Hexylene Glycol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum / Fragrance\n\n(Though I do think my hair is bad with coconut oil, I’m not sure if that’s the sole reason as the result is basically the same as when I used this shampoo in the past) \n\nI initially thought that it’s because my hair is already dry and coarse (as well as low porosity fyi) that these shampoos didn’t do me much good as they have drying alcohols and a few sulphates, and nothing that is really moisturising or nourishing. Though, I thought about it more, and in between the two periods I ruined my hair, I was using this shampoo by Herbal & Essences which also does seem pretty drying, but didn’t damage my hair at all (from what I saw physically):\n\nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Magnesium Nitrate, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Rose Extract, Pearl Extract, CI 19140, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, CI 42090\n\nIt in fact has more sulphates, but also more humectants at the same time. Could it be the alcohol? Or is the problem in fact, not the drying of my hair? I’m really lost and scared to buy another shampoo in case I ruin my hair again.",

You will get a much better recommendation by making an appointment and they can even try out what you want to buy on you before you purchase and take it home! \nSide note: if you use a sulfate free shampoo always wash twice!

He has been like this for the last 20 years. But somehow he just noticed like a year ago that he went bald lol when I complained about my own hair. Even his ID 10 years ago shows him being in the same state as he is now.So he bought some random shampoo's and gave up on them. But he keeps using a \"serum\" which is just advertised in my land. And two weeks ago he said, \"my hair is getting back\" and my Mom agreed that he is really growing some hairs.I ignored it knowing how hard it actually is to get it back after spending thousand of hours reading about hairloss.But I remember checking his scalp from time to time, just cuz fkit I'm balding and wanted to see what I will end up with ok xd. And he is getting more hairs, his crownarea is of course thin af, but there are more hairs then some months ago.The package of the product says the same thing that we know from Minox. \"Takes 2-4months of use to see any difference and that it puts hairs into the anagen phase and keeps them there for longer period of time. Reduces hairloss up to 60%\"But there is no minox in here so what could be the reason it's doing any work?\n\nI buzzed my hair yesterday, thinking to try it out cuz I've lost the fight anyway. But I don't want to put something up there when I've no idea what it is for the rest of my days.",

    "body": "Truefitt and Hill have made quite the name for themselves, be that a good or bad thing for many wet shavers out there. I know that Charky adores their products (even more  than TOBS!), yet Nick Shaves was highly disappointed with their performance.\n\nThis is due to one major difference, Charky uses the T&H creams exclusively, and Nick's only foray into their products was with their hard puck of soap.\n\nT&H's soap is highly polarizing, many claim that it yields nothing but sudsy bubbles and thin lather, while others believe that it takes a dry brush, and plenty of elbow grease to build an exceptional lather out of it. Its following is slight, far behind that of Mitchell's Wool Fat. Aside from that slight following, this soap is unanimously detested for being one of the worst soaps on the market. So let's take a look!\n\n\nIngredients:\nSodium Palmate, Potassium Palmate, Sodium Palm Rernelate, Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Paraffium Liquidum, Isopropyl Myristate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, BHT, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Pentasodium Pentetate.\n\nI am not 100% sure that this is the actual ingredient list as it is hard to come by and unlisted on the T&H website to my knowledge. I had to find this on Amazon, but if anyone in the comments knows this to be incorrect then by all means please inform me.  \n\nThat being said this is far from what I look for in an ingredient list. I see no Stearic Acid which is a big red flag, and on top of that, there is only one oil in the whole soap. I'm not thrilled that the only oil in the soap is Palm oil, a highly controversial soaping ingredient, but at least it's something other than preservatives, which fill the rest of the list.\n\nIngredients - 1/10\n\nPackaging:\nOh damn, it's nice guys. I have it in the hand turned wooden bowl and I don't have much to say on it other than it exudes luxury. The sticker is waterproof, elegant, and classy beyond belief. The bowl has intuitive ridges on the side that help with grip, and the puck fits nicely into the bowl. My only issue with this packaging is how the lid of the bowl is only loosely placed onto the bowl, with no way to secure it. However, that is the price you pay for wooden bowls.\n\nPackaging - 9.5/10\n\nScent:\nT&H list the 1805 scent as: \"Fresh and oceanic, 1805 has top notes of bergamot, mandarin and cardamom, combined with a lavender, geranium and clary sage heart resting on a sandalwood, cedarwood and musk base.\"\n\nI get just about none of that aside from the oceanic bit, and even then I think it would be a bit of a stretch to call this an aquatic. I have far from a sophisticated nose, but I'm adequate at picking out certain notes here and there. That being said, to me 1805 smells sweet and perfume-like, and that's the extent of what I smell here. It's not a bad smell by any means, just relatively simplistic.\n\nHowever, I do smell something strange here as well. Something that to me smells like a backing of fat, like lard. There is no tallow or any type of animal product in the soap, so I'm not sure where this is coming from. That being said, no one else I have asked smelled such an undertone.\n\nScent - 6/10\n\nLather:\nNow this is where I was really nervous. So far, I was more or less a fan of the soap, but this could change everything. I let a Stirling Kong soak while I took a shower and left the soap to bloom. When I got out, I was ready for whatever may come, be it suds or yogurt, I was ready.\n\nIt was suds, I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, but it pretty much matched up with what everyone is saying about it. I loaded for about a minute and got nothing but suds, even with a fully wrung out brush. I persisted in an attempt to salvage any chance I had, and then it happened, slowly but surely, a paste began to form between the bristles.\n\nI persisted, building the paste more and more, until I was ready to transfer it to my face. When the time came, I brought the brush to my face, and immediately I was met with the discouraging sound of large air bubbles popping. As I built the lather on my face, I noticed that it has a foamy yet hydrated sheen over it, and was a bit denser than bath soap.\n\nObviously there was no cushion here, but being a relatively aggressive shaver, with tough skin, and soft facial hair I have very little need for tons of cushion. It's still nice to feel protected, however. The soap really surprised me with its slickness, this stuff was incredibly slick. My razor would just glide down my face, with endless amount of ghost lather available. This could be due to the fact that the lather was basically suds, but I have to give credit where credit is due, the soap is very slick.\n\nAfter the surprisingly close shave, my face didn't feel at all moisturized, but it didn't feel dried out either. A post shave balm is not necessary but is recommended.\n\nLather - 4/10\n\nPrice:\n$48, nope. Just nope. You'll get a nice bowl for mediocre soap that smells fairly nice. I'm not even going to do the math for how much that is per ounce, because it's not worth it regardless.\n\nPrice - 0/10\n\nOverall:\nTruefitt and Hill 1805 Luxury Shaving Soap is a misfire. It's ingredients are not inherently conducive to shaving soap, it's scent is pleasant but one note, it's lather is downright bad, and it's completely overpriced. You would be wise to avoid it, however, I would be lying if I said it didn't surprise me.\n\nTo be quite honest, I felt fondly for this soap originally, as its presentation is beautiful, and it's very slick. I hardly use it, however I'm glad I have it as a decoration or a once in a while use. This doesn't change the fact that it's not nearly on par with any of the artisans, even artisans I don't particularly care for offer better products than this soap.\n\nOverall: 20.5/50 which equates to an F, which makes sense to me. It's not quite worth purchasing, but if you own a puck by some circumstance it's at least worth a try, the slickness might surprise you!\n\nThank you all for reading! Keep shaving!",

Re: palm oil, although I agree with your stance on it, I will say that palm oil as well as tallow have high amounts of stearic acid (I'm pretty sure anyway), which is probably why extra wasn't added. That said, your lather speaks for itself and the soap probably does need more goodies in it :)",

I've been looking high and low for a good anti-aging moisturizer that is not ridiculously expensive. The closest thing I can find is Olay's Quench, which has niacinamide - but nothing else really. And I find it greasy feeling. Makeup Artist's Choice has a nice-looking lotion, but it's $25 for 8 oz!!! Yeah that will last me about 2 weeks :(\n\nI don't know why it seems no drugstore companies have thought to put nice things like ceramides, niacinamide and peptides into body lotions. I don't want to have young face/old body!\n\nMy favorite lotion is Lubriderm's Shea and Cocoa Butter Daily Moisture. Here are the ingredients: Water, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Dimethicone, Petrolatum, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Ceteareth-20, DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Citrate, Titanium Dioxide, Fragrance, Panthenol, Citric Acid\n\nIs this a crazy idea? Should I just stick with creating my own body lotion with all these goodies from scratch?",

Water allows bacteria/mold to grow.  The niacinamide is a powder, and it's in a pretty low concentration.  I mix powders into my moisturizer but only enough to last a few days.  I use Skinactives and they have a lot of info about DIY on their website as well.\n\nYou can also look at Ponds Clarant B3 lotion.  I think it comes in a decent sized container and isn't too expensive?  Niacinamide is the third ingredient or so and it supposed to be around 4%.  I am not a fan of the scent (kind of grandmotherly) but it's not too bad I suppose.",

The barcode sticker was blue inside when peeled off.\n\nSecond version started looking how it currently looks on the amazon product photos https://imgur.com/a/ivUQrfB and they removed expiration dates, having only batch numbers stamped in the top.\n\nNewest version with a new formulation looks exactly the same from the front, only the text on the back has changed, and expiration dates are back.

    "body": "Around this time for the past few years The Art Of Shaving has done a \"seasonal\" release of a peppermint shaving cream for the holidays.  I admit I've been intrigued with it so when the holidays rolled around again this year I decided to crack open my wallet and try a jar.\n\nThink \"candy canes.\"  :)\n\nThat's certainly the \"vibe\" they're going for I think.  From the vertical stripe design of the packaging to the sweet, strong-but-refreshing peppermint scent, it almost feels like you have a jar of holiday candy in your hand.  Speaking of scent, I don't think it's \"artificial\" or \"plastic\" smelling at all--it really smells like a true peppermint scent to me.  Taylor of Old Bond Street has a Peppermint shave cream too but I think it's more of an \"herbal\" note than a \"sweet\" note.\n\nThe cream's consistency is noticeably \"wetter\" looking and feeling compared to other AOS shave creams I have.  No doubt this is because of the short-duration manufacturing run.\n\nOn the face this cream really lathers up luxuriously for me, even in my \"hard\" water--the lather just explodes on my shaving brush.  The scent's strength softens up agreeably after lathering: on the face it's still there but it's not a \"knock you over\" scent like, say, Castle Forbes Limes.  I seem to get a very mild cooling sensation on the skin from it, but that might be because my bathroom is cold in the morning when I shave (hey, it's Winter). :)  There's no menthol in this cream so no dramatic skin cooling effect which may not be desirable in the Winter anyway.\n\nAnd the performance has really been outstanding for me!  No kidding, the glide and cushioning has really been exceptional.  Better than the other AOS creams I have (which I think are actually reasonably good.  I won't comment on their soaps or their hardware...).\n\nSo if you're looking for something to get you into the holiday mood try shaving with AOS's Peppermint shaving cream.  You may feel like a kid walking down the holiday candy isle.\n\nIngredients: Water, Palmitic Acid, Myristic Acid, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Acid, Glycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Mentha Piperita (peppermint oil), Sodium Hydroxide, Lauric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Tetrasodium Edta, Disodium Edta, Methylisothiazolinone\n\nFull article with links [HERE](http://sharpologist.com/2016/12/aos-peppermint.html)\n",

This is just my base right now, I plan on adding some extracts in future batches, and swapping out the distilled water for a hydrosol. The recipe I tried right now is: \n\n90.5% distilled water\n\n5% oil (I used jojoba) \n\n2% glycerin \n\n2% Aristoflex AVC \n\n1% tetrasodium EDTA\n\n0.5% liquid germall plus\n\nI only made 50g worth of product, so I'm not mad if I just have to scrap it. I put my water and EDTA into one beaker, and my glycerin and AVC into another. Dissolved my EDTA in tgevwater, then added my water to the glycerin and AVC. Blended that up and got a really nice gel. Added my oil and it's still a really nice consistency. Then I just added my preservative, blended once more and took the pH. It came out to haveva pH of 8.3 and I'm not sure how. I added 0.21g of citric acid to bring it back down to a pH of 4 5. Is this still okay to use? I know AVC prefers a pH between 4-9 and any higher than 9 it'll produce ammonia. I'm just kind of wondering what happened here. Thank you!",

Slow healing Generally have some clogged pores/comedones plus a couple hormonal nodules every month. Usually some ongoing PIH+PIE (red-brown acne marks) from that.\n\nAllergic/reactive to strongly fragranced skincare, shea butter, MCI/MI (a relatively uncommon preservative). Mineral oil and lanolin suit my skin a lot better than plant oils.\n\n♦️ **Climate:** Mumbai. Hot and humid summers.\n\n♦️ **Current routine:**\n\n☀️ AM: \n+ Acne Squad Kick-Start Cleanser\n+ DIY vitamin c serum ([details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/eIi64ptr8k)) with glycerin and green tea extract added in to make it hydrating\n+ Dermadew Aloe cream [(review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/QCyo55E2rI) with a pinch of Purenso Colloidal Oatmeal powder (I skip the powder if wearing sunscreen, otherwise it causes pilling)\n+ Vilvah Melt-in-Milk SPF30 ([review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/hIPvg9vFiC)) if facing windows indoors or stepping out briefly, Vilvah SPF50 if spending time outdoors. Skip if entirely indoors.\n\n🌙 PM: \n+ DIY cleansing balm (if wearing makeup)\n+ Simple Refreshing Face Wash\n+ Minimalist AHA BHA 10% exfoliator OR Minimalist 3% Tranexamic Acid Face Serum (or a skip day if I feel my skin needs it)\n+ Dermadew Aloe cream with a pinch of Purenso Colloidal Oatmeal powder mixed in (also over the lips)\n+ 100% lanolin as an occlusive balm - dabbed on the lips, healing acne spots, and (if sleeping in AC or feeling like my skin is sensitised) a thin overall layer by rubbing between the palms and gently pressing all over the face.\n\nNote that I built up to this routine of actives by introducing them one at a time, over the course of several weeks.\n\n♦️ **Age:** Early 30s\n\n♦️ **Usage timeline:** just under a month, every morning.\n\nThe brand directs you to use it daily, AM/PM, which is a bit confusing - does that mean twice a day? 🤔\n\n#✨️Ingredient list: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Sodium chloride, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Acrylates Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Coconut Acid, Fragrance, Terpineol, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-6, Citric Acid, Salicylic Acid, PEG-150 Distearate, Thymol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Butylhydroxytoluene, Sodium hydroxide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Saccharide Isomerate, Linalool.\n\nNotably, contains an unspecified percentage of salicylic acid (looks like 0.5% if we speculate that phenoxyethanol is 1% and the ingredients are in decreasing order) and what they call their \"patented Thymol T Essence™\" which is a botanical extract that has antimicrobial properties.\n\nIs sulphate- and paraben-free, does contain fragrance, linalool, terpineol and thymol as potentially sensitising ingredients.\n\n♦️ **Claims and expectations:**\n\n>A gentle, sulphate-free cleanser created with Thymol T Essence™ & Salicylic Acid, clinically proven to reduce acne causing bacteria & soothe acne in 3 days. Restores moisture leaving skin hydrated with Pentavitin™ molecules.\n\nThe \"soothing acne\" and whole Acne Squad approach with their stages of acne was what got me interested, because yeah, when you're acne-prone it's a cycle that is naturally always ongoing. That seemed realistic to me, I appreciate that. I had been using a 2% salicylic cleanser in the daytime (Zitcare foaming face wash) and was curious to see if a cleanser with less salicylic that had a different antimicrobial action would be more effective and maybe work better for my sensitive skin? \n\nThis proved to not be the case 🙃\n\n♦️ **Price:** MRP ₹325 for 100ml (always available at reduced price of under 300)\n\n#✨️Texture, consistency and fragrance\n\nThe texture is like most other foaming cleansers that come in a tube, but not super thick. It's a clear gel that makes a soft and fine foam when rubbed between damp hands. Does not lather a lot, but enough to satisfy those of us who need the foamy feeling 😂\n\nIt has a fresh, herby-spicy fragrance that is characteristically from thyme. Quite mild, doesn't linger at all and only lasts for a few seconds when massaged on a wet face and rinsed.\n\nThose who like the smell of tea tree, rosemary or similar green fragrances would like it. Maybe even people who like minty/menthol face washes. I personally really enjoy a herby fragrance, so I enjoyed using it every morning ☺️\n\n♦️ Packaging - a very cute lilac tube. Looks and feels great, but at least initially, the products tends to run out and it dispenses too much just with gravity. It's better to open it with the cap upwards and then flip it down to dispense. A small detail, but mildly annoying at first.\n\n#✨️Effects\n\nFoams quickly and applies very smoothly on a qet face - no dragging at all. The foam only lasts a few seconds after application on the face, and quickly disappears.\n\nThe result is a nicely cleansed face that isn't too stripped of oils. Using a smaller amount gives a gentler cleanser, and using more gives a stronger cleanse. \n\nHere's my problem - after about two weeks of using it daily in the mornings, I started experiencing mild barrier damage and redness. Especially around the nose corners (a tell-tale sign for those with sensitive skin). My skin texture became slightly bumpy all over, and I saw a few pinrpick pustules. Initially I figured I'd just dial back the exfoliation, but that didn't make a difference and eventually I stopped using this cleanser. Within two days my skin was back to normal and drinking up glycolic acid like nobody's business 😂\n\nJust goes to show, even sensitive skin is sensitive TO very particular things. I also use acids in my routine, so that might have had some impact, but I personally find that my skin likes acids and is more likely to react badly to botanical extracts in general. Just confirms that 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\nI didn't find it affected my acne in any way, but considering my skin's reaction, that doesn't mean much.\n\n#✨️Final thoughts, pros and cons\n\nI actually really liked using this cleanser, and am somewhat disappointed it didn't work for me. I think it's a nice product, something of a level up from menthol type acne face washes of the past. A nice gateway product for men who are stuck on the \"for men\" train to try normal skincare 😂\n\nI think it would probably work quite well for people of all sebum levels, oily, combo, even dry if used in small amounts. \n\nNormal and resilient skin types would probably find it works well. If you're not using any serums or treatments for acne, I think it's worth a shot to see if this cleanser helps.\n\nIf you have sensitive skin I would use with caution, especially if you already know your skin reacts badly to essential oils, since the extracts are key constituents of those. This doesn't guarantee it won't work for you, just a heads up to keep an eye on your skin (like I did - no real harm done).\n\n\n♦️ **Repurchase status:**\n\nSadly, a WNRP. One of those products that I know a majority of people will probably like, but just doesn't suit me personally. Anyway, I think I can just skip a treatment cleanser in the mornings now (and save it for summer mornings, when I have more oiliness).\n\nI'd love to hear from others who have used this product! Searching the sub didn't bring up any full reviews, is why I chose to post, but I know there's people out there using it. See you in the comments!",

    "body": "So after doing a bit of research on conditioning and buying oils I decided to buy a bottle of beard oil, the processing and shipping to get that oil took about two full weeks.\n\nIn the meantime I decided to just use some lotion on my face, the Maui Tan Hemp Lotion. I figured why not? It should keep my skin soft and maybe it would help the beard too! The past two weeks my beard has reached what it would normally take a full month to reach (been a while since I've grown anything out though, this could be due to aging etc). After getting my beard oil I decided to check the ingredients, which made me curious about what was in my lotion.\n\n > Water (Aqua), Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) Oil, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Starch, Octenyl Succinate, Hempseed (Cannabis Sativa) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Sesame (Sesamum Indicum) Oil, Jojoba (Buxus Chinensis) Oil, Sunflower (Helianthus Annus) Seed Oil, Olive (Olea Europaea) Oil, Tea Tree (Melaleuca Alternifolia) Oil, Green Tea (Camellia Oleifera) Extract, Calendula Officinalis Extract, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Tetrasodium Edta, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Mathylparaben, Proplyparaben, BHT, Fragrance, Citric Acid.\n\nObviously this has a lot of similar oils etc to what is typically found in beard oils. I was wondering if any knowledgeable beard expert (beardxpert, beardspert?) could give any insight to whether or not some of these ingredients are harmful to use at night on my beard before going to sleep. \n\nI haven't noticed any negative side effects as of yet (my beard is ridiculously soft), but I'd like to avoid creating any unnecessary hardships for it.",

    "body": "Long rant so brace yourself. So I was looking over my dog's shampoo recently and was fairly surprised at the ingredients in them. Coconut and jojoba oils, fish oil, hemp oil, and nothing that really stood out to me that would flag it as unsafe but I'm also an ignoramus sooo... Without finding too much luck on the internet with people who have tried it I decided to give it a go. Just a little background, my scalp has recently been EXTREMELY itchy, dry and flaky, and gets pretty oily after two days without washing. I've tried a number of different methods before, and I haven't found anything holistic that has stuck, and I'm pretty set on not having to break my bank unless I really can't find anything else. So I decided why the hell not. I used the dog shampoo. It probably would have worked better had I washed it in the morning rather than going to sleep with wet hair, but man. My scalp feels SO much better its insane. My hair itself is pretty soft, and not at all frizzy like usual. I have read about the difference in a dogs ph vs a humans, so I am a little cautious but man. I really do notice a difference. I'll list the ingredients for reference: Purified water, anionic, non ionic, and amphoteric surfactants, acrylates cocopolymar, polyquaternium-7, fragrance, jojoba oil, dl-panthenol, dmdm-hydantoin, tetrasodium edta, dc red 33, natural pigments.\n\nSo if anyone else has ever had a similar experience, I'd love to hear about it! Feel free to let me know if this is ultimately a terrible idea haha.\n\nTL;DR I used dog shampoo and I might use it forever unless somebody tells me otherwise.",

I only see jojoba oil? Or is that in a different bottle?\n\nAlso what are the anionic, non ionic and mphoteric surfactants? It appears to be something in the process of making soap and the function of soap, but it's a bit vague. I'm not sure if it's a harsh detergent or not, because it doesn't mention which type it is. Anionic surfactants could be alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates or just soap? So is it sulfates or soap? Both ending with sulfates appear to be similar to SLES. So it's nice to know which one it is. It looks kind of confusing, because they're not clearly telling you what is in there.\n\nI'm not sure, I wish I could be more enthusiastic for you and be like 'go ahead!' but I'm not too confident about it to be honest. I'd love to hear from someone with more knowledge about the surfactants.\n\nAbout the pH, I believe it increased to the alkaline pH right? You could consider an ACV rinse, maybe that could either neutralize it or bring the pH back again. The right pH can really help in a healthy scalp.",

    "body": "Hi, all!\n\nI recently switched shampoos and am now experiencing mild breakouts on my back and around my hairline.\n\nPrior to the switch, I was using Herbal Essence's Hello Hydration shampoo and conditioner. While using this shampoo and conditioner combination, my hair seemed dry, frizzy, and fragile. However, it did not cause me to break out anywhere.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium 76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nA little over a week ago, I stopped using both of the above products and switched to SheaMoisture's Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo to try to get away from sulfates. I started only with the shampoo, not the conditioner, because I break out very easily and wanted to test each product separately so that I'd know what product was causing me to break out if I did indeed end up breaking out (it's a mistake I've made before).\n\nThe ingredients in that shampoo:\n\n> Deionized Water, Decyl Glucoside(Coconut Oil), African Butyrospermum Parkii (shea Butter)*, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Argan Oil, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Rosemary Extract, Sea Kelp Extract, Vitamin E, Guar Gum, Lonicera Capifloium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Avacado Oil\n\nAfter a little over a week of using this shampoo every other day, I've noticed a change in my hair. It seems healthier, less frizzy, and easier to manage. I LOVE the improvement. However, since the change, I've also experienced breakouts on my back, around my hairline, and on my cheeks where the ends of my hair touch my face. This makes me incredibly sad, because I love what this product does to my hair, but the breakouts mean I can no longer use it.\n\nAre any of the ingredients in this shampoo particularly comedogenic? Which one(s) could I be reacting to? I really like the change this product made to my hair, so is there a shampoo similar to this one that is less likely to break me out?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nIf it helps identify ingredients I might be sensitive to, a long time ago, I dyed my hair black, and after noticing that the Hello Hydration Shampoo made the color fade quickly, I switched to Herbal Essence's Color Me Happy Shampoo and Conditioner. That stuff broke me out horribly. I know that it was the shampoo and/or conditioner and not the dye because I didn't switch products immediately after dying my hair but waited a few weeks. I experienced no breakouts during that time and only broke out after switching shampoo and conditioner. I switched to both at the same time however, so I have no way of knowing whether it was the shampoo, conditioner, or both that caused me to break out.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Red 33, Red 4, Yellow 10\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Benzyl Alcohol, EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 10, Red 33, Yellow 6",

    "body": "I’m a swim instructor I am usually in a chlorinated pool 6x week, 2 3-hour sessions a day. I used to use just any regular shampoo, conditioner and soap twice a day supposedly to remove chlorine after each pool session but apparently it’s not working because I still smell like chlorine. I used to not care much about the smell of chlorine that lingers on my hair and skin but I do mind the damage. My dark brown, fine, straight hair does dry out and changes to lighter color plus my skin is perpetually dry.\n\nI am trying to be more caring to my hair and skin this year, I make sure to shower before getting into the pool, I have added a clarifying shampoo weekly and applying hair masks whenever I feel like the ends of my hair needs it which lately is looking like I have to do it more about 3x a week. Side note, my scalp is extremely oily too so I’m only using the hair mask on the bottom half of my hair. My hair mask has a really strong fragrance too and it kinda hides the chlorine smell from my hair. \n\nReading up on some posts, I probably need a chelating shampoo. Usual chlorine-neutralizing shampoo brands like ultraswim  are not readily available in my country and it’ll be super expensive if I try to order one so I researched a bit more and I figured I need any product with EDTA. \n\nSo anyway, I found this baby hair and body wash and I saw that it has EDTA in the ingredients. Can I use this as my shampoo and shower gel after a session in the pool? Would this remove chlorine or would buying and using this be a bad idea? I’ll list the ingredients below:\n\nIngredients: Purified Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Whey Filtrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Citric Acid, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Benzoic Acid, Lactic Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nWould really appreciate any opinions or advice. I’m also planning to use my hair mask as a regular conditioner if my hair stays too dry this summer.",

The best option would probably be to get two shampoos, one for daily use and one clarifying/chelating shampoo (people usually recommend the Neutrogena one) once a week.\n\nEdited to add: also do you use a swim cap?

        "body": "When I had hard water and researched chelating shampoos, what I found was that disodium EDTA can be used as a preservative or a foaming agent, but it can also be used as a chelating ingredient, and it has to do with the amount in the formula. A lot of the shampoos and conditioners I used back then had an EDTA in them at the bottom of the ingredient list, but they did not remove the hard water buildup from my hair, and I had to buy an actual chelating shampoo to address the buildup issue. Have you checked the ingredients on shampoos you’ve used in the past to see if any of them have an EDTA?\n\nI think the SLES in that shampoo could probably be a big help in cleansing your hair, especially if you were using something sulfate-free before. But if that doesn’t work, could you ask a hairstylist in your country for product recommendations?\n\nIf Bumble and bumble products are sold in your country, I found their Sunday shampoo worked great for chelating.",

In this case, tetrasodium EDTA is the second-to-last ingredient listed, which means it is a very low quantity in the product, however higher up in the list is citric acid, another chelating agent.  So it might work!  You could give it a shot.  \n\nPer [this article](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/your-hair-on-chlorine.html) in my favorite hair science blog, applying coconut oil or conditioner to your hair before your swim can help protect it from the damaging effects of chlorine. \n\nI have also heard of people who have had success keeping their hair completely dry while swimming by wearing two swim caps at the same time (making sure they both have a pretty snug fit), but even just one cap that still lets some water in would help somewhat.\n\nAnd then as far as removing the smell / treating it afterwards, you can try to find a chelating shampoo/body wash, or there are DIY chelation remedies as well.  In the article I linked above, it has a recipe for doing a hair rinse with diluted citric acid.\n\nThat same blog has [another article on hard water](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/03/hard-water-and-your-hair.html) and using chelating agents for removing minerals, it lists some products that you might look for, and chelating ingredients to look for in your products if you don't find those specific products.",

(The alum is a gift from my family, the rest is bought with my own money over time)\n\n\n**ingredients**\n\nPotassium Tallowate, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Glycerin, Parfum, Parafinium, Liquidum, Tetrasodium EDTA, Etidronic Acid, Disodium Distrylbiphenly, Disuffonate Amyl Cinnamel, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool\n\n\n**thoughts**\n\n\nArko shave stick is something I have heard of many times and seen many times. Delivered in a bit of red foil with the for me classic logo, it was a bit messy to Open since the soap stuck to the foil wrapper. White with a small hint of yellow in colour,  it almost looks like a piece of handsoap. And the scent, a breeze hint of mild lemon, almost like a soft air refresher. The scent I have no troubles with at all, and it does fade over time. I have tried it some times,  and the results are mostly the same.\n\n\n\nWetting my face, really getting it soaked. And rubbing the soap stick all over my face, dipping it in the sink to replace the wet soap that got to my face.\n\n\nGetting a damp brush and just start to lather it right on there. Adding more water as i go, buildkng up a nice lather as I have done before. Getting a good glide is what I want. And you know what? Before I am done, the scent is gone. This is basically unscented, that short is the scent lasting. \n\n\nToday, a with the grain pass, followed by some more lathering, and a final pass of across the grain, but not on the neck. That place only got the with the grain.  And ouch, my face is dry. Rinse of with water, apply some alum, and remove it quickly because now the face is on fire! Witch hazel, Barrister and Mann reserve splash, and face moisturiser. Just to add good stuff to my skin. And aloe vera. And my face is still feeling dry and it hurts.\n\n\n**summary**\n\nI would give this a **2/10**, because the scent is pleasant and it can easily build a lather. But it hurts the skin. Hurts my skin. I am sorry if you like this soap, I do not. And it was not easy finding a listing of the ingredients,  what did i put on my face? I know now after some searching the Web, but it will probably be never again.",

I shaved the underside and deep conditioned with every wash it because it was all broken off, started washing my hair less (once every 3 or 4 days now), stopped using heat products, get haircuts every 8-10 weeks, and  tried buying better shampoos/conditioners for my hair.\n\n\nAt that time, I bought an olive oil shampoo/conditioner pair from Regis Designline and it seemed to work well. I've used it for a year now and my hair seems tired of it, so I tried purchasing some new ones after asking my hair dresser for a suggestion. I've tried Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Moisturizing Shampoo ( which is supposedly sulfate free and has argon oil in it) and also Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny line. Healthy Sexy Hair made my hair feel strawlike and Paul Mitchell's made it oily within a day, and feels almost waxy when it's drying. \n\n\nI've never dyed or permed my hair and have med-course and straight-wavy hair. I'm half Cambodian, half white, so I'm wondering if my hair chemistry is different from what they make products for. When doing at home masks, my hair seems to like olive oil. Since trying these shampoos, my hair has gotten frizzier, I've noticed new split ends that weren't there before, and is more tangled. Any suggestions to try?\n\n\n\n**Healthy Sexy Hair Soy**\n\n\nWater (Aqua, Eau), Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, PEG-4 Rapeseedamide, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Acrylates Copolymer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Glycerin, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone, C11-15 Pareth-7, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Disodium EDTA, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Potassium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Benzoate, Panthenol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Ammonium Chloride, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone.\n\n\n\n**Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny**\n\n\nAqua (Water, Eau), Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Cocamide MIPA, Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Isoceteth-20, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Algae Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Polyquaternium-10, Trideceth-12, PEG-150 Distearate, PEG-3 Dioleoylamidoethylmonium Methosulfate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone, Triethyl Citrate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, C11-15 Pareth-7, C12-16 Pareth-9, Magnesium Nitrate, Bisamino PEG/PPG-41/3 Aminoethyl PG-Propyl Dimethicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Parfum (Fragrance), Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool\n\n\n\n**Regis DesignLine Olive Oil**\n\n\nwater, olea europaea (olive) leaf extract, sodium laureth sulfate, disodium lauroamphodiacetate, PEG-10 olive glycerides, cocamide mea, cocamidopropyl betaine, polysorbate-80, polyqaurternium-4, hydrolyzed wheat protein, PEG-12 dimethicone, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, fragrance, methylparaben, propylparaben, diazolidinyl urea, green 5, yellow5\n\n",

There are lots of wavy girls over there that could help you out.  \n\n\nEdit: I forgot to say to keep away from sulfates and silicones for sure. Sulfates are harsh and damaging. Silicones coat your hair and keep moisture from it, and without heavy cleaners like Sulfates, silicones cause gross build up on your hair.",

I do remember when messing around with alcohol-free fragranced hair mist formulas I used Polysorbate to bind the fragrance to the water and hated the cloudy look, so before I tossed it out, I poured some alcohol into it (granted mine was isopropyl) and it became clear very quickly.\n\nAlso, what is the ph?",

I'd like to share it and also include other products I have tried below:\n\n**-Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash**: \n\n**Ingredients**: Water (Aqua), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Parfum), Bht, Tetrasodium Edta, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\n**My thought:** this product is unscented but does contain masking fragrance. Fragrance is listed on the ingredient list. I tried using it as a body wash and also doubled up as hand soap, and either ways I found this product fairly drying. It makes my skin tight and uncomfortable. Not my favorite body wash.\n\n**-Olay Eczema Prone Skin Soothing Body Wash:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Petrolatum, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Trideceth-3, Niacinamide, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Citrate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Glyceryl Oleate, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Vitamin B3.\n\n**My thought:** This product is a recent discovery of mine and I love it! It's truly fragrance free and unscented. The texture is fluffy, moisturizing, but rinses clean without leaving behind any residue. I also use it as hand soap and it works perfectly. This has to be my favorite body wash I have found so far.\n\n**-Eucerin Skin Calming Body Wash**: \n\n**Ingredients:** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Laureth-4, MIPA-Laureth Sulfate, Poloxamer 101, Laureth-9, Propylene Glycol, Water, Propyl Gallate, BHT.\n\n**My thought:** I tried this product a few years ago but didn't end up repurchasing. It’s fragrance free but not truly unscented in my opinion. It has a chemical/fish oil smell due to the omega oils which I imagine can be bothersome to some people. It’s also quite liquidy so you have to use a lot and it runs out quickly. Overall, the texture is just not as pleasant to use as the Olay one.\n\n**Sum up:** Olay Eczema Prone Skin Soothing Body Wash is the best one I have found. I'll attach picture of the product below in case anyone is interested.",

I was ordering a lactic acid peel and couldn't resist trying out their foundation.  They sell sample sizes for $2.25.  I got the shade Fair, which is the second lightest shade with neutral undertones.\n\n[Link](http://www.makeupartistschoice.com/BellEvolve-Liquid-Mineral-Skin-Therapy-Foundation_p_242.html)\n\n\"Based in aloe vera juice, this foundation glides on easily and provides a luminous glow to the skin, while the aloe nourishes and protects the skin from irritation.\n \nAdditional Benefits:\n \n--Jojoba oil is good for all skin types and is non-comedogenic... pore minimizing, it has a high concentration of ceramides which keep the skin moist, more elastic, and resistant to aging... anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial properties.\n\n--DMAE and Rosemary Extract will lift and tone the skin.\n\n--Titanium and Zinc Oxides provide UVA/UVB Sun Protection between SPF 15 - SPF 20\n \n--Meadowfoam Oil provides antioxidant protection, non-greasy moisturization, and anti aging benefits\n\n--Neem provides anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-microbial protection\n\n--Vitamin E nourishes.\n\n--Rosemary Extract helps to enhance circulation and reduces the appearance of broken capillaries.\n \n--Carrot Oil adds skin healing benefits, moisturizes, provides antioxidant protection and cell regenerative qualities.\"\n\n*Ingredients:\nAloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Simmondsia chinensis (Organic Jojoba) Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Emulsifying Wax, Iron Oxide, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Phenoxyethanol, Mica, Zinc Oxide, Dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), Stearic Acid, Limnanthes alba (Meadowfoam) Oil, Daucus carota sativa (Carrot) Oil, Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary Extract), Azadirachta indica (Neem), Tetrasodium Edta(May contain sodium bicarbonate and/or citric acid as pH adjusters)*. \n\n\nWith such intriguing ingredients, I just couldn't resist.  It feel very light on my skin.  Since it is aloe-based, it feels more like a cool skin cream than a makeup product.  As a result, the coverage seems very light too.

Ingredients below.\n\n-----\n\nUntil now I've been using Paula's Choice BHA exfoliants, first PC Exfoliating 2% BHA Liquid then PC Clear Extra Strength Anti-Redness Exfoliating Solution, and I've been very satisfied with these products.\n\nHowever, PC's European prices seem to have gone up around 25-30 % over the new year. As a result, a 118 ml bottle of BHA now costs me around 40 € (~50 $) when shipping costs are included. For a student budget, that's ludicrous.\n\nI actually happened to buy LaraChem's Salicylic Acid recently. With 22 $ for 120 ml + 10 $ shipping from Canada it's around 20 $ less than PC Europe without VAT, and still cheaper even if you're charged VAT (24 % in my country).\n\nI've only been using LC's BHA for a few days so I can't testify for the results yet; it has kind of a thicker consistency, still liquid but more towards a gel. It also has a stronger smell, maybe because it's 5 % instead of 2 %.\n\nHow do you think the products compare ingredients-wise? Help would be much appreciated!\n\n-----\n\n* Ingredients\n\nPC 2% BHA Liquid & PC Clear Extra Strength 2 % BHA (pH range 3.2-3.8):\nAqua, Methylpropanediol (slip agent/water-binding agent), Butylene Glycol (water-binding agent/humectant/slip agent), Salicylic Acid (Beta Hydroxy Acid, exfoliant), Camellia Oleifera (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (anti-irritant), Polysorbate 20 (emulsifier), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizing agent).\n\nLaraChem 5 % Salicylic Acid (pH 3.3 ± 0.1):\nDistilled Water, Salicylic acid, Sodium Citrate, Propylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose and Sodium Hydroxide\n\nDoing a quick search on PC ingredient database the LC additional ingredients seem to have ratings of Good except for one Average (\"irritating in high amounts\", but it's below 5 % so I guess that's fine). Does anyone know if the extra ingredients of PC compared to LC affect the effectiveness of the BHA in any way? Has anyone else compared these two products?",

I'm sick and tired of Natural ideologues just hand-waving away all our scientific progress under the rash statement that \"Bah, you fools just made that in a lab. My mountain juice is better than anything human dedication and effort can produce.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First, the premise of my argument.**\n\n \\- Can we all agree that the universe we live in behaves predictably in accordance with certain patterns? For example, a positively-charged particle will attract negatively-charged particles.\n\n \\- This does not mean \"scientists made that law up.\" Scientists create hypotheses (Guesses) about the patterns mentioned above. Specifically, they guess what the pattern is. If the guess is proved right by a significant amount of experiments (testing their guesses) then AND ONLY THEN does it move from a Hypothesis to a Theory. When a Theory has been proven by a very, very large amount of evidence, THEN AND ONLY THEN does it become a Law, which means that scientists have tested this guess again and again in every conceivable condition, and they are practically certain that this is the way the universe behaves. There are not that many Laws relative to theories and hypotheses because the rules of science state that you have to hold this procedure to THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARD OF QUALITY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Next, the argument I wish to refute.**\n\n*\"Natural products are always better than synthetic products because they come from The Earth and thus are safer for humans.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am gonna refute this argument: I will make the statement that \"Natural products cannot be safer for consumption by humans 100% of the time.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's just take the example of soap because there is such a wide gap between - off the top of my head - natural honey propolis soap and synthetic detergents like the Dove white bar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best case for the \"Natural is better\" argument, stated scientifically, is as follows:\n\n\"Natural products contain chemical compounds that will do less harm to the human body as opposed to the ingredients in synthetic compounds.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe substance itself will only affect the organism via chemical reaction. In other words, the soap and the human only interact chemically. There's not much physics involved in how soap will affect humans, health-wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's analyze that statement. What, exactly is in natural products? Organic chemical compounds are complicated (I took three units of Org Chem and loved it the way a boxer loves going 12 rounds: I loved the struggle.) and sometimes hard to identify. Some of these ingredients are not verified to be safe for human consumption, and indeed some chemicals may be harmful to us.\n\n \\- For example, honey propolis is bee saliva mixed with beeswax mixed with material the bees have gathered from sap, tree buds, and other botanical sources. These are typically created by someone with a bee farm in a grove somewhere. They don't have 100% control over the conditions of the surrounding flora, which affects the bees. What if the bee has infected saliva? What if the trees around the beehives were of different species, would that affect the soap? What if a few bees have a mutation that causes them to produce propolis that doesn't hold its shape? Will propolis produced in the winter be different from propolis produced in the spring? What if this year was especially warm and dry, will that affect the bees? The surrounding vegetation? What if the beehives on the hill produce different kinds of propolis than the beehives next to the river, will they be sold as the same honey propolis soap? All these things are tangled in the infinite complexity of nature. To tie all these questions up: **If the ingredients of the product change even a little bit due to the natural vagaries of nature, will the product still be beneficial for people?** Likely yes, but it's also ENTIRELY POSSIBLE that a small impurity in a batch will render a soap irritating and drying where it used to be moisturizing, or even render the entire thing useless.\n\n \\- What is included in Dove White bar? I grabbed this off their website. Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Aqua, Sodium Isethionate, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Glycerin, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Zinc Oxide, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Alumina, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Alcohol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool,  CI 77891\n\nIs it safe for humans? I personally don't know, but I know we have agencies breathing down the necks of these pharmaceutical companies and there are strict rules governing whether or not these chemicals can be used on humans. These have been verified as typically non-harmless to humans. Each compound on that list is characterized according to its use, makeup, and behavior. You can google these things. Lauric Acid produced in a chemical plant in Germany will be THE SAME as Lauric Acid produced in a chemical plant in Saudi Arabia. If the German formula was off by a couple of atoms, they wouldn't be able to classify it as Lauric Acid: It would be something different. (Fun Fact: This is how some athletes get around performance enhancing drug prohibitions: If you change a couple of atoms in the right way, the effect of the chemical remains unchanged, but the identity of the chemical is - for all scientific intents and purposes - completely distinct from the original.) That means EVERY BAR of EVERY BATCH of Dove White Bar made using this formula will be EXACTLY THE SAME and will have EXACTLY THE SAME effect on a specific person. The behavior of the chemical mixture is predictable, and has been determined by a competent agency (The FDA?) to be typically harmless for humans. If a product fails this last criterion, it is typically not put out for sale because it's UNSAFE for people and thus never sees the light of day. If the FDA discovers that two usually safe ingredients interact in a way that harms a person when the product is used, guess what? They have that product pulled so it doesn't hurt people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we have natural products whose ingredients vary from batch to batch and are at the whim of the infinite, unimaginable complexity of the universe versus synthetic compounds which are clearly defined and characterized, behave predictably in the conditions they are designed to be used in, and have been verified to have a specific set of effects on a human organism, all of which have been determined by the ingredients used in these products to be safe for human use by a competent overseeing organization which is screening all these products and removing all harmful ingredients and chemicals as soon as they are discovered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow then do you make the case that Natural is Better 100% of the time? You can literally design these substances - almost atom by atom - to SPECIFICALLY only be beneficial to humans. Do not dismiss science out of hand. Always have a reason to make any statement.",

        "body": "You'll probably disagree with me, but I just trust natural things a bit more. Provided they have been sourced responsibly and all that. I feel they are more likely to cause less long term harm than something made in a laboratory. Even if something is made in a laboratory and tested, there is chance we learn something else about it down the road that is actually harmful. Like with aspirin. It's a synthetic derivative meant to be like the natural forms of aspirin you get from Willow trees and the like. It was shown to be safe and was even touted under the whole \"an aspirin a day keeps the doctor away\" but years later they found out that healthy people could actually be harming themselves by taking it daily. I also sort of view it like juice. Orange juice with pulp is better than no pulp because the fiber and extra nutrition from pulp helps you break down the sugar better. No pulp means your really just drinking sugar. I think lab created synthetics are probably fine, but natural ones that include the other things with the one you want might be more beneficial. That and natural ones generally help the native people who knew of the drug first to profit from it for their knowledge. I really frown on drug companies that find the natural form and then make their own to keep profits for themselves, and the book Tales of the Shaman's Apprentice talks about that a lot. Written in 1993 and is nonfiction it's about a man studying medical plants in tribes that are still pretty untouched by society. Definitely a good read.",

If I’d realised in advance I’d have hoarded it. I’m in Australia and can only find US eBay resellers now. \n\nI loved this cleanser because it made my skin feel clean but not TOO CLEAN and soft, brightened and evened out my skin tone, and never caused redness. I’m looking for a similar replacement, does anybody have any ideas? \n\nHere’s some more info that may help:\n\n- combination skin — nose can be oily, cheeks can be dry \n- I think kaolin may be the ingredient my skin responded so well to, as my skin also really likes Lush’s Angels on Bare Skin (but I don’t want to use that every day). I’ve also generally responded well to salicylic acid and probiotic products.\n- I’m not actually prone to acne, a Sephora assistant recced this because I was trying to deal with a painful recurring pimple. That pimple is still occasionally recurring, I think it may actually be some kind of curse. My skin in general still noticeably improved so I continued using it.\n- My skin is moderately but unpredictably sensitive, I’m generally fine with fragrances and exfoliants but I think that benzyl alcohol specifically might cause redness and stinging. Phenoxyethanol, parabens, essential oils etc seem fine. \n- I prefer a cream, oil or milk cleanser. \n- Willing to spend up to about AU$40 (US$30). \n\nIngredients of this cleanser: *Active Ingredient: Salicylic Acid 2% Acne Aqua (Water, Eau), Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Bentonite, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Kaolin, Charcoal Powder, Chrysanthemum Parthenium Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Yogurt Extract, Mel (Honey, Miel), Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Quartz, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Tetrasodium EDTA, EDTA, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\nThanks for your help everybody!",

decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, there are many companies for example, The Ordinary that are making great products that are inexpensive. \n\nYour lucky you don’t really have acne prone skin so here’s the routine I’d recommend to you for blackhead:\n\nAM:\nGentle cleanser - I’d recommend CeraVe ($10.98)  \n\n\nSerum/Acids: For blackheads Id recommend - The Ordinary Niacinimide 10% + zinc 1% as its gentle and is known to un-clog pores. Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

If none of them cause breakouts, you can just alternate which one you use)   \n\n- e.l.f. daily face cleanser w/ purified water\n- philosophy purity made simple (this one is moisturizing)\n- fresh soy face cleanser (this one is mild and a good one to start with)\n\n**Deep Cleanser** (I would probably only use this 1-2 a week in place of your regular cleanser because they seem more harsh on your skin. I would wait to start these after you get used to a daily cleanser)  \n\n- pacifica kale detox deep cleaning face wash\n- purity the microdelivery exfoliating facial wash\n\n**Serum**\n\n- caudalie vinoperfect radiance serum \n\n**Moisturizers** (Pick one and use it morning and night) \n\n- pacifica dreamy youth day and night face cream\n- philosophy renewed hope in a jar (this one has great reviews, maybe start here)\n- caudalie vinosource moisturizing sorbet \n\n**Occlusive** (use this at night for dehydrated skin, damaged moisture barrier)  \n\n- Vaseline (You might already had this at home so you don't have to buy more things)\n- Facial oil (if you have olive oil, sunflower seed, argan oil, jojoba oil, etc, it might be a good place to start.) \n\n**DIY Masks** (You can make nice masks with stuff you might already have at home)  \n\n- Ground up oatmeal + honey + yogurt/milk. This makes my skin really moisturized and glowy. \n- plain yogurt or milk makes my skin look brighter and less dull\n- honey + green tea leaves\n- Turmeric powder. Add this to any of the above masks for a nice glow to your skin. (Skip if you're very pale because it might be too yellow) \n\n**Products to Try in the future**\n\n- Stridex pads in red box. It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun. You're young, but sun damage can really exacerbate all skincare issues down the road.",

    "body": "Did they recently change proraso green tube ingredient list?\nI bought proraso green tube shaving soap and it stings my face significantly. But since i've been using the bowl version for months, I thought some stinging was normal due to eucalyptus.\n\nSo I kept shaving with tube for weeks, powering through, telling myself maybe it was just my skin being more sensitive  because it's winter (skin is a bit drier) and i'm using differin gel that is known to cause irritation and increase skin sensitivity). \n\nNow, the tube now stings my face massively, but it's the only face product that does that. differin gel and benzoyl peroxyde don't stings my skin as much whereas they're known to be irritants. My face cleanser also has irritant in it (SLS), but it does't sting at all. Only proraso tube does.\nThat proraso pain is sharp, and I'm not talking about mild pain, I usually just power through but now it's been way higher with differin use.\n\nObviously I was thinking differin gel is the culprit, but the thing is that I've also noticed my right hand flaking and dry . It's asymetrical, my left hand is not flaking . The flaking is not just some dryness, i can peel of dead skin of my hand) and that's when it crossed my mind that maybe the soap is creating contact dermatitis, because I foam the soap in a bowl with my right hand and It's usually a bit of a mess and use that same hand and wrist to to keep the foaming soap from overflowing from the bowl that I hold with my left hand. I didn't notice until now, but usually this result in my right hand  being covered in soap for my whole shave. Also I shave with my right hand and although my palm is clean to hold the razor i've also noticed recently some residue of shaving soap on my wrist and back of my hand. \n\nAlso, the flaking of my hand is specific: it's the bottom of my wrist  for 1-2 inches and the back of my hand and fingers (my palm is dry with crevasses but not flaking, I assume my palm is thicker and thus harder to flake, especially given that I come in contact with the product only for  a few minutes). Which seem  to be the areas that are in contact with the soap.\n\nTo test if it's dermatitis, I've put some of that soap on my forearm, massage it into the skin, and then waited 30mins to washed it off. \n\nThe result is that the area on my forearm is now red, slightly stining but nothing compared to my face.\n\nSo i've looked into the ingredients list of soap and tube from https://shavingtime.co.uk/ and compared both. The tube has :  fragrance higher on the list (in the middle whereas it is at the bottom for the bowl), magnesium, sodium metasilicate   Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate (it's tetrasodium EDTA for bowl). I have no idea what cause my dermatitis, but now i know the tub is different from the bowl and has much higher concentration of fragrance (perfume) than the bowl.\n\n\n\n\nSo the conclusion i've come to is that i'm probably allergic to that soap. \nI post this to ask if anyone else also have dermatitis with proraso green soap tube, and also,  did they change the ingredient list?\n\nLastly, do you have recommandations for hypoallergenic, minimal ingredients shaving soap?\n\n**Tl;dr**: I think proraso shave tube triggers contact dermatitis on my face (and hands).\n\n**EDIT 1**: about flaking hands, I've had them for months but didn't pay attention because i'm a med student and use hand sanitizer regularly (especially in surgery where I wash with soap and OH sanitizer several times a day), so I thought it was just normal. But now i'm on holidays and it's spring (so i cant blame winter for dry hands), and my hands are flaking as much as usual, i'd say it's even worse probably because I do longer shaves on holidays so perhaps longer contact time with my hands)\n\n**edit 2**: i have an allergic background, tested positive for dustmite and birch tree 16 years ago (didn't get retested recently). And I took antihistaminic pills for months. So perhaps this have reduce my allergic reaction to only stinging. Also, yesterday I skipped my pill before bed, and my hands were flaking a bit more during the day.\n\n*edit 3**: the stinging on my face is also mixed a lot of itchiness, and it usually those signs usually start about 2min after Soap touch my face. (it's not instant stinging like alcohol). For comparison, 90°alcohol stings sharply even more than proraso but doesn't itch (maybe because it also evaporates so it would explain why it doenst itch).",

It was SO thick and sticky that I found it hard to apply to my hair. I was very interested to see if this would be the same, and also if it was curl enhancing. :)  Here's my review!\n\n**Basic Info** \n\nThis is what is listed on the product itself description-wise. \"Eco Styler Curl & Wave Styling Gel is a firm hold styling gel ideal for curly and wavy hair. It is weightless and provides gravity-defying hold for all styles. Eco Styler Curl & Wave Styling Gel is water-based and will provide moisture to help maintain healthy hair.\"   PS- this is the pink gel. :)\n \n**Ingredients** (as listed on product):\n\nWater, carbomer, hydrolyzed wheat protein, PVP, glycerin, triethanolamine, sodium hydroxymethylglycinate, polysorbate 20, tetrasodium EDTA, Fragrance, Love and pride.\n\n**Price**\n\nOn amazon, it is listed as $1.59 for 8 fl oz. Holy crap!\n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nThis is where I've been having difficulty.  I couldn't log onto to eco styler website because it has ecocoinc.com comes up as \"this site may harm your computer\".  When I searched for \"eco styler pink\" I came up with a lot more options than \"eco styler for curly and wavy hair\".  Just an FYI. :)\n\n**How to Use**\n\nPer the directions: \"Apply to dry or wet hair. Work desired amount through hair and style. \"\n\n**Pros**\n\nThe hold on this gel was marked as an 8 out of 10- and it was definitely true to that. A little goes a very long way! When I scrunched out the gel cast, it worked nicely.  It's CHEAP!  Also, this is alcohol and silicone free.  I also think it's a plus that it's a pretty pink. :)\n\n**Cons**\n\nThis gel, just like the other eco styler gel I had tried, was SUPER thick and sticky. I couldn't imagine trying to apply this to dry hair. I had to apply it to my soaking wet hair to even feel that it didn't pull at my curls when I scrunched and removed my hand.  I didn't like the methol-like smell of it either.  It definitely did NOT enhance my curls. In fact, I would say they made my normally 3b curls more into the type 2 category.  \n\n**Overall**\n\nI will revisit this in the summer when my hair doesn't need any curl enhancement. I think it's strong hold would work well at that time. For the winter months(right now), it's a bit too heavy for my fine curls.  ",

The difference I did notice was that the jar was translucent compared to the opaque white of the other two soaps I have from them. This might lead to UV oxidation if you leave it in the sun or it might not.\n\nThe scent is dominated by the pink peppercorn which I can only describe as a sweet kind of mild spice mixed in with loads of sugar. The other notes are there but very mild and I do not smell the rankincense and myrrh. It feels good to swtich up my routine with this scent. It is different and dare I say refreshing but not a daily scent. Definitely a holiday special.\n\nPerformance is great as always. Never felt like I was in danger of my razor slipping and cutting myself. Glide was excellent. If you're a fan of noble otter and want to spice up your routine this is the soap for you. It is not a soap you will use often though so keep that in mind.\n\nI do not have the accompanying aftershave but I imagine it to have the pink peppercorn dominant notes as well. Someone who has it feel free to post it so we can all learn about the experience. I used a horse hair shaving brush and my feather AS-D2 razor with astra blades as per my usual set up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns please leave a comment of DM me. Thank you.\n\nPS I don’t know how to attach a picture to my post 😕",

I’ve tried the extremes, with 6.5 with some tjickeners I got an uncomfortably thick mask. Stearic at 0.5% won’t do much on its own. I’d either really minimize the thickeners (which I don’t think will be sufficient) or use just enough or a little more BTMS to emulsify the oils (1/4 of oils, so if you have 12% oils, 3-4% for example). Hope it works!",
