Even more encouragingly – with MoCA presenting the sole exception, all neurological parameters measured showed improvements over baseline, albeit these were not statistically significant.

    "body": "My skin is dehydrated, acne prone, and way more on the dry side than oily.\n\nSo before you get the skinny, I would like to apologize that the photos aren't of a higher quality and the lighting isn't consistent throughout. I wasn't planning on sharing these photos and wanted to originally just keep a record for myself but after struggling for years with skincare I felt people should know!\n\n[My results with the OCM over a 5 day span and my shameless Thanksgiving makeup with fresh new skin!](http://i.imgur.com/uZGvglZ.jpg).\n\nWhat I do:\n\n**Morning**\n\n* Splash face with room temperature water\n\n* Moisturize with [almond oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3745346.htm)\n\n**Night**\n\n* Cleanse with [olive oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/4354382.htm) and a few drops of [pomegranate seed oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3778907.htm)\n\n* Gently swipe off with a clean microfiber cloth\n\n* Dampen my face very lightly\n\n* Apply a [pink grapefruit HA serum](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/7436406/7808032.htm) with a clean [foundation brush](http://www.eyeslipsface.com/elf/face/face_brushes/foundation_brush)\n\n* Wait 15 minutes for it to sink in\n\n* Moisturize with [almond oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3745346.htm) and [Elta MD Moisturizer](http://www.dermstore.com/product_Moisturizer_16018.htm)\n\nThen magical skin angels descend from the heavens and I wake up each morning to more flawless and downright healthy skin. I almost cried the 5th day when I realized I was going to be able to put on my BB cream for the first time without seeing flakes and red imperfections popping out all over the place and on Thanksgiving of all days! It felt/feels oh so good. \n\nI hope this can help anyone who is in a similar vein of skin issues or just give hope to others who are struggling. It is possible to find resolutions for even the most difficult skin. I love this subreddit dearly and do not know what I would have done without the priceless advice and knowledge you all provide.\n\nThank you for giving me my confidence back. I feel like a different person!\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Edit: This community is incredibly supportive and I can't even begin to tell you how bad my mouth hurts from smiling so much. Thank you all for the positive and inquisitive feedback!**\n\nTo add a little more information for those with dehydrated skin or those wishing to embark the OCM, I have just a couple of things to add (some of it I have already mentioned in the comments):\n\n* I recommend the following reading to help you choose oils and chemical exfoliants, especially those of you with dehydrated skin: [GoW's Skin Type Profiles](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/profiles.html), [GoW's Oil Sampling Kits by Skin Type](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/oils.html), [GoW's Oil Summaries](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html), [Dehydrated Skin Explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1akqed/dehydrated_skin_what_is_it_what_it_looks_like_and/), and [OCM Explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/). From here you should be able to make very well formulated guesses on where to start for all of your unique needs.\n\n* Stop touching your face and when you have to touch it make sure your hands/utensils are squeaky clean! Always wash your hands before your face routine, keep your oil bottles/nozzles clean, and if using any type of tool to aid your process make sure it is completely clean as well. If you wear makeup it is the same deal, keep those hands and tools clean!\n\n* It is wonderful if you feel my routine is the perfect starting point for your OCM endeavor but in no way do I want to imply that what I have implemented here is a universal answer for everyone with my same issues. The origins and present factors for one person's skin type (even if it is seemingly exactly the same as your own) are way too unique to just have one measly answer. Everyone does have to start somewhere though, so if you are feeling good about mimicking my routine all the power to you! But please keep trying if it isn't perfect quite yet. It can be a fun and interesting process if you let it be.\n\n* I believe you keep a longstanding and trying relationship with your skin. Sometimes it isn't the same from one week or month to the next and I think it is important to stay educated and attentive to what your specific needs are. Basically, keep building and customizing your skincare to fit your special circumstances as you go! Almost like adding more protein or fiber to your diet when your body calls for it, listen to your skin and don't be afraid to break your current routine. Also, don't be afraid if it isn't easy or doesn't seem perfect at first! Nothing is permanent and with enough trial, error, and research I feel confident anyone can find a solution for their issues.",

    "body": "When I heard about this new product line the other day, I decided to look at all the products and their formulations via SkinCarisma to see whether anything looked worth trying. A few products seemed promising, while others seemed... not so much. I thought since I'd already done all the work, I'd share my findings here!\n\nIn order approximately from most to least promising:\n\nBlemish Control Spot Treatment, 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide\n\n- **fungal acne safe!**\n- 5.5% is a higher concentration that necessary but shouldn't be too irritating\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both near end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (at end of ingred. list)\n- some nice **moisturizing** ingredients, including a good amount of squalane\n\nVitamin C Moisturizer\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 8th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (14th ingred.)\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane, lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- small amounts of cassia and green tea\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- advertises inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is last ingredient\n\nDark Spot Solution Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: polysorbate 20 (8th ingred.)\n- **niacinimide** is 2nd ingredient! brightening and anti-aging properties\n- advertises its inclusion of plankton extract but is 24th ingredient (also not much evidence that plankton extract does anything for skin besides moisturizing)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract  (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (last ingred.), citric acid (15th ingred.)\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- possible **allergen**: benzoyl alcohol\n- contains a lot of **silicones**\n\nRetinol Vitamin A Refining Moisturizer\n\n- amount of retinol isn't specified, but is placed 25th on ingredient list (you only need small amounts, 0.01% or more, to be effective, but need 0.5% or more for dramatic effects)\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.), polysorbate 20 (24th), cetyl palmitate (26th) \n- **retinol** has anti-acne, brightening, and anti-aging properties\n- other **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.), ceramide 3 (27th ingred.)\n- tons of aloe juice, good amount of squalane\n- small amounts of green tea and cassia\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- specifically advertises its inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is 26th (second last) on ingred. list\n\nOil-Free SPF 50 Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\n- broad spectrum\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl stearate (2nd ingredient), isopropyl palmitate (7th), PEG-100 stearate (8th)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.)\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: isopropyl palmitate (7th ingred.)\n- pretty small tube, only 50 mL\n\nFerulic Acid + Vitamins C and E Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for its vit C so is not a dupe for SkinCeuticals, but should still be effective\n- amounts of main ingredients not specified, however, vit C is the 5th ingredient, ferulic is 10th, vit E is 18th (second to last)\n- **brightening** ingredients: SAP\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E, citric acid, ferulic acid\n- citric acid (8th ingredient) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingredient)\n\nBio-Complex Moisturizer for Dry Skin\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- claim to have a \"high level\" of hyaluronic acid, and contains 2 kinds, but they're only 21st and 22nd on ingredient list\n- also super unclear on what their \"bio-moist complex\" is but if it comprises 20% of the product it must just be like, aloe and water and glycerin\n- but yeah, tons of aloe and glycerin, good amount of squalane, some other **moisturizing** ingredients, moderate amount of green tea extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (14th ingred.), vitamin E (23rd)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 5th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (13th ingred.), citric acid (10th)\n- contains **denatured alcohol** (3rd ingred.)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingred.)\n- HA is in the name and yet it's the last ingredient\n\nCharcoal Balancing Mask\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: PEG-100 stearate (9th ingred.), stearic acid (10th), glyceryl stearate (12th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- not sure how much charcoal is needed to be effective, but there may be a deceptively small amount in this, as it's the 16th ingredient and the product contains as much or more iron oxide as a colouring agent. also it lists \"charcoal powder\" and NOT \"activated charcoal powder\" so it may just be all-around useless.\n- advertises its use of hyaluronic acid yet it's the last ingredient \n- main mask component is **kaolin** clay (3rd ingred.)\n- 2 kinds of vitamin E (17th and 24th ingredients)\n- lots of aloe and some glycerin but not many other soothing or moisturizing ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: stearic acid (10th ingred.)\n\nHydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: contains polysorbate 80\n- claims to have 5 types of HA but I only counted 3: sodium hyaluronate, hydrolized HA, sodium acetylated hyaluronate (and they're all 18th or later in the ingredient list)\n- contains a TON of **silicone**, which seems like a poor choice to me, as HA should generally be applied earlier on in your routine and all that silicone will interfere with absorption of subsequent layers\n- no other notable or helpful ingredients, just a few **moisturizing** things like glycerin\n- more of a gel texture than a serum\n\nTriple-Peptide Eye Cream\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: stearic acid (3rd ingred.), glycol distearate (4th), shea butter (5th), ethylhexyl palmitate (8th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- peptides are last ingredient\n- contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) but is 18th ingredient and what little benefit that amount gives will deteriorate due to air exposure from jar packaging\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane and caffeine\n- small amounts of green tea and green algae extract\n- 5 potential **comedogens** but this likely won't matter for the eye region\n- if you look up this product on Amazon to examine yourself, note that the copyable list of ingredients in the Important Information section is actually the ingredient list for the Retinol Moisturizer, so use the ingredients listed in the product images\n\nHydrating Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.), pomegranate seed oil (14th), coconut oil (15th), olive fruit oil (16th), argan oil (17th), jojoba oil (18th), babassu seed oil (20th), moringa seed oil (21st), crambe seed oil (23rd)\n- 2 potential **comedogens**: coconut oil (15th ingred.), avocado oil (19th)\n- in addition to above listed plant oils, also contains chia seed oil, the only non-problematic one lol\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- **surfectants** used: decyl glucoside and glyceryl oleate\n\nOil-Free Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.)\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- micellar agents (**surfectants**) are decyl glucoside and glycerl oleate\n\nBlemish Control Oil-Free

In the US, ingredients in concentrations of 1% or lower can be listed in whatever order the manufacturer wants to use. You can sometimes tell where that <1% begins if the product contains phenoxyethanol, because that's approved for use in concentrations of up to 1% -- meaning things *after* that are either at 1% or under.\n\n(Also, 1% HA isn't unusual, nor is it necessarily ineffective; it's normally used at/in concentrations of 0.2-2%. TO often uses 2% because of their unofficial \"more is **always** better\" philosophy [looking at you, 10% niacinamide serum], but <2% can be beneficial, too!)\n\nThat said, you'd think there'd be little reason for Amazon to list a \"banner\" ingredient at the very end when/if they have the option to list it earlier/higher.",

    "body": "I've been making a \"shopping list\" in combing various sources from Doctor's Forums talking about how to treat various vaccine related syndromes, in the absence of any guidance, and how to detox from the vaccine, to various talks by scientists and doctors about prevention and early treatment of COVID-19. Whenever they go into recommendation mode, I grab my pen and write it down. No I don't have the supporting research on these products, but that's done easily enough if you want to know more about any particular item. This is a very select list, but could be added to or modified easily enough.\n\nI already have over half of everything on this list.\n\nJust offering it to be most helpful, whether you're single or double dose vaccinated or unvaccinated, since it makes little difference in the spread and contraction of the disease \\[see Israel\\] where it's always wise to be prepared and where it can be said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nHope you find it helpful to find everything in one place.\n\nQuality Multivitamin-Mineral Supplement Daily - to cover the basics, minimally.\n\nB12 (naturally derived entire B-complex, ideal).\n\nMethyltetrafolate or 5-MTHF (folate).\n\nGlutathione - 5-MTHF helps the body produce it I think. Check that - NAC does.\n\nAlpha Lipoic Acid - a chelating agent.\n\nNAC or N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine. precursor of Glutathione.\n\nNAD - nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Can get as a supplement, Tru Niagen, who have a patent on a related molecule that causes it to be produced in much larger quantities in the body.\n\nNMN - Nicotinamide Mononucleotide. Note: NMN and NAD are one of the only proven anti-ageing compounds, along with the type II diabetic drug Metformin. Mice lived up to like a THIRD longer lifespan. Both are fairly expensive not too too bad, but once you have it, you have the best of the best. Repairs telomeres. Very good thing to take with Aulterra, to get the DNA repairing and oscillating. Good for long life and a more youthful appearance.\n\nDMG - Dimethylglycine OR Betaine - Trimethylglycine. (detox agents), not an &/or but OR, one or the other.\n\nLysine. Great for vision-related issues.\n\nSelenium. Detox agent. Milk Thistle - also good for liver detox.\n\nEchinacea Purpurea - wards off upper respiratory viral infection.\n\nQuercetin - bioflavindoid and antioxident - also a **Zinc Ionophore**. Science > [https://youtu.be/ey10QMPW9Ic](https://youtu.be/ey10QMPW9Ic)\n\nVitamins D, C, Zinc, and A - which may bind to Ace 2 receptors and steal them away from the virus' spike, and vitamin K2.\n\nNote: Liposomal C is best. With covid symptom onset, could take 10 grams without getting diarrhea. Perfectly absorbed by the body. Almost as good as an IV dose.  C, like D, and Zinc, kicks covid ass.\n\nNote RE: Zinc: Zinc + Zinc ionophore ie: Quercetin, HCQ or IVM, works via inhibition of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (don't ask me). HALTS viral replication in other words.\n\nCopper - 2-3mg/day either chelated or glycinate. When taking regular Zinc it's important to take Copper as well to avoid anemia, which isn't good for Covid. Like Zinc, Copper is also a powerful anti-viral, and may function in the same way relative to Quercetin as Zinc, given their proximity on the periodic table.\n\nIron - to support hemoglobin and prevent anemia. Note: Stop taking it if you get covid, something I read somewhere that it could feed the virus' attack on hemoglobin.\n\nMagnesium - unless you're on a cholesterol lowering statin.\n\nResveratrol.\n\nPomegranate Seed Oil.\n\nCurcumin - Studies have shown that it's surprisingly effective as part of an early treatment protocol.\n\nMelatonin - powerful immunoregulator. Deeper sleep also boosts the immune system. Metabolized by the Pineal Gland. No worries about tolerance, etc. 3-5mg/night.\n\nAspirin - low dose, with covid, full dose (have on hand).\n\nGreen Tea ECGC.\n\nNascent Iodine. Super immune system and energy booster. Thyroid gland metabolizes it perfectly without any sort of dependency forming. Eats it like it made it itself.\n\nAulterra - from a company called Harmonic Innerprizes (I have no interest). Neutralization and elimination of graphene oxide nanoparticles from the vaccine (what the PEG or polyethylene glycol is for). Renders metals chemically inert.\n\nShilajit - Pure Himalayan - great brain detox.\n\nAny quality supplements or fruits and veggies with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant elements and properties. If God made it, eat it. If man made it, lay off, at least as much as possible. Will lose the taste and desire for it after a while, the processed foods.\n\n================================================================\n\nCOVID-19 Disease Medical Treatment - Prescriptions Needed from Dr. (to avoid hospitalization).\n\nNote: Omicron has altered the equation, without the risk that was incurred with Delta variant when this was written.\n\n**If you get covid** and test positive (at home tests coming soon), while this is almost certain to prevent a progression to the point of hospitalization (where risk of death is too high, since more often than not they're following the Fauci-NIH protocol for hospitals, which is outmoded and outdated and leads to intubation and death, as we know, where they're doing much the same things this time as they did last year - no TREATMENT), suggest getting your Doctor to prescribe:\n\nClarithromycin. - Best antibiotic with the best coverage and the lowest risk factor. Superior to Z-Pak or Doxycyline.\n\nFull dose Aspirin. (OTC) - Wards off thrombosis, well ahead of the curve. A further anti-clotting agent if symptoms worsen.\n\nColchicine - Largely unheard of, it's an anti-inflammatory generally prescribed for gout. Very effective and helpful. Doctor won't have a problem prescribing it.\n\nBudesonide, w Nebulizer. - Corticosteroid prescribed to asthmatics. 2 Oxford Studies showed a fully NINETY percent efficacy in preventing the need for hospitalization.\n\nPrednisone - Oral steroid. NOT Dexamethyzone which like Remdesivir is hard on the kidneys and leads to renal failure.\n\nRegeneron infusion, if needed. Best received within 8 days of symptom onset.\n\n@ Home O2, if needed. CPAP, for sleeping, with auto-feature that paces breathing, setting set at something like a 4 (no sleep lab, just temporary), from which it can step up and down within a range.\n\nZinc Sulphate - 120mg. Quercetin (Zinc Ionophore) - double your dosage to two 500's/day.\n\nIvermectin - if you can get it (there's a link below to actually be in a position to acquire it, particularly with a covid diagnosis).\n\nPulse Oximeter.  - for measuring Osat.\n\nThermometer - to monitor temperature.\n\nDo not just lie in bed getting sicker and sicker as the viral load increases. Some people when they present at emerge were sent home, only to return and die on a ventilator, unnecessarily.\n\nIf Regeneron isn't readily available due to Federal restrictions (they're doling it out and attempting to take over distribution from the States), you should be able to get it shipped in right away for an infusion.\n\nAnd that's that. No one should be dying, or getting medically murdered indirectly or directly through a lack of and deprivation of effective and early treatment, and prevention, due to the near exclusive emphasis on the vaccine \"countermeasures\" to the detriment of early and effective treatment and therapeutics.\n\nAnd if you've been vaccinated or twice vaccinated - this ought to help you with any detox regimen to ward off any adverse effects, either now or in the future. Brain fog. Lethargy?\n\nMay you be blessed (not blessed be),\n\nOO\n\nPoint of ref: [https://c19early.com/](https://c19early.com/)\n\nEdit to add: I made another, similar post in a comment in another thread, which includes detailed instructions for **nose (nasopharynx) and mouth hygiene**. Snoot spray, twice a day, in order to keep covid at bay.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qra3cy/sars\\_covid19\\_prevention\\_early\\_treatment\\_via\\_daily/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qra3cy/sars_covid19_prevention_early_treatment_via_daily/)\n\n===============================================================\n\nEdit 2: Adding to List\n\nMonolaurin. from coconut.\n\nAstragalus.\n\n**Andrographis** \\- early covid treatment.\n\nAshwagandha.\n\nRed Reishi Mushroom.\n\nCapsaicin (Cayenne)\n\nOlive leaf extract\n\nNote: All these items don't need to be in a single 'stack' but could be used on a rotating stack, also for good health, longevity, and warding off any cancers which is becoming an epidemic itself these days and for all appearances, it's going to get worse. Encourage further research and examination of these.. nutraceuticals.\n\nMay you be blessed (not blessed be),\n\nOO\n\nEdit 3:\n\nAdding to list\n\nAllicin - the active ingredient in Garlic, stablized. Powerful anti-microbial, antibacterial and antiviral properties. Kills MRSA staphylococcus aureus fungal infection (Hospitals take note?). A must add item.\n\nEdit 4:\n\nElderberry.\n\nGinseng.\n\nGinkgo Biloba.\n\nOmega 3 fish oil.\n\nCalanus finmarchicus oil or Calanus Oil - Pure Astaxanthin ie: Super Krill Oil (not as strong) or Arctic Ruby Oil (the best - Calanus). Astaxanthin is the red in it, same with Krill Oil. Superior Omega 3.\n\nNote: These fatty-lipids form a large part of cell walls and thus bolster cellular heath and strength. Coconut oil is also good.\n\nProbiotics - the better the better.\n\nFull Spectrum Enzymes - same.\n\nFenugreek.\n\nFamotidine aka Pepcid AC - (with covid).\n\nOil of Oregano. - Taken daily - powerful anti-viral. Strongly recommended in little capsule form. Maybe produces a couple of oil of oregano burps but otherwise don't taste it strongly. You can tell it's potent though.\n\nC-60 Olive Oil. - Research this! It's amazing. That soccer ball shaped molecule will sweep up pathogens and toxins and allow the body to eliminate them. Super powerful detox.\n\nCannabis - Cannabinoids - not just CBD or THC (from smoking it), but the whole spectrum of over 100 cannabinoids ie: through edibles or a distilled tincture of some kind that does not use alcohol or anything destructive. See info on endocannabinoid system. Again, not CBD oil, which is just one cannabinoid of 120 or just THC (the active ingredient that gets people \"high\"). All indication is that this would have a powerful preventative and early treatment application as it relates to COVID-19 disease - and anti-cancer prevention and treatment, via the activation of that segment of the immune receptor system, the endocannabinoid system.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nI think it would be worth it but it's up to you obviously, to accumulate pretty much ALL this stuff, and use a kind of rotating stack to get it all in you. It's expensive, yeah, to a degree. I find however that once you start accumulating it, that it becomes like a hobby of sorts whereby getting a new product in is like a little Christmas gift, and the benefits are immense particularly if one adds in good diet, exercise, and more good diet, maybe supplemented with superfood smoothies every now and again. I call it medicinal food. Particularly for those over 40 and 50, regular food will leave you worn down, and susceptible to problems, including loss of energy and.. mojo. It's not enough to put back everything that's been lost and that the body just doesn't produce or extract any more in any meaningful quantity. Can't eat 5 large bowls of fruits and veggies every day!\n\nReplacing stuff and replenishing it, isn't so bad afterwards, cost wise, and after a while, you can start stretching it out, since it's not necessary to take everything every day.\n\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nI linked above to the Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide and how to use that. Weirdly powerful, that stuff. Probably because it cleanses parasites and bacteria, which the human body is infested with, and may be at the very root of most diseases or disorders, including cancer.\n\nNose Gygiene + Lung Cleanse - See > [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qra3cy/sars\\_covid19\\_prevention\\_early\\_treatment\\_via\\_daily/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qra3cy/sars_covid19_prevention_early_treatment_via_daily/)\n\nWater PH and purification is also important, to which a tiny amount of FGH202 can be added, even a little bit of ozone to oxygenate it. Over time, this will alter the PH of your urine and blood. To alter the PH of water, get a tester and just use a very small amount of Baking Soda.\n\nHomeostasis.\n\nDoctors will treat your body like a broken car, but true health involves getting the body into a healing and regenerative state, overall.\n\nGood **gut health** is also vital.\n\nNOTE: A few drops, up to maybe 7 or 8, later, of 33% Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide in an 8 ounce glass of water has an extraordinary property in being able to re-balance gut health.\n\nVid:  [https://youtu.be/vldZn1BQz0k](https://youtu.be/vldZn1BQz0k)\n\nI might even be beneficial to take an antibiotic, AND, replenish with probiotics simultaneously, to wipe out the bad bacteria and replace it with the good, to get it up to at least to an 80/20 split good/bad bacteria or 70/30 at min. Edit: It appears that 85/15 good/bad, is ideal. Suggest Apple Cider Vinegar every morning (can get in capsule form). And probiotics of course (already mentioned).\n\n**Liver**, the chemical factory. For cleansing and strengthening the liver, the main chemical factory, while **Red Reishi mushroom** is great, a product I'd recommend is called \"**Liver Master**\" (the main ingredient of which is **Milk Thistle**) by a company called PureTrim (where you take a course of it once or twice a year or two boxes of capsules each time, min, 3 max). I have no vested interest. It uses a Mediterranean formula, by an accredited Doctor, and is a great detox. Fairly gentle and not hazardous like chelation, but if you need to eliminate toxins, it works and it may cause you poops to sting the anus a bit for a few days, after which that stops, so you know it works. It does. Liver detox is vital, or you're kind of wasting your money on all the supplements to a degree.\n\nThere's only one more product idea that's surfaced which someone shared with me, that's worth adding to this list.\n\n**Bovine Colostrum** (if you're not allergic to milk) - powerful immune system booster. That'll give you actual antibodies and wipe out bad bacteria and viruses that cause disease.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdding to list\n\nPelargonium Sidoides aka **Umcka** \\- effective and proven (w clinical studies) antiviral remedy for cold and flu viruses.\n\nEdit to add, particularly for those on a budget\n\n**Fire Cider** [https://homesteadandchill.com/how-to-make-fire-cider-for-immune-health/](https://homesteadandchill.com/how-to-make-fire-cider-for-immune-health/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Vax Detox** Update/Note Nov 14th, '21: It's been determined from multiple sources, including Doctors treating vaccine syndromes, that the drug **Ivermectin**, is highly effective for vaccine detox and wiping the spike proteins out of the body, having a number of applicable mechanisms of action.\n\nHow to get Ivermectin: [https://covid19criticalcare.com/ivermectin-in-covid-19/how-to-get-ivermectin/](https://covid19criticalcare.com/ivermectin-in-covid-19/how-to-get-ivermectin/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAdding: Mullein Leaf  (Verbascum thapsus) extract. Like Elderberry, good for the respiratory tract, also has antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral properties.\n\nSince some of these things are for actual respiratory viral and bacterial disease treatment, just having it in you at half or even a quarter of the recommended dosage, ought to function as a powerful preventative measure, while enhancing your health and breathing.\n\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nWhile we're on that - Top 5 herbal supplements for lungs and respiratory infection, including both bacterial and viral.\n\nElderberry - check (already got it)\n\nMullein Leaf - check, just mentioned\n\nGinseng - check\n\nAstragalus - check\n\nEucalyptus - new. is that a supplement too? No. Essential oil only. Not for consumption.\n\nSince that's come up, **highly recommend** getting a **cool mist diffuser** and using a food grade hydrogen peroxide concentration slightly more diluted than that described here in the link below, or using the .1 (point one or 1/10 of 1%) described earlier for the nebulizer (with a touch of pink Himalayan salt).\n\n[https://www.leaf.tv/articles/hydrogen-peroxide-therapy-using-a-cool-mist-humidifier/](https://www.leaf.tv/articles/hydrogen-peroxide-therapy-using-a-cool-mist-humidifier/)\n\nTo this, I would then add fresh drops of the Eucalyptus essential oil, along with a drop or two of Ravensara Aromatica, the most powerful anti-viral of the essential oils, and 1 or 2 drops of Frankincense, which is a lung and gastrointestinal tract cleanser AND an immune system booster.\n\nSo if you really can't afford the other stuff, except the basic vitamins widely recommended ie: Zinc, D, C, this is what I'd recommend the most, to have that in your home. Very affordable. I prefer the intermittent ones to make the water preparation last longer.\n\nGet a cold or flu of any kind? Put that beside your bed first night.\n\nUsed periodically, however, as a preventative measure would be best, say once a day or every second day.\n\nNote: Nothing in this is about being terribly afraid of covid or afraid of it at all, but is all about the complete elimination of any such fear or anxiety, so as to be able to forget about it, while staying healthy with things like \"super cold\" going around and whatnot. Also highly anti-cancer, anti-disease, pro-superhealth, all of it.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Edit/Note: **Carbon 60 (C60) Olive Oil**, is I think, the most powerful detox and longevity thing I've discovered and for healing from the abuse of toxins, for years. 100ml or 3.5 Oz's is about $40-50.00. This should/could then be added or infused into MCT Oil, which is affordable in volume, & say added to a smoothie recipe.\n\nThe rats lived NINETY % longer! Not kidding.\n\n[https://www.sesres.com/what-is-c60-olive-oil/17387/](https://www.sesres.com/what-is-c60-olive-oil/17387/)\n\nOn top of NMN, NAD, and Metformin, for longevity, this is the greatest longevity molecule known to man, from what I can tell.\n\nAlso known as Buckminsterfullerene, for the soccer ball shape of the C-60 molecule. This is like the God supplement, shaped like the universe itself (some think). Roll these through your heart and liver, and you will live long and prosper! V\n\nNote: Most disease is inflammation related, and due in many ways to the body being a host to untold negative bacteria, fungi and parasites. Clear those out and the stage is set for homeostasis, and longevity, without disease. C60 Oil rolls them all in, then eliminates them. There's no escape for them. Vacuums them right up and away they go.\n\nCan't put a price on that, imho. Most highly recommended.\n\nBe blessed. Pay it forward! >\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAdding: Sarracenia Purpurea - Purple Pitcher Plant Herbal Extract.\n\nGrape Seed Extract - new major longevity molecule discovered in it, which dramatically extended the life of mice.

    "body": "Hi folks! My name is Britton, I have been perfuming, formulating and generally cooking up great skincare products since 2008. Blood Moon Botanica has been running since 2016. The land, seasons, folklore and a sense of place are what deeply influence my products. I always try my best to catch a feeling in a bottle.\n\nI am also a practicing herbalist, with certification and continuing education and I weave a lot of botanicals into my products as well as crafting seasonal herbal remedies and flower essences. I've been a long time soaper (that's what started this whole journey to begin with!) and have revived my soap-making practice in this last year. I offer up small batches seasonally. I utilize botanicals that I grow or source locally, and take a lot of pride and love in gathering drinkable wild spring water for my soaps (it fills me with GLEE).\n\nAnyway, I will introduce a handful of products that are my best sellers to give you a lil' taste of what you can expect from BMB.\n\n**Moon Dew Serum.** The first product for Blood Moon Botanica I made -- and for many folks, it's a holy grail. This is a light hyaluronic acid serum blended with aloe juice and rose water, along with many graceful aging botanicals for deep hydration. This is my best seller and most popular product. Reviews are live on my site, [and they speak for themselves](https://bloodmoonbotanica.com/products/moon-dew-hyaluronic-acid-serum?variant=40499848085711)!\n\n**Luminous Glow Facial Oil.** This is a rich serum like facial oil, infused with calendula blossoms and marshmallow root. It contains no filler oils, and is comprised of squalene, pomegranate seed oil, wild watermelon seed oil, sea buckthorn seed oil. \n\n**Ponderosa perfume oil**. I feel that this perfume blend really captures my perfuming style. Named after one of the greatest and most prolific conifer trees of the Western states, Ponderosa is that deeply rich spiced vanilla scent that you can smell when you sniff the tree bark (yes, really!) It's vanilla, spice, butterscotch, hints of pine and smoke.\n\n**Hand Dipped Incense.** I craft blends for my incense, rather than doing single notes (though I have had a lot of requests for single notes and will be adding some in the future). Many of the blends are quite heady, and I lean into comforting and nostalgic scents, as well as updating with seasonal blends as well. \n\nMy business is a one person show, queer owned, single mom gig. I will be very upfront that I strive to respond to emails as promptly as I can, though sometimes it can take me a few days. Shipping post seasonal updates goes fairly quickly at about a one week TAT. When I am not in seasonal update mode, I ship once a week. You can find my shop at [https://bloodmoonbotanica.com](https://bloodmoonbotanica.com) \n\nMy autumn update is coming **9/29, at 9AM PST** and I keep the shop open year round for my main line of perfumes, incense and skin care.\n\nI've lurked here for about a billion years, and have loved this community! I am a big supporter of other indie brands. IMAM has turned me on to so many wonderful businesses out there. I got approved to post here a while back, and have finally done it! Thanks so much for reading 🤍",

    "body": "Sharing my post here as well. Recently, I had posted requesting dupes for Bite's Agave Lip Mask as it is now being discontinued. This stuff is ride or die lip salvation for me. I live somewhere super dry, work in a dry environment, take meds that dry me out, you get the picture. I'm a moisture junkie. I gathered the piece that works is the lanolin in it so I tried some similar products and wrote some reviews of them.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It also got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. It's good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. It's a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. It's a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, it's going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!",

        "body": "First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair lip balm is my HG for dry lips. It’s a very thick, almost sticky, balm-mask. I usually have to warm a little of the product on my finger before applying it because it is so thick. It has a very slightly minty scent and a slight cooling sensation on application. It comes in a small tin, and one tin lasts me approximately a year of twice daily use. I also work in a hospital environment, and this is the only balm that has ever adequately protected my lips from the dry hospital air. It’s also currently $10 (half off) on their website. Thanks to you, I looked it up so I could post the ingredients and saw the sale so I’ll probably stock up on a little more!\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Cera Alba (Beeswax, Cire d'abeille), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Water/Aqua/Eau, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Aroma (Flavor), Urea, Mel (Honey, Miel), Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hydroxide, EDTA, Eugenol.",

I usually use whatever face lotion I'm using at night on my lips and then put my lanolips on. If my lips are really dry (I just got a crack today so will do tonight) I'll use some First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair cream on my lips then the Lanolips. This helps SO MUCH!

    "body": "Hey all!! I had posted not too long ago requesting help finding a dupe for my now discontinued lip balm, the Bite Agave Lip Mask. I took recommendations and compromised on some of my wishlist for ingredients, as I realized no one else makes a balm with an identical ingredient list. I figured in case anyone else is struggling with replacing this, I'd share what I found. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It too got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. Its good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. Its a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. Its a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, its going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!!",

The “Glycerol” product page title is a typo, as there is no glycerol in there.\n\n-\n\nRetinol & Niacinamide toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9b0a443774.html\n\n> Aqua, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Panthenol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyacetophenone, Parfum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jasminum Officinale Extract, Poloxamer 235, Retinol, Sodium Ascorbate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil, BHT, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, BHA, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Linalool, Coumarin. \n\nRetinol is quite low down but this has 5% Niacinamide, so it should be a good “lots of Niacinamide but not as hefty as 10% Niacinamide” product, replacing the Simple soothing toner which never specified the exact content but has been reformulated to have less active ingredient since I last tested it, so here are some new tests and ingredients: https://imgur.com/a/QJhFAxZ\n\n-\n\nRose & hyaluronic acid toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_65a8443777.html\n\n> Aqua, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sambucus Nigra Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Allantoin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Sodium PCA, Bisabolol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nRose oil http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8dcc443757.html\n\n> Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Parfum, Tocopherol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate.\n\nHappy to see there are no plastics or silicones in there. Like the Pixi one it’s mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, “sweet scented geranium”(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn’t sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to “not have pH” (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn’t buy the Pixi version as it’s still £17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around.

    "body": "Hello! Good morning, & how do you all do?\n\nToday I am going to be delving into skincare! In particular, the indie skincare brand, **Chikyu**. You can find the storefront on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Chikyu?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=572367388) as well as a personal business [website](https://chikyuskincare.com/). For thorough information about each ingredient & benefits please check the site listings. I haven’t even made a dent in the items I want to try from the catalog, but I feel as if I have acquired enough product (purchasing & through generous samples) that it was time to do reviews. Be prepared for a rave fest! Also I might break this up in different posts, to keep it from being a slog of reading.\n\nTAT was incredibly swift. The packaging is *the most* thoughtfully packaged item I have ordered from a skincare company. Everything was wrapped so delicately in tissue paper & securely, all secured with a beautiful knotted silky type rope. I have ordered three times now, & there has been a generous amount of sizable samples included each time! Before I even get into the quality of the product itself, I have to mention the quality of the containers & labeling. Absolutely as if you were ordering from a high end, big brand, but in my humble opinion, better than that! \n\nAbout my skincare, if it is of any use. As I have gotten older, my skin requirements have started to change, & I now consider myself in the mature skin category. I can get a mild breakout from time to time if I am on my cycle & irritate my skin at the same time, but it is not as sensitive as it was in my twenties. I do require products that are heavier in terms of moisturizing, & probably have for a while now without realizing it. My main issues are sebaceous filaments, milia on my cheeks, hyperpigmentation, & dry patches. Wrinkles I don’t see as an issue, just a part of aging, although I do want to be proactive at not accelerating them any quicker than need be.\n\nNow let the reviewing commence!!\n\n# Utsukushii “INDIGO Elixir” – Fortifying Night Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nIngredients: Rice Bran Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, Olive Squalane, Papaya Oil, Shiso-Yo (Japanese Perilla Oil), \\*White Chia Oil,\\*Coconut Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, , Blue Tansy, Jasminum Sambac, Vitamin E, Poris Cocos Mushroom, Marine Algae, Rice Ferment Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Pseudocollagen,\n\nAlright folks. This is *the* product that drew me into this brand in the first place. I had been searching for some time, for a blue tansy face serum or a balm. After some deliberation & searching this subreddit for past reviews, I actually found a raving review on this exact product & with communication from the OP I was confident in going in on a FS.\n\nAs you will find out with a lot of the products, this one is a staple in my routine now. The FS comes in a beautiful, quality glass dropper style bottle. The serum goes a long way, & while it feels very moisturizing, it is lightweight & sinks into the skin fairly quickly. The smell is slightly earthy, which I enjoy. It has a very soothing quality & it does not just sit on top of the face. I was worried about the coconut oil, but I am almost done with my first FS bottle (heavy handed use) & I have not had any adverse reactions to it. I do find that my hair tends to absorb the oils at night, but actually I feel as if it has been helping my dry hair so win/win! I apply this only at night, right after a bukachoil serum from another store. I recommend trying sample sizes or a trial size before committing to a FS though, because I did find I have a preference between three of the serums I have tried.\n\n# Indigo (Silk) Face Cream\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n30ml/1oz (Full Size)\n\n7.4ml/.25oz (Trial/Miniature Size)\n\n1.5ml (Sample Size/Skin Tester)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n\\*Calendula Hydrosol, Marula Oil, Prickly Pear Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, \\*Calendula Oil, \\*Rose Hip Oil, \\*Aloe Leaf, \\*Coconut Oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil, Witch Hazel, Sunflower Seed Oil, \\*White Willow Bark, \\*Neem Oil, Pseudocollagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Phyto Peptide Complex (Plant Based Peptides), Silk Amino Peptides, Blue Tansy (Moroccan Chamomile ESO), Klamath Blue Algae, Caprylic Triglyceride (Coconut based), Stearic Acid (Plant Sourced), Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Palmarosa Oil, May Chang fruit oil, Benzoin Resin oil, Cedarwood Bark Oil. Magnesium, NonGMO Soybean Germ Extract.\\*Rosemary ESO, Vitamin E, \\*Vegetable Glycerin, Radish Root ESO\n\nI had originally received this as a sample in my first order & ended up ordering a FS. I usually use a different brand of face moisturizer that I honestly prefer over this one. Although for reasons unknown to me, the shop never followed through with shipping out of my order & even though there were communications with the other shop owner, I still don’t know if I am getting my package or a refund as informed. Either way, with that in mind, I ordered a FS of this because as a replacement, this one fits the bill nicely & Chikyu is always extremely reliable. It doesn’t feel as moisturizing as my preferred, but it also doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry by any means. It isn’t greasy & absorbs fairly quickly. The size is in my opinion slightly smaller than I had imagined, but a little really does go a long way, especially if you are also using her other products. The container is quality glass like her other FS products. I think the price is reasonable though, because this one is packed full of vastly more beneficial ingredients comparatively. So I would definitely recommend this to someone who doesn’t like a heavy moisturizer. There is a mushroom moisturizer that I am more interested in trying, so before I finish this container, I will order a sample of that one to see if it is better suited for me. Until then I will continue to use this product.\n\n# Hakumai Mizu “Rice/Pearl” Face Cleanser\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar with Bamboo Fibers)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar without Bamboo Fibers)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Fermented Rice Water\\*, Coconut Oil\\*, Lavender Flower Extract\\*, Rose Hip Oil, Castor Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Matsutake Mushroom Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple Fruit Essence), Wild Burdock Root Extract\\*, Crushed Pearl Powder, Rice Ferment Peptides, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Bamboo Fibers, \\*Grey Sea Salt, Glucose (Sugar Based), Vitamin C, Vegetable Glycerin\\*, Sake, Stearic Acid (Plant Derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Gum, NataPres (Radish Root, Honeysuckle, Aspen Bark).\n\nI had also originally received a sample of this & ended up FS. I really love this cleanser. The sample does not come with the option for the bamboo fibers, & when I ordered a larger size I opted for the bamboo fibers. This is an extremely sizeable glass container for how little you need to use. It has a pearlescent sheen to it that is extremely beautiful. The bamboo fibers are delicate, but abrasive enough to scrub the skin without having to apply much pressure on your face when rubbing it in. I did notice that using this alone as a cleanser left my skin feeling stripped more than I would like. So with that in mind the next product I will review compliments this one. This is definitely a staple, but I am very curious about her other cleansers & plan on sampling the others to see if I have a preference. I am especially interested in the Matcha Cleanser.\n\n# Facial Cleansing Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 4oz (Full Size)\n\n1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Meadowfoam Oil, \\*Camellia Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Castor Oil, \\*Rose Geranium ESO, Multifruit BSC\n\nI love this cleansing oil. This is admittedly my first foray into double cleansing & boy do I feel like a dingus for not having done this before! In my opinion, if you use the rice/pearl cleanser, this one is a must to use beforehand. I have noticed with consistent use, that my face is left feeling more moisturized & better cleansed than if I had just used the other alone. A little goes a long way, the FS is a glass pump container that is sizeable. No matter what cleanser I use, I will always have this in my routine. The smell is delicate, & does not irritate my skin whatsoever. I highly recommend trying a sample of this product. The sample I originally ordered was enough to carry me through three weeks of heavy handed use. I have no plans on looking for another cleansing oil. I will continue to use this as long as Lyn sells it!\n\n# Kagayakimasu “GLOW” Face Elixir\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Watermelon Oil, \\*Cucumber Seed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, \\*Olive Oil, \\*Hemp Seed Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, \\*Tamanu Oil, Wheat Germ Oil,Geranium ESO, Lavender ESO, Grapefruit ESO, Pseudocollagen\n\nThe sample size container reminds me of my previous career in histopathology working with antibodies in immunohistochemistry. It’s a little flip top, sturdy, plastic container, but isn’t flat on the bottom. Something you would have in a rack while you pipette. Alright, I wanted to love this one. It smells absolutely gorgeous! But it felt way too heavy on my face, almost greasy. I am glad I only ordered a sample size of this, because I did start getting some clogged pores & small breakouts on my chin & forehead after using this one. I will mention that I had started my cycle right after trying this one, so that really could have been the culprit, but my face didn’t feel as irritated after I stopped using it. I just don’t feel like this one is for me & that is ok! I believe it is well loved by others here & obviously on her multiple reviews on both store sites. I plan on using up the sample on my décolletage‬ area & hands. \n\n# Liquid Moisture\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Cranberry Seed Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Marula Oil, Baobab Oil, \\*Pumpkin Seed Oil, \\*Borage Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Neroli ESO, Jasmine Grandiflorum Absolute, Jasmine Flowers, Pseudocollegen\n\nI ordered the trail size of this product & it comes in a cute little glass dropper style bottle. This serum specifically states on the listing that it will not clog pores & is intended for dry skin. I love this one just as much as the Indigo serum. I would say this is the lightest, in terms of weight & oiliness it leaves on the face compared to the other two. It feels as if it sinks in faster than the other two. I do prefer to use a bit more in my hand to get an even layer spread out, but it is perfect for adding it underneath my daily moisturizer. I only wear this one in the morning since it is so lightweight. I plan on purchasing a FS of this on my next order. Although I am curious about the Silk Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love everything about Chikyu. From the amazing customer service, the high quality & intention with each creation, the reliability of knowing I will receive my products & that the turn around time is consistently quick, & the fact that is actually making my skin feel better. In regards to my skincare needs, I have seen a significant reduction in the milia I usually have on my cheekbones, my dry patches that I tend to get on the sides of my nose/under eye area are not an issue, & with proper usage of cleansing & adequate moisturizing of my face, my blackhead/sebaceous filaments have become less apparent. I did not realize that I was over-cleansing & under-moisturizing my face before & that was what was making my pores look so raggedy & sad! Also, my hands have been feeling the love & are not scary lizard skin looking like before. They are soft & happy!! I highly, highly recommend at the very least, ordering some samples if you are curious. There is so much to try, that I am positive you will find something that works for you. If you made it this far, thank you for reading my thoughts!! I would absolutely love to hear about anyone else's experience with Chikyu products, especially ones I haven’t mentioned! I do have a lot more product samples I haven’t touched yet, & plan on leaving another review eventually! I tried to be thorough & I hope I didn't leave anything out! Have a nice day!",

    "body": "I haven't done a stand alone review/first impression post in a while. Cutting Edge Soap is a new artisan out of Arizona, and I thought I'd post my first impression thoughts in addition to those of /u/Dendj55, who reviewed this soap a couple of weeks ago. I had mentioned to a friend that I was curious about this new company, and he generously offered to send me his set as a PIF. \n\nI've not been able to find out a lot of information about Cutting Edge Soap. They have a [website](https://www.cuttingedgesoap.com), but not a lot of information about the artisan. The website does contain a section about how Cutting Edge Soap got started, which you can find [here](https://www.cuttingedgesoap.com/blog/background-info/).  The proprietor of Cutting Edge Soap credits Mo from Grooming Department, Tim at Mick's Grooming, and Ryan at Tallow & Steel for assistance and encouragement in developing his [product](https://www.cuttingedgesoap.com/blog/thank-you/).\n\nMaol Grooming is an established artisan from Canada, which is known for making excellent splashes. I don't know the story about how the two companies linked up for this endeavor, and I've not been able to find out any information in the brief few minutes of research I did. I would assume there is some connection between the two companies' owners, as it was a bit surprising to see an established artisan like Maol collaborate with a brand new soap company. \n\nThe soap appears to be no longer available on Cutting Edge Soap's website. You can view all eight of their current scent offerings [here](https://www.cuttingedgesoap.com/shaving-soap/). All of their regular offerings appear to be fairly basic scents like \"Evergreen & Cedar,\" \"Lemongrass & Lavender,\" and so forth. At $20 for a tub, the price seems fair.\n\nThe website lists the ingredients of the soap as follows: Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Castor Oil, Duck Tallow, Kokum Butter, Cocoa Butter, Mango Butter, Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Lanolin, Mirumiru Butter,  Gylcerin, Aloe Water, Xanthan Gum, Silk Peptides, Allentoin, Meadowfoam Oil, Vitamin E, Broccoli Seed Oil, Sucrose Cocoate, Punarnava, Silk Peptides, Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Lactate, Abyssinian Oil, Sunflower Lecithin, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Fragrance Stabilizer, Fragrance.\n\nThe soap is mid-firm, and has a bit of a orange/beige tint to it. I used a synthetic brush to load the soap, which is what I always do when testing new soaps, as I feel it's a bit more forgiving. I used a Pajeet-like method of starting with a fairly damp brush, loading fairly long, and adding water slowly to the puck. The lather on my brush during loading seemed quite foamy, and I was concerned. Foamy lather is usually bad news, but thankfully, the foam dissipated as I began to face lather.\n\nSoaps right now, especially elite level soaps, seem to be very thirsty. This soap, by contrast, was not very thirsty at all. I appreciated that it made it easy to get a nearly-dripping (lest I be trippin') lather built on my face very quickly. The lather was slick and dense, but did not have much of a sheen to it. I am not going to assign a score to it, but I will say that it fits very comfortably among high-quality soap bases currently available. All of the qualities one would look for in a soap base are certainly there, with slickness being very good, both primary and residual. \n\nThe scent is...interesting. The soap has a fairly light scent, and I actually enjoyed it more than I expected given my uncertainty smelling it from the puck.  Maol Grooming describes [Heliopteris](https://maolgrooming.com/product/heliopteris-aftershave/) as its take on a fougere, with \"hints of wood, earth, and spice. A very interesting and unique fragrance,\" having \"Egyptian Geranium, Egyptian Coriander, Marjoram, Cedarwood, Nutmeg, Patchouli, Atlas Cedarwood.\" It is interesting and unique. I went back and forth between thinking, yeah, I like this, and no, this isn't for me. I'm still not sure where I fall on the scent. I don't get a lot of sweetness, but instead I get more green notes, and a hint of bitterness, like the type of bitterness than comes from a grapefruit rind. Will I come back to this scent often? I don't know.  But, I'm a couple of hours post-shave, and I don't dislike it.  \n\nThis was my first time using a Maol aftershave. It has a very good reputation, and I would certainly agree that it's a fine product. It is a low alcohol splash, which is my favorite type. Drops of oil were visibly present in the splash upon splashing it into my palm, and that's a very good sign for me. I actually forgot to use a balm today in my rush out the door for work. Even though I forgot to use a balm, my face feels smooth and hydrated. That's probably the biggest compliment I can give.\n\nIn sum, Cutting Edge Soap's first offering fits nicely into the premium soap world. The slickness and lather quality is very good, and I enjoyed using the set today. Will I purchase more on my own? That remains to be seen. I'd like to see more interesting scent offerings, as basic Evergreen & Cedar type of scents aren't really something I want a lot of in my rotation. \n\nBrush: Dogwood Handcrafts Milkglass Timberwolf (purchased)\n\nRazor: Wolfman WR2 .95, WRH7 (purchased)\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp (purchased)\n\nSoap: Cutting Edge Soap/Maol Grooming Heliopteris (PIF)\n\nSplash: Maol Grooming Heliopteris (PIF)",

Tallow + Steel is also available through Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/).\n \nMorocco is a scent that harkens to the Atlas Mountains located in the Kingdom of Morocco. Morocco is in the northwest most region of Africa and is known for its famous spice markets, diverse culture and the countries natural beauty. Tallow + Steel has blended Rose, Oakmoss, Cedar, Cade and Cypress with the hope to evoke the thought of walking through a wild rose field on the mountain side. To my nose, this scent is dominated by the smokey cade. It opens with a punch and remains strong and forward. The cypress and cedar compliment the smokiness with earth tones and the rose, unfortunately is relegated to just hints. The scent strength is strong, both off the sample and remains strong once lathered. Soaps with a similar scent profile are: Mike's Natural Soaps Rose & Cedarwood and LA Shaving Soap Co. The Black Rose.\n\nThe performance of the reformulated T+S has firmly placed it in the upper echelon of available soap bases. In my experience, the soap loads effortlessly into the brush and lathering is a breeze. The cushion and density the soap produces is good, better than your average artisan soap. The slickness and residual slickness stand very close to the top of the spectrum. The razor’s edge glides effortlessly whether its on my face or my head. The post shave is also near the top of the spectrum as well. My skin is left feeling soft and smooth with no need for a post shave. The ingredients list is stellar, containing Stearic Acid, Water, Organic Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Tallow (Pasture-Raised), Essential Oils, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Pomegranate Seed Oil, Organic Macadamia Nut Oil, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Avocado Oil, Organic Castor Oil, Bentonite Clay, Organic Tamanu Oil, Vitamin E and silk. This soap base gets a shavescore of 90. This places it in line with high end soaps such as Oleo Soapworks and Australian Private Reserve.  \n\n---\n\n ****Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, \nsponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Tallow + Steel Morocco (purchased)\n\n* Brush -​ Mocek “Maul” (purchased)\n\n* Razor - SR “Bismark” (purchased)\n\n* Post - Jeeves of Hudson St Abyss (gift)\f",

I think part of the reason for that was the scent profile seemed to be separated between the soap and a/s. \n\nThe soap was mainly castorum and some of the milder scents, while the a/s was the coffee and rye, but when you put them together they created a warm, kind of sweet scent that made you feel like you were cuddling in a nice warm fur blanket by a fire drinking a hot coffee with some rye for flavour. \n\nGives me chills just thinking about it, and for once makes me happy that I live in Canada and can actually get a le soap.

They sport a very good soap base and a range of bold and unique scents. Their 2017 reformulation and new scent roll out appears to have been very successful given the amount of times I see their products in shaves of the day photos. While I have reviewed nearly all of their new scents, it is worth mentioning again that T+S remains committed to using premium, organic ingredients and donates a portion of sales to various charities that support each scents theme. Tallow + Steel is also available through Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/).\n \nWest Coast IPA was a limited edition soap run and aimed to evoke the sensation of shaving with popular West Coast style IPA beer. These beers are known for their bitter hoppiness and bright, sharp citrus punch. As such, T+S West Coast IPA features notes of American hops, pine, grapefruit, tangerine, orange and lemon. To my nose, the scent opens with a strong grapefruit note before being met with pine and hops. As with nearly all of the latest scents from T+S, this scent is polarizing. Fortunately, I enjoy this one quite a bit. It truly captures the essence of a fresh poured IPA. Scent strength is strong off the container and becomes mid-strong once lathered. While this scent is very unique, the closest similarities in the wet shaving world I can think of are; Declaration/Chatillon Lux Forth & Pine and Viking Shaving Soap Longship.\n \nThe performance of the reformulated T+S has firmly placed it in the upper echelon of available soap bases.

Tallow + Steel (https://tallowandsteel.com) took an already good soap base and improved on it in every way. They also took time to up their packaging game and come up with an entirely new line of scents. The new scents have been met with two diverse opinions. Many love the new offerings, while the other faction is highly disappointed. I previously reviewed Maya (https://youtu.be/n70MydmnGN4) and Himalya (https://youtu.be/9VfVL2521qU) and was not overly impressed with either scent. Tallow + Steel is also available through Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/).\n \nBoreal is named for the Boreal Forest of Canada. This circumpolar region of the northern hemisphere features a large variety of conifers so it’s no surprise that the soap contains several woody notes. The notes are listed as: Cedar, Fir, Spruce, Birch and Monarda. To my nose the scent opens with a blast of coniferous smells that are indistinguishable as to species. The scent develops into a more resinous accord rather than needles or cones. It is bold and unique among scents that utilize pines/firs and the like. The scent strength is strong off the container but moves to mid-strong once lathered. This scent is in the same realm as Mike’s Natural Pine & Cedarwood and Henri et Victoria Fall's Lumberjack.\n \nThe performance of the reformulated T+S has firmly placed it in the upper echelon of available soap bases. In my experience, the soap loads effortlessly into the brush and lathering is a breeze. The cushion and density the soap produces is good, better than your average artisan soap. The slickness and residual slickness stand very close to the top of the spectrum. The razor’s edge glides effortlessly whether its on my face or my head. The post shave is also near the top of the spectrum as well. My skin is left feeling soft and smooth with no need for a post shave. The ingredients list is stellar, containing Stearic Acid, Water, Organic Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Tallow (Pasture-Raised), Essential Oils, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Pomegranate Seed Oil, Organic Macadamia Nut Oil, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Avocado Oil, Organic Castor Oil, Bentonite Clay, Organic Tamanu Oil, Vitamin E and silk. This soap base gets a shavescore of 90. This places it in line with high end soaps such as Oleo Soapworks and Ariana & Evans.   \n\n---  \n\n ****Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, \nsponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Tallow + Steel Boreal sample (purchased)  \n\n* Brush - Declaration B3 Jefferson (loaner)\n\n* Razor -  Dovo “Bismarck” (gifted) \n\n* Post - Brut (purchased)",

I thought I’d put it in my suitcase, but after a pretty thorough search I've come to the conclusion that I left it at my parents’ house back in the States.  Woops!  Having them ship it to me is not an option since the shipping alone would cost over US$70 and take six to eight weeks to arrive (if it arrives at all).\n\nNot to worry, though!  I took stock of what I have on hand, and think with your help I can improvise a routine that will last until my next trip home in May.\n\nMy main skincare concerns are closed comedones on my forehead and jawline, SF’s on my nose, and the odd fine line here and there that I’d like to try to keep at bay as long as possible.  I live on the equator so I apply sunscreen to my face and neck every two hours, no exceptions.\n\nThe old routine that I had been using for quite a while, though I still struggle with the occasional comedone and SF’s:\n\n**AM**\n\nCerave hydrating cleanser\n\nSt. Ives Exfoliating pads (nose and forehead only)\n\nBP 2.5% (forehead and jawline only)\n\nCerave AM SPF30 (also carry a small container of this in my bag to reapply throughout the day)\n\n**PM**\n\nOCM 10%/90% Castor/Avocado oil\n\nBP2.5% (forehead and jawline only)\n\nArgan oil as a moisturizer\n\n**What I’ve got on hand:**\n\nOlive oil, coconut oil, and grapeseed oil that I’d brought for cooking (have never used any of these on my face)\n\n3 oz of avocado oil\n\n3 oz of argan oil\n\n1 oz each of rosehip seed oil and pomegranate seed oil (last minute splurges that never made it into the doomed ziplock)\n\n2 oz BP 2.5%\n\n2 tubes of Neutrogena baby sunscreen from a friend who’s headed back to the States\n\n**Can buy locally:**\n\nGreen tea\n\nHoney\n\nOatmeal\n\nCoffee\n\nVarious vinegars, though *not* apple cider vinegar\n\n**My questions:**\n\nSo far, I’ve finished patch testing the rosehip seed oil and pomegranate seed oil, and have begun experimenting with argan/rosehip/few drops pomegranate seed oil blends as a moisturizer (which my face seems to loooooove).  I’m going to start patch testing the grapeseed oil next, in hopes that I can mix it with the avocado oil in place of the castor oil. I’m planning to start carrying the Neutrogena baby sunscreen with me throughout the day instead of Cerave AM.\n\nIs there anything I can do to replace the function of my dwindling supply of BP 2.5% and St. Ives pads?  Using those products I’ve been able to hold most of the closed comedones and the worst of the SF’s at bay, but I’m concerned they’ll come back with a vengeance once my supply of those two products runs out.\n\nThanks for any/all suggestions you guys have!  I'll post an update once I have a new routine worked out.\n",

I probably got Candida from a mix of intense stress/traumatic events, existing gut/health problems, diet and antibiotics. I was tested positive with mouth/lip swaps, negative in stool tests but still had intense overall symptoms. If you're searching this sub for my username, you should find multiple posts from me containing everything I did and the problems I had. This post is going to be really long because I'll try to write down everything I would've wanted to know. \n\n  \nHaving a histamine intolerance made this reeally, really hard. I couldn't eat a lot for 6 months. My diet was strict. I cheated twice, once on my birthday and the other one on my anniversary with my partner with a lot of caution. (stevia instead of sugar, rice flour instead of wheat flour) I immediately got bad brainfog, but I still treated Candida in the end. Here is what I ate for 6 months: \n\n\n\nArtichokes, Asparagus, Bell Peppers, Bok Choi, Broccoli, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Celeriac, Celery, Chicory, Cucumber, Endive, Fennel, Lettuce, Radish, Romaine, Zucchini, Olives, Oat Bran, Millet (not a lot) ,Quinoa (not a lot), Butter, Macadamia, Chia seeds ,Pumpkin Seeds, Flax seeds, Basil, Cilantro (a little), Cloves, Coconut aminos, Cumin, Mint, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Sea salt, thyme, Coconut oil, olive oil, pumkin seed oil, Stevia, Herbal Tea. After about 3 months I started with blueberries, blackberries, currants, pomegranate, sour (green) apples, potatoes and brown rice (both had to be completely cold before eating, you can reheat).  I also ate the grainy things after 3 months and in moderation because of my Leaky Gut.\n\n\n\nI used the ebook from Lisa Richards, only did it much longer, than they write to do so, because it's way too short in the book. This was the most trustworthy and helpful resource on the way. \n\n  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1ajvhoh/any\\_thoughts\\_about\\_my\\_plan\\_candida\\_leaky\\_gut/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1ajvhoh/any_thoughts_about_my_plan_candida_leaky_gut/)\n\n  \nThis was my first plan. I tried many things, but a lot didn't work due to my bad histamine intolerance. At the end, I only did:\n\n  \n\\- 2mil Nystatin per day (only pills, couldn't do the drops because of histamine intolerance)\n\n\\- L-Glutamine rarely (rarely because of histamine intolerance)\n\n\\- Zinc (10g every 2ish days because this can get dangerous if you take too much)\n\n\\- 1 full teaspoon tumeric (also not more than that, maximum dosage)\n\n\\- Artichoke extract capsules\n\n\\- dandelion extract\n\n\\- linseed oil sometimes\n\n\\- a good probiotic \n\n\\- oregano oil (not too long, destroys good bacteria)\n\n\\- pomegranate seed oil in capsules\n\n\\- Zeolithe\n\n\\- homemade Kefir once in a while\n\n\\- bonebroth (rarely, because histamine)\n\n  \nI might have forgotten something. I slacked off with almost everything after a couple of months because it was very hard to time things correctly between medication and each other and I didn't have a lot of money to buy more. But I took Nystatin until the end. I needed financial help from a nonprofit to be able to do this treatment and in the end it cost me over 1k with everything listed, big stool test and other things needed. \n\n  \nI had a variety of symptoms. Brainfog, stool problems, burning during stool and in gut/after area, concentration issues, sleeping problems, irritability, flaky and chapped lips, small things almost like canker sores on my tongue, exhaustion, vaginal issues, ... I still have a lot of them, most of them. But I do have other chronic illnesses that can cause some of them and I know that there are other gut issues, we don't know what yet, but it's not Candida anymore. Might be celiac disease or other intolerances, probably still Leaky Gut. But the very intense irritability and brainfog/concentration issues decreased a lot. This was very bad. I couldn't have deep conversations and was very stressed all the time. I also feel a little more fit now. \n\n  \nThis was one of the hardest times of my life. After a couple of months of treatment I could understand why so many people are talking about being suicidal, giving up on treatment and so on. Which was hard for me at the beginning. So much uncertainty, not enough money, could eat almost nothing, my body was in so much stress and there was almost zero support and knowledge from my doctors, some of them even reproachful. I had to do the whole research and treatment plan myself, digging through subreddits, research and books for months until I had something that fit with histamine intolerance and my existing medication. No biofilm breakers, no strong antifungal from my doctor, no doctor/professional I could trust (and I really tried to find some in the whole country, I even asked Lisa Richards team in US) I felt hopeless. But it worked and I made it. I think my diet was crucial, honestly. I ate a lot of sugar before I got the news that I'm not positive anymore because I thought it came back and I was just so hopeless. But it was only vitamine b12 deficiency. It can cause similar problems in the lip area. I got another tests about two weeks ago because I got vb12 issues again and it still was negative, after months of eating \"normal\" again. Even though I eat a lot of starch and sugar, lots of grapes. I'm really grateful for that. \n\nI wish all of you a fast, long-lasting healing journey and hope you can find the real issues underneath candida or get the answer you need, if it really is candida or not. Seek help, do your research and don't trust everything you read. Use your support network and if you don't have one, search for people who can support you. You could start in this sub. Take time for yourself, try not to lose yourself in this topic completely and catch yourself, if you do so. Even if you can get out of it for 2 minutes or even just a couple of seconds and do something small and nice for yourself, it can do so much. This will pass. And caring for your mental health, doing nice things for yourself is as important as other treatment things are. Take care.\n\n  \n",

(Pills boost your serum b12 , and makes blood tests look in normal range, but your cells do not absorb it. Only active b12 tests are more accurate, and only b12 injections boost this properly).\n\nLow b12 causes low stomach acid, and low stomach acid reduces absoption of b12, so it's a vicious cycle.\n\nLow stomach acid also let's bacteria and candida grow in your gut.\n\nYou also need a strong immune system to keep candida in check. So treating any/all nutritional deficiencies is also key to a strong immune system and beating candida overgrowth. \n(Including folate, vit d, magnesium etc).",

The owner/operator, David Foulkrod began wet shaving several years ago and became obsessed with trying soaps and understanding what qualities worked best for him. After trying over 600 soaps, and testing soaps for several artisans, David decided to make his own soap, suited for his preferences. Cutting Edge Soap can be purchased direct from the company’s website.\n\nHeliopteris is a fragrance released by Maol Grooming. This is Maol’s take on the fougere genre of fragrance. Heliopteris features notes of; Egyptian Geranium, Egyptian Coriander, Marjoram, Cedarwood, Nutmeg, Patchouli and Atlas Cedarwood. The resulting fragrance is a slightly floral forward, spicy and herbaceous blend. This scent is a unique interpretation of the fougere genre and I appreciate the boldness behind it. Mrs. Ruds however, does not approve of this scent, for any use. She finds it too spicy to her delicate nose. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the soap container and remains this way for the entire shaving process.  Try That Soap ([https://trythatsoap.com/](https://trythatsoap.com/)) recommends Chatillon Lux /Storybook Soapworks La Forêt de Liguest as a similar scent profile.\n\nCutting Edge Soap’s base, called “Ultra Premium Shaving Soap” is a duck fat based formula that consists of the following ingredients:  Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Castor Oil, Duck Tallow, Kokum Butter, Cocoa Butter, Mango Butter, Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Lanolin, Mirumiru Butter,  Gylcerin, Aloe Water, Xanthan Gum, Silk Peptides, Allentoin, Meadowfoam Oil, Vitamin E, Broccoli Seed Oil, Sucrose Cocoate, Punarnava, Silk Peptides, Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Lactate, Abyssinian Oil, Sunflower Lecithin, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Fragrance Stabilizer, Fragrance. The base is mid firm and requires a normal load, although I recommend slow addition of water because too much too quick killed the lather in my testing. The base is fairly thirsty, but not overly thirsty. The resulting lather when dialed-in will remind you of cold sour cream. Visible lather slickness is excellent,  residual slickness is excellent. Post-shave is excellentand offers the luxury feeling of softness and silkiness that we’ve come to expect from high fat soap formulas. Given the experiences I’ve had with this soap base, Cutting Edge Soap “Ultra Premium Shaving Soap” receives a ShaveScore of 91. For similar performance in a soap base, I am reminded of Oleo Soapworks.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Cutting Edge Soap/Maol Grooming Heliopteris (PIF)\n* Brush - Mozingo Brushworks “Pure” (gift)\n* Razor - Worcester Razor Co. “Special” (purchased)\n* Post - Maol Grooming Heliopteris (PIF)",

Pomegranates (and PSO) was new information to me -- has anyone used this successfully?\n\n**Avocados**\n\nTurns out that avocado toast actually helps balance your hormones! It’s true - the plant sterols in avocados block excess estrogen absorption and promote progesterone production in women, making them super useful in your menopause pantry. A 2011 Iranian study comparing phytoestrogen therapy (soy + avocado) to HRT showed that the two therapies had identical results in reducing hot flashes -  by 42.5%. In addition, both therapies had similar reductions in depression, anxiety, and sleeplessness after two months of treatment – with NO side effects in the phytoestrogen group. In addition, the healthy fats in avocados work wonders on regulating insulin and promoting weight loss, as well as balancing stress hormones produced by the adrenals. \n\n**Flaxseed**\n\nFlaxseed has shown promise specifically in relation to managing hot flashes; in studies, a daily dose of 40g (about 4 Tbsp) taken over six weeks reduced hot flashes by 57%. Participants also reported an improvement in joint pain, mood, and “quality of life.”  It’s important to note that it is the ground or whole flaxseeds - not the oil – that seem to be most effective.  \n\n**Pomegranates and Pomegranate Seed Oil (PSO)**\n\nBecause of their dense phytoestrogen level, pomegranates, especially in the extract or oil form, are the subject of several recent studies on menopausal women. Improvements in hot flashes, sleep disorders, fatigue, and irritability were shown after four weeks of treatment (1,000mg of pomegranate seed oil). But just eating the fruit or drinking the juice has multiple benefits as well: it is a super antioxidant, with three times the amount of antioxidant power of either green tea or red wine; it reduces inflammation, fights breast cancer, reduces arthritis and joint pain, and improves memory. Oh, did I mention that one animal study even showed a decrease in visceral fat with prolonged ingestion of PSO? Even better: vaginal dryness was shown to improve by about 40%! This is promising indeed, as natural methods seem to be pretty effective across the board on hot flashes and mood, but I haven’t seen much at all about how to address the sexual side effects of menopause naturally.  \n\n [https://www.menopausetotalhealth.com/home/eating-for-menopause](https://www.menopausetotalhealth.com/home/eating-for-menopause)",

It's all a freakin balancing act, chia seeds, fibre, digestion, proteins, calcium, magnesium, nuts, fish, getting enough fruits & veg.  It's exhausting trying to balance it all. I do try and infuse fresh ground flax seed into whatever I'm eating but some days it takes more effort than I can give.  Haven't tried PSO, but am assuming that shit's expensive.",

I'm mixing in a 1 oz bottle.\n\n\nCarrier oil mixture:\n\n\n* 12 ml Jojoba oil\n* 12 ml Argan oil\n* 6 ml Pomegranate Seed oil\n\n\nI purchased a starter pack of essential oils. This pack had the best mix in my opinion:\n\n\n* Lemongrass\n* Tea Tree\n* Eucalyptus\n* Lavender\n* Orange\n* Peppermint\n* Cinnamon\n* Frankincense\n* Grapefruit\n* Bergamot\n* Rosemary\n* Clary Sage\n* Lime\n* Ylang Ylang\n\n\nCan my fellow W_S folks recommend a few scents based on the former essential oils? I am open to anything. Hopefully anyone can use this post to make their own oils/scents as well!\n\n**EDIT**: I'll also take recommendations for other scents with oils that I don't have listed!",

Now for some copy pasta.\n\n\"Take a scent strip (either purchased or hand-made), write the name of the component on the large end of the strip (if it has a large end) and put a small amount of your component on the small end. Take some time to try to get to know this component, and then go ahead and make other strips with your other components. \nHold groups of strips in your hand in a small fan and wave them lightly under your nose to catch the effect of their combined scent. \nWhen you feel that the strips in your hand produce a pleasing combination, then feel free to blend your diluted components into a small container. Ideally, your blend should be mostly base notes, to give your scent lasting power. But above all, have fun!\"\n\nHere's the web site. Sorry I couldn't hide the link in the text, I'm on my phone.

We’ve covered all of the Products I disliked so now we have one that I am pretty much neutral on LOL! Let’s dig in.\n\nThis medium weight Facial Oil is a decent blend of hydrating/nourishing Oils alongside some pretty great antioxidant Ingredients. Argan Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, and a whole host of Extracts including Pomegranate, Cranberry, Blueberry, Strawberry, Kiwi, Watermelon, Grape Seed, Camu Camu, Goji, Acia, and Sea Buckthorn all make the list. \n\nThis Antioxidant Facial Oil applies fairly well…spreading out over Skin pretty easily (although I tended to mix it with my Moisturizer after the first couple of weeks). Also, I personally didn’t notice any irritation, overly “greasy” feeling, or really any negative effects from it to be honest.\n\nWhich brings me to why I didn’t love it…I didn’t see many positive effects from it either. Heavier Products like the Peach & Lily Pure Beam Luxe Oil offer a lot more nourishment and a “rich feeling” effect along with a pretty intense glow (which some people really like). On the flip side, lighter/dry Oils like the Youth To The People Superberry Hydrate + Glow Oil are perfectly suited for Oily/Combination Skin types and pack in a ton of antioxidants as well.\n\nThis Oil from Mad Hippie just fell somewhere in-between and didn’t really “WOW” me in any particular way. The one thing that I can note is the Sweet Orange Oil used for fragrance is pretty apparent and gives this Product a slight (but not very long lasting) Pledge Surface Cleaner smell LOL! I know I’m coming after Mad Hippie for their scents but they are pretty odd.\n\nEven as I write this…I’m applying a drop or two every so often to my hand to see it in action a bit more. Each layer absorbs nicely, feels just fine, but doesn’t leave a brightening or softening effect. It’s just…there. And that’s the impression I’m left with. I don’t think I’ll be coming back.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Alright everyone, I’m done trashing Mad Hippie now LOL! The next 3 Products that I tried I actually didn’t mind at all. I still have others that I would recommend over them…but as far as the basics go they were fine. No spoilers though…stay tuned!\\*\\*\\*\n\nPS: I picked this Antioxidant Facial Oil up at Ulta for $24.99 USD\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsk2akrjrsj41.jpg?width=3939&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=709cab3ff958c66c9f00eb2c8e9eb7c4b2cb2f4c",

    "body": "Am wondering why radiation is such a prevalent treatment for a prostate cancer lesion versus other non radiation approaches (e.g. IRE (nanoknife), focal laser ablation). Especially given the lesion is somewhat accessible. With radiation, I understand you can have long term side effects.\n\nI dont understand why we cannot look at the genetic makeup of cells to determine their gleason score, versus \"eyeballing\" the pattern, and ascribing a score based on looking at the cells. Also, I assume cells dont neatly fit into a \"3\" or a \"4\", but presumably could be \"3.5\"? I assume a Doc looking at cells that could go either way (3 or 4) would lean towards a 4. And having a 4+3 or 3+4 determine treatment path is very scary when you could have a 4+3 simply because the core captures all the 4, and the tip of the 3, so its a 4+3, but if you had a longer core, it would have been 3+4.\n\nI have a 3+4 lesion (10% 4) and 3 other spots of 3+3 (10%, 10% and 5% of the core) so am thinking about what to do. My PSA has bobbed around between 2.8 and 4.2. My ideal scenario is to wait until I have to treat, then treat. Maybe tackle the index lesion and watch the prostate for any other \"4\" that comes up. Regarding the \"3\" - who cares - according to PCRI/Dr. Scholz. If \"3\" is harmless then I dont care about the \"3\". \n\nThis may sound silly, but I dont understand why you cannot go into the prostate and take out the lesion with a tiny scalpel. For skin cancer, you just cut it out. For potentially cancerous polyps in the colon, you just cut them off. \n\nMy view of standard of care is that it has to apply for the population as a whole. It has to apply for people that will just follow what the Doctor says, with no questions. But the standard of care does not apply to most people on here, that do their own research, ask questions etc.. You are effectively creating a care program that works for you, your risk level, knowledge of side effects etc..\n\nFor me, surgery is a huge step. To take out my prostate. To no longer have what the prostate provides! This is life changing for sure. My preferred approach is much more incremental. Take out the lesion, see how the prostate does going forward. Change my diet, start on some supplements e.g. pomegranate seed oil etc.. \n\nWe are getting cancer all the time. But most of the time the body kills off the cancer cells. From what I've read, 50% of all men have some level of prostate cancer. The word cancer is a label that strikes fear. Perhaps better to say 50% of men have some prostate cells that have damaged genetics/dna.\n\nI always want to get a second opinion. Irrespective of the expertise level of the first opinion. Mistakes happen. For me, my second MRI showed my prostate had shrunk in half, compared with the first MRI. The second Doc basically poo poo'd the read of the first MRI. (The first MRI led to the biopsy).\n\nThats all for now, thanks,  \n\n\n  \n\n\n",

It removed the cancer cells but left me with an otherwise intact prostate. I still have ejaculations. \n\nThe reason Dr. Scholz doesn't recommend surgery anymore is because the latest radiotherapies like CyberKnife and brachytherapy have just as good or better cure rates, but far fewer side effects. \n\nThe data is still coming in, but these advanced radiotherapies have fewer and less sever side effects, even years later. \n\nYou are right - surgery is a big deal. The people who talk about permanent ED, incontinence, and other problems is striking, and you don't see that with SBRT or brachy.

It's gelatinous. \n\nIt's the same reason you can't cut mold out of a soft cheese: because if you see mold in a soft cheese, that means the mold has already spread microscopically to the rest of the cheese even if that part isn't visible yet. That's why, in PCa it's so important whether it's \"contained in the capsule\".\n\nRegardless of whether you opt for a radiation or surgery based treatment, you have to take a \"huge step\". Because if you just take out the lesion (and there very likely may be more than one lesion) it will just be back. And 3 isn't harmless. Just because it's not \"we need to take it out today\" doesn't mean it's harmless.\n\nYou can choose what to do with your treatment. I'm not going to tell you want to do. But I don't think you are going to have much luck convincing a doctor to do something \"incremental\". Incremental approaches don't really work for Gleason 3+4. It's like cutting out the mold in a soft cheese. You can treat it, or you can ignore it. Or you can ask for a second opinion on the biopsy scoring. But there's no sense undergoing treatment that isn't going to fix the problem.\n\nAnd, realistically, you are very wrong about \"It has to apply for people that will just follow what the Doctor says, with no questions.\" Realistically, the vast majority of PCa patients ask a lot of questions. This isn't a broken bone, when you are dealing with cancer, the doctors are going to expect lots of questions and expect to tailor their approach for each individual patient.",

Here are a few scattered thoughts: I'm not a doctor but in your case I think your preferred strategy makes sense (have a focal treatment and then monitor, presumably a combo of PSA in all forms especially PSA density plus MRI). More experts are suggesting relabeling Gleason 3+3 as not cancer, they suggest the term IDLE (indolent lesions of epithelial origin), see JAMA article [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2829485](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2829485)\n\nRegarding surgery. I once asked a urologic surgeon why a focal prostatectomy was never done, and he said once you've gone that far in, it just makes sense to do a radical because if you missed microscopic cells and PCa recurs, you have to go back in again. However, in 2021 Henry Ford Hospital in Michigan published a case study of a \"precision prostatectomy\" (think of focal surgery with a scalpel). I haven't heard any more about it, here's the news article [https://www.henryford.com/news/2021/12/precision-prostatectomy-sp](https://www.henryford.com/news/2021/12/precision-prostatectomy-sp)\n\nRegarding your thought about genomic analysis, I've seen some recent studies suggesting that it is under utilized in urology/PCa. It's available, it's not that expensive, and I don't understand why it isn't routinely done to rule out known gene variants that make a cell line more dangerous. I have also read that more than one cell line can exist in the same gland. Wouldn't that complicate matters?\n\nNo matter what, I wish you total success with whatever you decide.",

When I apply this to my underage area, the area stays a bit greasy-feeling (for lack of a better way of putting it) and shiny for a bit longer than ideal, which of course then makes it a bit more prone to migrating or rubbing off when I sleep.  On my hands, it looks and feels wonderful -- under my eyes, different story.  Any suggestions for improving this aspect of the formulation?  Would the xanthan gum help in this regard?  Or is this going to be an issue no matter what I do given the high oil content?  Or maybe it's the high glycerin content?\n\nOr should I perhaps switch emulsifiers?

There are ways to minimize greasiness but there’s not much reason to put that much oil in the first place. I’d assume very thick consistency is not very usual to eye creams too. I would suggest really cutting down on oils (at least in half) and emulsifier, adding a gelling agent like xanthan gum for stability (percentage would depend on grade, a range should be listed by manufacturer, I think generally 0.3% does the trick).

In fact, the cocoa butter could be taken out entirely (might clog pores, really thickens too), while also cutting down on the flaxseed oil and pomegranate seed oil. In total, I would recommend 15% oils max. If you do this you would also have to lower the amount of emulsifier (I don’t know how much, you would calculate the amount you need with this one). \n\nXanthan gum would be good to give the product a little bit of a watery ‘bounce’ and stabilize the emulsion. I wanted to add that the 2% hyaluronic acid is a lot. Did you ad in the powder directly? If so, yeah, that’s a lot. 0.2% hyaluronic acid had been shown to be effective in hydrating the skin. So it I were you I would make a 1% hyaluronic acid solution and add the 1% solution in the formulas at like 20% or more. You could even use that as your water phase.\n\n10% tetrahexydecyl ascorbate is a LOT. The typical usage rate for this ingredient is usually 0.5 to 3%. And I usually see it used at 2%. This ingredient is expensive. :/ are you okay with using that much?\n\nSome people view 7% glycerin as being sticky, so that might also be effecting the skin feel. You could try to lower it to 3% or so. The problem with this and the amount of hyaluronic you used is that these to ingredients love water and your having the fight for so little water in the formula at such high amounts used. It’s not going to help your skin much.\n\nAre you going for a natural product? If not, I would recommend dimethicone or other silicones to improve skin feel. Esters like Ceylon alcohol, laurel laurate, ethylhexyl palmitate are also good. (Now that I think about it Laurel Laurate falls under natural...)\n\nThat’s all I can think of right now. Hope this helps a little.\n\n(Just wanted to note: Stearic acid is known to increase drag and you might no want that in your eye/face cream)",

I’ve been over exfoliating my skin since January not realizing it and now I’m covered in clogged pores, sebaceous filaments and closed comedones. \n\nMy skin looks dry/oily at the same time, lots of fine lines and looking back at pictures my skin looked plump and had no fine lines. In the morning my skin looks its best but by early afternoon it’s a mess. You can see every clogged pore and cc.

Maybe the microfiber, as gentle as it feels, is too much right now? \nPaula’s Choice Skin Recovery Toner \nSpray with glycerin/water \nPomegranate seed oil mixed with unrefined Shea butter  \nCerave healing ointment \n\nBefore you make suggestions regarding liquid gold or Hada Labo toners, I cant. I don’t know why but those products give me itchy blisters on my forehead. \n\nI do have other moisturizers, oils and toner vanicream, Cerave in the tub, Paula’s Choice redness relief toner, Rosehip seed oil, tamanu oil, jojoba oil, squalane oil and emu oil. \n\nI’m trying to figure out the best routine and in which order these products should go. \n\nI haven’t listed a sunscreen because I personally haven’t found one yet. I do not want to use any chemical sunscreen. I’m looking for a physical one, zinc oxide, that isn’t too rough and thick. The one I currently have is from Kabana organic skincare and it is awesome but it’s very thick, white and my face just can’t handle so much friction to blend it right now. \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!! I’m hoping come summer the high humidity will help with the healing process but in the meantime this cold, dry, windy weather is just making it so difficult for my skin to heal. ",

        "body": "For sunscreen, have you tried Dr. Jart's Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment SPF 30?  It's a physical sunscreen with both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (meaning you should have good coverage from both UVA and UVB rays).  It smells herby and pleasant but minimally so -- it's not a very strong scent but it definitely doesn't smell or feel like sunscreen.  It has a green tint to it and hasn't left me with a white cast (I am very fair-skinned, but I did have a white cast problem with the CeraVe face sunscreen I was using).  It feels moisturizing and goes on smoothly and blends in.  I got a sample of it in the Sephora Sun Safety kit and so far it is my frontrunner, though I plan to make my way through the rest of the kit before declaring anything \"HG\" worthy.\n\nFor the dryness, I'd recommend sleeping with a humidifier next to your bed.  That has made a huge difference for me in remedying \"winter skin.\"  I also have a rose water spray from Teddie Organics (on Amazon -- I haven't tried any other brands and so can't really compare, but I do like that one and have re-bought several times).  It feels very refreshing and I put it under moisturizer and you can spray it on as a light mist throughout the day and it doesn't mess up make-up.  I've also found that masks help, I had really dry skin in the dead of winter and tried a sheet mask that my mom had randomly bought me at Walmart for Christmas several years ago that had hyaluronic acid in it and it was like a god send (Soo Ae Deep Sea Water Collagen Essence Mask).  I did not re-buy that one because it's not on Amazon (I got some from the Creme Shop instead), but would try it again.\n\nYou might also consider the double-cleanse method.  Personally, I think it's difficult to get rid of any excess oil without washing my face with a gentle cleanser so I do the jojoba oil first and then a cleanser, followed by rose water and the rest of my routine.  I wonder if not using a cleanser leaves oil residue on your skin and can clog pores if left under the rest of a routine?\n\nIf nothing else works, I'd also recommend using Cetaphil moisturizer.  I was on Accutane in high school a while back and that was the only thing that would take care of the dry skin.  It feels heavy and creamy, so I'd only use it at night and not under make-up, but it takes care of business.\n\nHope this helps!!  I am still fairly new to this sub and am finding the more I learn, the more I realize how much more there is to learn, so if anyone more experienced finds a flaw in my advice please let me know, I'd love to learn if and where I am going wrong. :)",

        "body": "Hi, sorry for taking a while to respond. Your dermatologist is right that’s why your skin is acting up. I came to the realization that no single product was going to fix what I had done. I had spent so much money on various products trying to find my holy grail but it never happened. What I didn’t know then was that dehydrated/moisture barrie broken skin can’t hold on to water. It doesn’t matter how many watery layers you put on if your skin can’t hold onto water they’re useless. I’d get temporary relief by applying seven layers but that’s it. It wasn’t until I just left my face alone using only Finacea and a moisturizer did my skin repair itself. I also noticed my skin was super reactive during that time. So products that shouldn’t have bothered me were making me break out or have allergic reactions. \n\nIt was terrible so I completely understand. It may seem like your face wants more products and layers but I think in reality the best treatment is to keep it simple. 1 cleanser 1 moisturizer and no exfoliation that means even oil cleansing. I say no oil cleansing only because I know I would massage the crap out of my face trying to get rid of the clogged pores. If your anything like me just avoid it for a month or more. Remember the least amount of touching the better. I’m a picker so that’s been the hardest part to change but 3+ months in I think I am finally out of the habit. \n\n\nI hope that helps. If you have anymore questions just ask! 😊",

How has your skin been? Has the routine you described above been helpful? I have the PC skin recovery toner as well, but have been scared to introduce it yet, but my skin definitely needs a hydrating layer before moisturizer. I would love to know about your skin recovery journey. Thank you!",

I clean with a 10%/90% castor/avocado mix, then use BP 2.5%, and finally moisturize with a few drops of argan oil. So far I've been pretty happy with this routine, but now I'm wondering if there's anything I can add to help prevent fine lines/wrinkles.  I've read that apricot kernel oil, carrot seed oil and pomegranate seed oil might all work well, but once I started researching online I found so much info that I have a case of information overload.  Does anyone have any suggestions?\n\nAlso, should I add the oils to my cleaning mix, or the moisturizing mix I use afterwards?  Thanks!!\n\nEdit: My routine:\n\n**AM**\n\nOCM 10%/90% Castor/Avocado\n\nBP 2.5%\n\nCereVe AM (SPF 30)\n\n\n**PM**\n\nOCM 10%/90% Castor/Avocado\n\nBP 2.5%\n\nFew drops of argan oil\n",

I went to a salon last week to get my hair cut and the stylist used the Aveda Nutriplenish line of products (the stylers specifically) on my hair. \n\nFor reference: my hair is 4a, high porosity, very very dry \n\nI purchased the Nutriplenish styling products on Aveda’s website and I am in love with how my curls/coils came out, but after using them myself, I think I’m going to run out of product in like 4-5 wash and go’s. They’re too expensive to last so little. \n\nIt seems the star ingredients in the product in question (Daily Moisturizing Treatment) are the mango seed butter, coconut oil, and pomegranate seed oil. \n\nHas anyone here tried this product and has found an alternative for it? I welcome any and all suggestions! \n\nI have been looking for several days and haven’t found one that isn’t heavy (because of additional butters added) or that doesn’t contain Glycerin high on the ingredient list (my hair doesn’t get along with it I think).",

    "body": "Heyyy, first time poster here but longtime lurker!  So...I should have known better...BUT I added multiple products into my routine and now I don't know which one is breaking me out :(\n\nLittle info: I *think* I have combo skin but not totally sure.  My skin is never super dry or super oily.  But very acne prone in my T-zone (and sometimes a little oily) and then sometimes I have dry patches on my cheeks and around my nostrils.\n\nOk, anyway, so these are the products I've recently added:\n\nThe first is **IT Cosmetic's \"Your Skin but Better\" CC cream (SPF 50)**.  I bought this 3 days ago; I have used it 4 times.  I absolutely fell in love with it right away.  Perfect color match, love the coverage, and that it has SPF.\n\n\nHere is the ingredients list:\n\n\n*Water, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Magnesium Sulfate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Laurate, Stearic Acid, Calcium Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium Edta, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Niacinamide, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Cholesterol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Water, Lactobacillus/Honeysuckle Flower/Licorice Root/Morus Alba Root/Pueraria Lobata Root/Schizandra Chinensis Fruit/Scutellaria Baicalensis Root/Sophora Japonica Flower Extract Ferment Filtrate, Perfluorohexane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chrysanthemum Indicum Flower Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Perfluorodecalin, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sprout Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Pentafluoropropane, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Steareth-20, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Colloidal Oatmeal, Hydrolyzed Silk, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Tocopherol, Thiamine Hcl, Riboflavin, Retinyl Palmitate, Pantothenic Acid, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Niacin, Folic Acid, Chrysin, Carnitine Hcl, Biotin, Ascorbic Acid, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Chlorhexidine Digluconate. May Contain: Iron Oxides (Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499).*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next new product is **Jack Black Epic Moisture MP10 Nourishing Oil**  I've used a sample of this twice now.  2 days ago, I used my DE Babyfacial, which I also recently bought but I've used several samples of this before so I know it's not the culprit.  I do know, however, that the DE Marula Oil that they give you with the babyfacial *does* break me out so I didn't use it after the facial, like they suggest.  Instead, I grabbed the Jack Black sample and I loved it so much! It sunk in right away and just felt so good.  I did this at night then went to bed.  I then used it a second time, yesterday, during the day. BTW, yesterday is the day I noticed my break out.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate, Jojoba Esters, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Citrillus Ianatus (Watemelon) Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Prunus Insititia Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Fragrance (Parfum), Ascorbyl Palmitate, Retinyl Palmitate, Schinziophyton Rautanenii (Manketti) Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Citral, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third product I added is **Marc Jacob's Dew Drops Coconut Gel Highlighter**  I've only used this twice.  I wasn't a big fan.  \n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, Mica, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Tromethamine, Parfum/Fragrance, Lecithin, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Dimethiconol, Simethicone, Hexylene Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta, Tocopherol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Diisostearyl Malate, Butylene Glycol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Panthenol, Withania Somnifera Root Extract, Silica, Isostearyl Alcohol, Malic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Tin Oxide, Coumarin, Linalool, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491), Carmine (Ci 75470).*\n\n\n\nSooo, obviously I'm hoping that the MJ Highlighter is the culprit, since it's the most expensive and my least favorite. But, I have a feeling it's one of the first two :(\n\n\nIf you need any additional info, let me know! I'd love to figure out what it is that caused the breakout so I can continue to use the other products that don't break me out.",

    "body": "***TL;DR — This is your official permission slip to take care of you. No time, you say? Try Getting Ready with Soul — Alicia Keys’ twist on the viral GRWM trend — and slip some soulcare into your skincare routine.***\n\nThe New Year is a chance to hit refresh and reset — to reflect on what we want to let go of, and what we want to embrace. But taking time for ourselves doesn’t always come easy. Sometimes, we need a little reminder to give ourselves the soulcare we need. \n\nWhat is soulcare? It simply means taking care of your *whole* self. And it’s a philosophy Alicia Keys believes in deeply –  from her own experience learning to honor the connection between skin+soul.\n\nSo how does a busy mom, musician, creator and entrepreneur like Alicia find time for soulcare? Read on – and learn the simple way she turns her skincare routine into a soul-nurturing ritual.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1apcnmt/video/vk64vtj898ic1/player\n\n# YOU ARE DESERVING \n\nSoulcare doesn’t have to be complicated. Even a few minutes of focused time can have a huge impact on how you feel. The first step is to believe that you deserve it. \n\n>*“You are deserving, we are deserving. We really are. You are deserving of that time with just you, for you. I feel like sometimes we don't even know how to give ourselves the space to have any time for ourselves.” – Alicia*\n\nAlicia’s personal journey to finding her self-worth started early — as a young musician experiencing so much external pressure, feeling like she had to please everyone around her. And every bit of that stress showed up on her skin. After nearly experiencing an emotional breakdown on a photoshoot in 2006, Alicia realized she had to start putting herself first. \n\n>*“I let go of the urge to twist myself into a pretzel trying to live up to others expectations and began using the single most powerful word a pleaser can ever speak – no.” – Alicia*\n\nAlicia knows first-hand that ‘skin anxiety’ can get in the way of positivity and self-love. It was only when she began to take care of her whole self — inside and out — that things started to change. Learning to nourish her skin and nurture her soul was the key to unlocking her greatness, and celebrating the strength and beauty that was already inside of her. We get that, do you?\n\n>*“I think that the biggest thing that I really learned is having that relationship with yourself. So you know how to regulate these emotions or these stress factors. It's really one step to finding not only your peace, but your own inner beauty because it's coming from that space.”  – Alicia*\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1apcnmt/video/3e77iuzz98ic1/player\n\n# TURN ROUTINE INTO RITUAL\n\nRituals are really the heart of soulcare — the small moments we create for ourselves to remind us that we have control of our energy. For some it could be daily meditation, movement, or morning tea — but for the booked and busy, it can be as simple as pausing to take a deep breath and reminding yourself that you are enough. \n\n>*“Most of us take about 16 breaths per minute. That means we typically breathe 960 times an hour — so each day I have more than 23,000 opportunities to breathe my way into a new existence, one exhale at a time.” – Alicia*\n\nWhen it comes to skincare, rituals are how we honor the connection between skin + soul. How do you take that time you spend getting ready every day and supercharge it with soulcare? Try Getting Ready with Soul. If you haven’t seen it, #GRWSoul is Alicia’s spin on #GRWM — an easy way to transform your daily skincare routine into a soul-nurturing ritual. \n\n>*“Even the five minutes it takes to wash my face can make me feel more beautiful, more powerful, more possible.”  – Alicia*\n\nSo what’s the trick? Simply speaking kindly to yourself! Affirmations (a.k.a., intentionally loving self-talk) — said out loud or left on a Post-it note — are an easy way to shift your energy. Healing words have a positive impact on our mindset, which is why each of Keys Soulcare’s signature amethyst bottles features an [affirmation, personally written by Alicia](https://www.keyssoulcare.com/affirmation-finder.html). \n\n>*“I'm a big, big believer that we’ve got to speak what we want, even when we don't feel it, when we don't believe it. So each of our offerings have a super powerful mantra — something that you can read daily and hopefully say out loud.” – Alicia*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kdv2bm99a8ic1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1033446f84c3de62eec2f2518162fd7a496053f6\n\n# YOU ARE GOOD TO YOURSELF\n\nAlicia’s current favorite affirmation – *“I am good to myself”* – was written for our newest offering, [Deeply Replenishing Squalane Facial Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Keys-Soulcare-Squalane-Overnight-Complexion/dp/B0CN85SDW5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=HZCZMJBM0Q29&keywords=squalane+facial+oil+keys+soulcare&qid=1706021833&s=beauty&sprefix=squalane+facial+oil+keys+soulcar%2Cbeauty%2C280&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1), available exclusively on Amazon. The gentle but powerful formula Byrdie calls \"[a hydrating dream](https://www.byrdie.com/keys-soulcare-deeply-replenishing-facial-oil-launch-8430748)\" combines squalane with antioxidant pomegranate seed oil and prickly pear seed oil to support the skin's moisture barrier and hydrate skin overnight for a radiant, glowing complexion. Really. (In a four-week consumer perception test, 94% agreed skin was replenished and 97% agreed skin was softer the morning after use.)\n\n>*“This lightweight oil absorbs easily for a non-greasy feel everyone can feel comfortable using.” – Dr. Renée Snyder, Board-certified Dermatologist*\n\nFacial oil skeptics, fear not! With her notoriously reactive skin, Alicia had always been terrified of facial oils from past experiences with formulas that left her feeling “like a grease attack.” To ensure a safe, effective and non-greasy experience, Alicia worked closely with board-certified dermatologist Dr. Renée Snyder to create a gentle, multi-tasking, non-comedogenic formula that would allow even oily and acne-prone complexions to enjoy the uniquely nourishing, plumping, replenishing benefits.\n\n>*“You couldn’t have paid me to put oil on my face! But I am in LOVE with this one!” – Alicia*\n\nA big believer in the power of rest, Alicia loves using this dreamy facial oil as part of her nighttime ritual. Try it yourself! Getting ready (for bed) with soul is a simple way to release what doesn’t serve you and replenish both skin + soul. \n\n>*\"There is radical change possible with self-love. Soulcare is giving yourself time for yourself.\" – Alicia*\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1apcnmt/video/cjecoekfa8ic1/player\n\n# UNLOCKING TIME FOR SOULCARE \n\nWondering how much soulcare you need? We’ve got you. Check out our [Soulcare Calculator](https://www.keyssoulcare.com/soulcare-calculator.html) and rediscover the soulcare minutes missing in your day. Answer just a few simple questions, and we’ll calculate how much time you could reclaim for soulcare. \n\nFor those who can carve out more than a few minutes here and there for a hot bath, a good book, or a moment to sit and self reflect – good for you! But for the rest of us who can’t seem to find a single extra minute – remember, soulcare isn’t *another* thing to do, it’s really just treating yourself with love and kindness while you’re doing the things you already do. \n\nSo if you can only do one thing for yourself, try Getting Ready with Soul. The next time you wash your face or start your skincare routine: choose a favorite affirmation (or one of Alicia’s!), look yourself in the eye, and speak that affirmation out loud. It really will shift your energy. \n\n>*“It’s time to start creating more time for yourself.” – Alicia*\n\n*Need more inspo?

I'm not sure how long they've been there but I only really started to be bothered by them this summer. They are where my skin naturally gathers when I raise my eyebrows but stay even when my eyebrows are down. If I really inspect my face I guess I have other very fine lines but nothing that seem bothersome.\n\nEarly 30s; have been pretty good about sun protection after 1 very bad full-body burn as a teenager. Tend to have a \"very expressive\", active face/forehead and tension headaches from tension in face muscles.\n\nIs this normal aging and I should just either accept it or get Botox? Is this dehydration from AC and dehumidifiers all summer? Or could it be over-exfoliation (maybe I need to step down the retinoid %)?\n\nIf it's dehydration, is it because I'm using so many oil-based things and not toning to get water-based products down to the skin? Should I add another step/product to make sure moisture is getting in there?\n\nI've been doing oil-only cleansing for almost 2 years now and it has cleared up pretty much all my deep, painful hormonal acne and closed comedones. Before switching to this oil-only routine I was double-cleansing with jojoba oil and Avene Eau Thermale Clean-Ac Cleansing Cream or using micellar water, and then toning with Thayer's. I'm a little bit afraid of cleansers and toners now, and avoid all detergents/surfactants, fatty alcohols, silicones, limonene and other citrus-derived products, and glycerin.

I got really sick about two years ago and lost a lot of weight and hair, also had really negative skin reactions which made them deepen and appear easier. I have since upped my hydration game and they are less noticeable, but still very much there. You could do botox if you want, it's really only worth doing before you're in your 40-50s because you want to do it before the wrinkles create permanent creases that are there even when you aren't raising your eyebrows. Once they're there, there is no undoing them without more intensive treatments and procedures. However, it's not something to do lightly and you should definitely go consult with a derm or plastic surgeon to figure out what's best for you. \n\nMy personal opinion is that you are probably gorgeous and the only one who notices the lines the way you do. If you feel really self conscious about it, do something about it. If you think you can try to alter your routine to see if it helps first, try that. Nobody knows what's right for you and your skin except you and perhaps your doctor who is really aware of your concerns and what you've tried to alleviate them.

I'm excited to work with NaOH again since the last time was in chem lab in undergrad!) so decided to throw in a mix with what I already have. I want a bar that is conditioning, non-drying (I live in NM and it’s soo dry here), and also cleansing. \n\nI know coconut and palm are the usual go-to’s for a bar for their cleansing abilities and hardness factors but I would like to stay away from both of these. Coconut makes my skin itch and break out (not allergic just super acne prone), and I don’t want to contribute to any unsustainable practices so am choosing to stay away from palm! I also am a Hindu vegetarian so definitely no animal products (I know lard and tallow are common soaping ingredients but obviously dont want those in my soap) except ghee but I don’t want ghee in my soap lol. \n\nSo does this recipe look ok to y’all? If anything looks off with the oils I also have these available: hemp seed oil, argan oil, black cumin seed oil, sea buckthorn oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil, borage oil, camellia oil, passion fruit oil, evening primrose oil, marula oil, moringa oil, pomegranate seed oil, rose hip seed oil, and tamanu oil. I know this is a pretty bougie list but like I said I have a lot of oils available to me since I formulate for a skincare brand 🤗\n\n\\*\\*RECIPE\\*\\* (idk how to post a pic and a text post at the same time)\n\nWater as total percentage = 33%\n\nSuperfat = 5% (should I go higher but I dont want a slimy bar??)\n\nNaOH concentration = 29.144% and water to lye ration is 2.43:1\n\nAvocado oil - 18%\n\nBabassu oil - 22%\n\nCastor oil - 5%\n\nOlive oil - 17%\n\nMango butter - 5%\n\nKokum butter - 5%\n\nShea butter - 5%\n\nNeem Oil - 5%\n\nGrapeseed oil - 7%\n\nSweet almond oil - 11%\n\nSoapCalc metrics: Hardness=37 | Cleansing =16 | Conditioning=60 | Bubbly=21 | Creamy=26 | Iodine=68 | INS=133 |\n\nFatty acid composition: Lauric=11 | Myristic=5 | Palmitic=11 | Stearic=10 | Ricinoleic=5 | Oleic=42 | Linoleic=12 | Linolenic=0 |\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help is super appreciated, thank you all so much!!!",

        "body": "Any reason why you want all the different butters, neem, avocado and grapeseed? I ask because, when you are making soap, you have to be aware that most if not all the proporties that a lot of oils have before saponification will not be there in the end product, and you are better off using them on the products that you already make. I wouldnt add any other oils pf your list either for that same reason. Except maybe sunflower if its high oleic, if not, it tends to go rancid rather quickly. Same with grapeseed so i would just skip that one too. \n\nAlso is better to calculate your lye as concentration and not as % of oils, since it wont give you consistent results. \n\nAs for the recipe i would probably take out all the butters except shea and bump that one up to around 15. Add more olive, probably less avocado, at around 10 or 15. Your babassu is gonna be there to basically replace the coconut, but i never used it so I am not quite sure how stripping it is, i would still probably lower it to 20, like coconut. \n\n\nhttps://classicbells.com/soap/soapyStuff.asp\n\nThat site is full of information about soapmaking, including what the numbers in the calc mean and what the oils do in soap, i recomend you check it out before comiting to a recipe.",

    "body": "After a 3 year hiatus, I've decided to start making my own skincare products again.\n\nI wanted to start of with a moisturizer that mainly focuses on sun damage repair/protection and locking in moisture (I currently live in a very sunny place and the tap water really dries out my skin lol).\n\nBut I'm having trouble developing a recipe.\n\nMostly, because I now have like 5 ingredients that could help with dry/irritated skin ( ectoin, pentavitin, hyaluronic acid, panthenol, allantoin)  and I just can't figure out if adding all of them would be overkill or if it would have an adverse effect. Or maybe it's the best idea ever.\n\nSo I was wondering how many actives would you say is enough per formula? Because these were just the \"moisturizing\" actives. There's still a handful more for the sun damage part. \n\nWhich then also made me wonder... how do *you* approach formulating? \n\nE.g.  \nDo you just mix the cream you had planned with all of the ingredients and hope it's what you wanted? \n\nThis is what I mostly did in the past, because everything was new and I had to try it all asap... but I now realize this way you won't easily be able to detect problematic ingredients.\n\nOr do you formulate in phases and just take your sweet time? \n\nAs in, first the bare basics ( just your base oils, water, (co-)emulsifier and preservative), see how you like it for a few weeks and adjust until it's perfect. Then build onto that base recipe by adding 1-2 new (active) ingredients, testing it for a few weeks. Rinse and repeat.  \nThis way feels like it'd take years to get to a good formula...unless you're able to make tiny 5-10g batches.  \n\n\nFor anyone who's interested, here's a draft of what I have in mind for the final version. There will still be lots of re-shuffeling/eliminating of ingredients and percentages though :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|*Water*|%100-(rest of ingredients)|distilled water|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n|Oils|5%|raspberry seed oil|\n||5%|pomegranate seed oil|\n||2%|squalan|\n||8%|caprylic triglyceride|\n||||\n|(co-)Emulsifiers|3.5%|Montanov 68|\n||1.5%|Cetyl Alcohol|\n||||\n|Stabilizer|?%|xanthan gum|\n||||\n|Actives|2.5%|gamma oryzanol|\n||2%|Sodium PCA|\n||2%|Niacinamide|\n||2%|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n||1.5%|Pentavitin|\n||1%|D-panthenol|\n||1%|Vitamin E|\n||0.5%|Ectoin|\n||0.5%|Koffein|\n||0.1%|Hyaluronic acid low|\n||0.1%|Hyaluronic acid high|\n||0.1%|Allantoin|\n||||\n|Preservatives|parabeen K\\* or Germaben ii|\"5 drops for 50g\" or 0.5-1%|\n|potential pH Modifier|?|?|\n\n\\*For some reason Parabeen K doesn't do percentages, only drops... but it's one of the few blends I can get over here that contains parabens.\n\n***Discaimer***\\*: I'm really rusty regarding oil/water/heated/cool down phases, so I still need to figure out which ingredients go where, hence just a general list of ingredients for now.",

Sometimes, the body organs are failed to digest the food due to the imbalance of hormones or dysfunctional metabolism.\n\nOften, it seems that the lack of essential nutrients might not boost your metabolism to actively perform regular tasks. So, the enzyme activity is also disturbed, the chances of collection of fat increases. Besides, some external factors that such as lack of physical activity, play, or even walk may also affect the metabolism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Order Today From The Official Website And Get 50% Off Use This Link](https://52a81mxdn32x2zbhljk72lim2d.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=METICOREA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlvkpm7t10i51.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686bb29b5e9293647547e1576464d2d9dedb144c\n\n# Meticore Review\n\nThe **Meticore supplement** is a supernatural formula that has been designed in consideration of extracts of potent plants and herbs that are valuable for weight loss and have no side effects if consumed.\n\nEach of the ingredients is meticulously studied and after careful research over the benefits, these are encapsulated in a single supplement.

Many studies depicted well-known results when added African mango in their diet twice a day.\n\nIn one study, those subjects who frequently took African mango in their everyday routine tend to lower body fat by nearly 20% from the overall body and six inches around the waist.\n\n**Moringa oleifera**: Moringa leaves are said to be very efficacious in terms of weight loss.

It should have a similarly gentle cleansing ability and it's a solid at room temp which can make weighing easier. \n\nBut I don't know if any body washes that use such a high oil percentage. You're reducing the cleaning ability if an already mild cleanser with all that oil. It might turn it into more of a lotion than a cleanser with that formula. \n\nI usually use 5-10% surfactant for washes plus thickening agents to stabilize and give the consistency everyone looks for. Adding oil will reduce foaming and effectiveness of the cleanser which might just leave the skin oily afterward and not feeling clean.\n\nEdit: you might try adding some glycerine (5-10%) to reduce the harshness you feel on your hands. Adding a large amount (up to 40%) can cause the surfactant to crash out in some cases, but it can reduce the stability of the foam which may not be wanted. Play around and see what works best for you.",

        "body": "This type of product isn't really a body wash, it's what is usually called a foaming shower oil. If you want to make a more traditional body wash, I could dig up some formulas for you. If you want to make a foaming shower oil, I have a few tips on getting Lumorol K 5229, and an alternative.\n\nI bought Lumorol K5229 from [Aromantic](https://aromantic.co.uk/products/lumorol-k-5229) in the UK. It by far had the cheapest shipping to Australia of any of the shops I found that stock it. (It cost me £12.40 shipping for 6 small items - about 450g of products - when I ordered about a year ago). \n\nAs u/elegantbeigemetallic mentioned, My Skin Recipes in Thailand also stocks it as [Oil Soap](https://www.myskinrecipes.com/shop/en/blended-surfactant-base/677-mipa-laureth-sulfate-oil-soap.html). MSR's international shipping is quite expensive, but they have a lot of hard-to-find ingredients at very cheap prices, so it's possible to do an order that makes it worthwhile.\n\nYou can't substitute just any surfactant to create a foaming oil. All the foaming shower oil formulas and products I've seen use either MIPA laureth sulfate or TIPA laureth sulfate. (I'm interested in understanding more about what makes these surfactants able to foam with high oil content, if anyone here knows and could weigh in). You can make oil-to-milk cleansers with a variety of surfactants, but they don't foam and the skinfeel is different.\n\nThe only available substitute I've found is one that Aroma Zone in France stocks, which they call [Tensioactif Pour Huiles Rinçables Sans Palme](https://www.aroma-zone.com/info/fiche-technique/tensioactif-pour-huiles-rincables-aroma-zone). It has an INCI of: Potassium cocoyl rice amino acids, Aqua, Coco-caprylate. AZ has reasonable international shipping (free over about €90). I have this ingredient and it's OK, but I prefer the Lumorol. \n\nI really like the foaming shower oils and balms I've made with Lumorol K 5229, and even found them gentle enough for my very sensitive face. But note that some people may find this type of product irritating - I read a study showing that some shower oils of this type could cause irritation because the oil could prevent the surfactant rinsing off thoroughly.",

    "body": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a significant global health challenge with limited FDA-approved treatments, necessitating the search for novel preventive strategies. Antioxidants that are present in fruits and vegetables have garnered attention due to their potential neuroprotective effects. Among these, pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) has emerged as a promising source of neuroprotective antioxidants as it is rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and hydrolysable tannins. Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) is a source of bioactive compounds that may modulate key pathological processes of AD. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of PSO in murine neuroblastoma N2a cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate AD-like inflammation. The effects of PSO on inflammation and oxidative stress markers, including TNF-α, iNOS, SOD1, and IL1β, were evaluated, along with changes in AD-related biomarkers Aβ42, Aβ40, and p-tau181. Additionally, the study extended its findings to clinical settings by assessing the impact of supervised PSO consumption for 12 months on similar biomarkers in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Results from this integrative approach demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of PSO, supporting its role in modulating AD-associated pathophysiology. These findings suggest that PSO may serve as an early-stage intervention to delay or mitigate AD progression, highlighting its therapeutic potential in preclinical and clinical contexts.\n\n\n\nTo stay on top of the latest research on improving every aspect of your biology - join the discord [https://discord.gg/q7qVZVCamp](https://discord.gg/q7qVZVCamp)",

    "body": "Hi  everyone! I'm a long-time lurker, first time poster. I've been dealing  with acne for years, and then recently my skin had been cooperating and  my acne had virtually disappeared aside from one or two hormonal  breakouts every so often. I decided it was one of those things where  time, luck, and a good routine worked spontaneously together. Tbh I  didn't care why my skin was behaving, it was just a huge relief. I'm  sure many of you can relate.\n\nBut recently  I went back to some old products with blind confidence my skin had  permanently improved, and broke out. This is tragic because every single  breakout on my skin scars no matter what I do. But now I'm trying to  educate myself and figure out what ingredients have caused me to break  out. The three products I suspect caused my breakout:\n\n\\-Switched from Cerave Baby lotion (love it, now I'm back to it and scared to change again) to the **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Face Moisturizer**,  Ingredients: Water, Glyceryl Stearate Se, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric  Triglyceride,  Cetyl Alcohol, Collodial Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Squalane,  Urea,  Allantoin, Ceramide Np, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter,  Limnanthes  Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil,   Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf   Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Caprylyl Glycol,   Phenoxyethanol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Leuconostoc/Radish Root   Ferment Filtrate, Edta.\n\n\\-Tried out my **IT Cosmetics CC cream**  that I used a long time ago when my acne was already bad, but now I  realize makes me breakout, Ingredients: ACTIVE INGREDIENTS: TITANIUM  DIOXIDE 9.0% ZINC OXIDE 6.3% INACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, SNAIL  SECRETION FILTRATE, PHENYL  TRIMETHICONE, DIMETHICONE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL,  BUTYLENE GLYCOL  DICAPRYLATE/DICAPRATE, ORBIGNYA OLEIFERA SEED OIL,  BUTYLOCTYL  SALICYLATE, CETYL PEG/PPG-10/1 DIMETHICONE,  CYCLOPENTASILOXANE,  CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE,  POLYGLYCERYL-4 ISOSTEARATE,  DIMETHICONE/VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER,  ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE, HEXYL  LAURATE, STEARIC ACID, CALCIUM STEARATE,  CAPRYLYL GLYCOL,  TRIETHOXYCAPRYLYLSILANE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CITRUS  MEDICA LIMONUM  (LEMON) PEEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, SORBITAN  ISOSTEARATE,  PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRUS AURANTIUM BERGAMIA (BERGAMOT) FRUIT  OIL,  1,2-HEXANEDIOL, DISODIUM EDTA, CITRUS AURANTIUM DULCIS (ORANGE)  PEEL  OIL, CITRUS AURANTIFOLIA (LIME) OIL, VITIS VINIFERA (GRAPE) SEED  OIL,  PUNICA GRANATUM SEED OIL, PINUS SYLVESTRIS LEAF OIL, PERSEA  GRATISSIMA  (AVOCADO) OIL, NIACINAMIDE, CITRUS GRANDIS (GRAPEFRUIT) PEEL  OIL,  CHOLESTEROL, ANTHEMIS NOBILIS FLOWER WATER,  LACTOBACILLUS/HONEYSUCKLE  FLOWER/LICORICE ROOT/MORUS ALBA ROOT/PUERARIA  LOBATA ROOT/SCHIZANDRA  CHINENSIS FRUIT/SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS  ROOT/SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER  EXTRACT FERMENT FILTRATE, PERFLUOROHEXANE,  OLEA EUROPAEA (OLIVE) LEAF  EXTRACT, GLYCERIN, EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS LEAF  OIL, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF  EXTRACT, CHRYSANTHEMUM INDICUM FLOWER  EXTRACT, PUERARIA LOBATA ROOT  EXTRACT, PERFLUORODECALIN, MORUS ALBA  FRUIT EXTRACT, MAGNOLIA KOBUS BARK  EXTRACT, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN)  SPROUT EXTRACT, DIOSPYROS KAKI LEAF  EXTRACT, CINNAMOMUM CASSIA BARK  EXTRACT, ARTEMISIA PRINCEPS LEAF  EXTRACT, PENTAFLUOROPROPANE, CURCUMA  LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT,  STEARETH-20, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID,  COLLOIDAL OATMEAL, HYDROLYZED  SILK, CITRIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE,  POTASSIUM SORBATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS  LEAF EXTRACT, N-HYDROXYSUCCINIMIDE,  HYDROLYZED COLLAGEN,  CAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID, TOCOPHEROL, THIAMINE HCL,  RIBOFLAVIN, RETINYL  PALMITATE, PANTOTHENIC ACID, PALMITOYL  OLIGOPEPTIDE, NIACIN, FOLIC ACID,  CHRYSIN, CARNITINE HCL, BIOTIN,  ASCORBIC ACID, PALMITOYL  TETRAPEPTIDE-7, CHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE. MAY  CONTAIN: IRON OXIDES (CI  77492, CI 77491, CI 77499).\n\n\\-**Aztec Healing Indian Clay w/ apple cider vinegar** to activate it.  Just throwing this in, kind of unrelated. I had this laying around, and after I broke out I  decided to whip it back out for a face detox. I suspect it made things  worse. I've always thought this broke me out, but there's only rave  reviews for it online so I always brushed it off as purging. But can  anyone else relate to ACV or the clay causing breakouts?\n\nAnyway,  I don't see too many similarities in these products. I don't think  I'm sensitive to alcohols, since I use Cerave just fine. Everything I  get is also fragrance free. I can't figure out what these have in common, or what common irritants for acne I'm missing. Any insights?\n\n&#x200B;",

Before switching I used my mom’s nutriplenish light product a few times and LOVED how soft my hair felt. \n\nMy salon was out of nutriplenish light, so my stylist gave me the deep version and told me to use less. \n\nIve been using the nutriplenish for about a month, once or twice a week. I’ve noticed that when I use it, I’m oily at my roots immediately, which is completely out of the ordinary for me. My hair is otherwise pretty healthy, but it feels weird at the ends now that I use the nutriplenish. I can’t really describe how it feels weird, but it’s almost like it feels over saturated with product or something. I used a clarifying shampoo very frequently before I switched to nutriplenish, so maybe my hair just needs time to adjust? I was worried at first that I might not be washing out the product thoroughly enough, but I’ve spent extra time on washing it out and the problem still persists. The only other product I’m using is Olaplex 3, which I have used for at least a year with no issues. \n\nFor reference, my hair is between 2C wavy, super thick, and about four inches past shoulder length. \n\nI appreciate any insight anyone here may have!",

It’s not a bad thing at all, silicones are exactly what you need for a heat protectant. But considering that protein overload is also build up I’d make sure your shampoo has decently strong surfactants (or use a clarifying shampoo periodically).\n\nI’m gonna ask a bit of an unsolicited question, apologies if you’re not open to it, definitely just ignore it if that’s the case. Are you sure your hair is low porosity? Usually bleached hair is always high porosity (or at least medium) because of the chemical process involved.",

But none really compare with the onion, which we see so often in our kitchens. \n\nThe onion is neither a root nor a stem. It is actually an underground stem, also called the bulb. \n\nSince ancient times, it has been a religious practice amongst the Hindus in India to rub raw onions on the scalp after “mundan”, a religious ceremony where the hair of the male child is shaved off. Daily rubbing of onions on the shaved head would render a thicker outgrowth of strong healthy hair. \n\nYou can either rub raw onions directly on your scalp, or you can go for an organic onion oil extract.\n\nI used Indus Valley Onion Hair Fall Control Oil and I have not regretted it till date. \n\nWhat really attracted me to this oil was its highly enriched formulation. The oil had the purest extracts of organically grown onions mixed with 8 other super-exotic organic hair care herb extracts. This was something I would have never found in any kitchen. So, I went for it. \n\nThe 8 other super-exotic herb extracts mixed with organic onion oil are—almond oil, black seed oil, grape seed oil, castor oil, wheat germ oil, pomegranate seed oil, sea buckthorn seed oil and lotus seed oil. Can you ever find anything more powerful and robust than this? I guess, no.\n\nSo, I recommend that you buy this oil. Experience this beauty, to believe it… cherish it.",

I have taken safflower oil alone so I know it isn't the safflower helping me and is responsible for undesired effects.

    "body": "tl;dr Normal-to-dry skin with closed comedones and hormonal acne on chin and around jawline; looking for a first product to introduce to try to deal with the congestion on my chin.\n\nHi all!  I have been lurking for a while but have just decided to take the plunge and seek some advice.  I am hoping to start to build a skincare routine from my current foundations, to tackle my existing issues without exacerbating my sensitive skin.  For what it's worth, I am also dealing with some anxiety (and I'm trying to get myself to a therapist to start to work on this), so I am feeling sort of overwhelmed by the prospect of wading through a sea of information about skincare to identify the best first steps for me, prioritizing products, and introducing new products that might cause acne.  I have been perseverating about my skin issues for ages, reading a ton of threads and posts about skincare, and filling online shopping carts with products without pulling the trigger.  So I'm hoping that actually posting and seeking help will motivate me to keep going.\n\n**The issue(s)**:  My main issue is acne around my mouth, on my chin, and on my jawline, and what I believe are CCs under the corners of my mouth and on my jawline.  I occasionally get acne around my hairline as well.  I have the CCs most of the time, I often have one or two whiteheads, and periodically I will get one or two deeper, under-the-surface throbbing red spots.  I think that my acne and skin congestion are at least somewhat related to hormones, since they tend to get worse cyclically, but I have gotten my hormones tested and nothing appears to be obviously out of whack.  I think lack of sleep and stress at work can be big factors.  I also have some pretty minor pigmentation from past acne.  When I look up PIH, PIE, and acne scarring, my pigmentation doesn't appear to map fully onto any of the images I see; it's very light pink, not brown or red, and there's no pitting.  I just turned 30, so I'm also starting to get a few lines on my forehead and around my eyes, but that is a much lower priority for me than addressing the acne.  I would really like to focus on clearing up the under-the-surface congestion/CCs, and I would love to get to the point where I don't feel the need to wear concealer every day to cover up both my active acne and the pigmentation.\n\n**Skin type**:  I think my skin is normal but acne prone, tending toward dry if I had to choose.  Very occasionally I get small flaky patches (especially on the rare occasions when I have introduced a product that seems too drying or I’ve overdone it by being overly zealous about trying to clear up a big pimple).\n\n**Current routine**:  I have a minimal routine.  In the evening I remove makeup with a cleansing oil (the Primally Pure normal cleansing oil, which contains sunflower oil, castor oil, jojoba oil, avocado oil, pomegranate seed oil, and essential oils of orange, lavender, geranium, and peppermint), I very occasionally follow up with the charcoal bar by BeautyCounter (I know it's an MLM but a few of the products seem to work pretty well for me!), and I \"moisturize\" with Dessert Essences organic jojoba oil.  In the morning I occasionally put on a bit of jojoba oil and 100% Pure caffeine eye cream (though I am wondering if repeated use of the eye cream is making me break out on the bridge of my nose).  I have stuck with this routine for a while, and it doesn't seem to exacerbate any of my issues, though it doesn't address any of them either.\n\n\n\nI realize that my issues are not new and I have certainly spent a lot of time searching through the subreddit and reading a range of approaches to similar concerns, but I think the sheer wealth of information is overwhelming me a bit.  I would love some advice on first steps to take to start clearing up the congestion/CCs in particular.  If you had never addressed your closed comedones and were about to introduce a first product, where would you start?\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

I [buy essential oils online] (https://www.mallofcosmetics.com/) and I found this brand at Mall of Cosmetics which sells specialized beauty oils. I think they are called ‘Shiny Leaf’. I checked the website and it actually looks promising and I also noticed that this is a new brand. So they currently have three essential oils in there and I’m looking for something that’s really light on the face and does not really oil up. \n\nSo what do you guys suggest I get, the castor oil, rose oil, or the pomegranate seed oil?

    "body": "By Gary Anderson\n   \n   \nPomegranate oils are very rich and nutritious, which are used externally or internally for medicinal or cosmetic purposes. The reformative properties of the emollient mark it as an indispensable component of numerous skin care products. The oils are included in many cosmetic formulas like gels, moisturizer, shower, massage oils, soap and other membrane care products. It is also used as a diffuser and nebulizer. It is composed of, Mycenae, Limonene, Alpha Terpinenol Pinene and Sabinene which are essential elements in cell activities. Only meager quantity is required in achieving positive outcomes. Top benefits of the [natural pomegranate seed oil facial serum](www.edensent.com/) are discussed below.\n   \n   \n The balms made naturally from the seeds of this plant are harmless, and everyone can use them. People suffer from different creams because they may not have discovered the oils that will fit their skin type. Nonetheless, when individuals use the pomegranate emollient they will not stress of selection, because it works with all including acne and oily skins.\n   \n   \n The anti-inflammatory nature is yet another benefit found in the oils from natural seeds. Many people suffer from sunburns and reddening when they are exposed to scorching rays. The use of this ointment from the seeds helps the affected people with the skin inflammation to heal the wounds and recover the beautiful look on their face. The natural ointments direct nutrients directly to a cell which helps cellular degenerations, improving the health of the skin.\n   \n   \n Skin texture is determined by hormones and how they react with substances applied on the membrane. When the artificial oils contain chemicals, the hormones will try to detoxify while fighting against them. Resultantly, the membrane becomes rough. Nevertheless, the opposite is achieved from the compatible oils made from seeds of pomegranates.\n   \n   \n Massage is one of the activities that many people are involved with at their free time. The relaxation is achieved by the rubbing and other actions of body. Face massages are also provided, and the expert is required to use a cream to rub gently and smoothly. The pomegranate is liked since a small amount is enough and makes it economical.\n   \n   \n No one would want to appear old from the look of the faces. With this, many people have adopted the use of anti-aging creams. The lotions make the skin to look as young as that of a teenager. Pomegranate is an ingredient added to the creams because of regenerative properties it has. Hence, the cells are rejuvenated and multiplication also takes places with the cellular production.\n   \n   \n Cancer is one of the disastrous diseases in the world. Patients suffer from the incurable illness that is associated with many health effects. Skin cancer is mainly triggered by free radicals. Finding a way of preventing the rays from reaching the face may be challenging since covering is simply impossible. However, application of natural oil may assist with its protective properties.\n   \n   \n You should not let others benefit from the use of the oils while you are afraid of change. Consider the importance above and you will see the need of taking the risk on using the emollient. Apart from facial skin advantages above, you will realize that you can have other benefits to your health when you use the pomegranate oils.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n About the Author:\n   \n\n   \nWhen you are looking for the facts about [natural pomegranate seed oil facial serum](http://www.edensent.com), come to our web pages today.

I'm seeing a dermatologist soon to get to the bottom of what's causing this, but wanted to ask for recommendations on how to treat what's already there.\n\nThe pimples I have on my cheeks are dark red and kind of shiny. Some of them I've extracted (very carefully lanced and put hydrocoloid bandage on overnight), and whereas if I did that to a pimple on my forehead (my normal breakout area), it would fade in a day or two, these are sticking around for several days-weeks. They are smaller than cysts by the way, and not nearly as inflamed as cysts I've had in the past. It's like the inflammation is contained to a small bump.\n\nUsually, I'd put aquaphor on a healing pimple overnight after getting the infection out, but there are no scabs on these ones, and it hasn't helped. **They kind of ache, and I don't know how to best care for them. If any of you have tips on how to treat these, I would really appreciate your input!**\n\nFor reference:\n\nAM: cerave foaming cleanser, avene extreme tolerance light cream + eltamd spf 40\n\nPM: pomegranate seed oil + cerave foaming cleanser, up until this week was using drunk elephant framboos serum, but just switched back to PC BHA 2&#37;, and avene tolerance again.",

Start taking care of yourself in a 100% natural way with pomegranate oil by reading our article.\n\n📷\n\n**What is Pomegranate Oil?**\n\nThe pomegranate oil is a natural product extracted from dry seeds of pomegranate fruit. This process can be done by cold pressing or by extraction with the use of CO2.\n\nIt is an oil characterized by being poly-unsaturated, and to avoid rapid oxidation it is necessary to keep it away from heat, oxygen and light. It is a thick oil, with a slightly acidic and fruity odor.\n\n**Vitamins in Pomegranate Oil for Skin**\n\nPomegranate is a fruit native to Asia, very rich in vitamins A, C and E, in potassium and other minerals such as calcium, phosphorus or potassium, important for the proper functioning of our body. \n\nThis fruit has been used since antiquity for medicinal purposes, especially in the regions of the Middle East and the Far East.\n\nIn its composition, it contains large amounts of a very rare fatty acid, it is punic acid or Omega 5 as we commonly know them. This compound is up to 6 times more antioxidant than grape seed extract.\n\nIt promotes the production of collagen, improves elasticity and tone, and protects from harmful sun rays and pollution.\n\n**Benefits of Pomegranate Oil for Skin**\n\nPomegranate oil activates and protects the physiological functions of the skin, promotes the production of collagen, essential for healthy skin, rejuvenates and hydrates skin cells, improves its elasticity and volume, protects the skin from the damaging effects of the sun and pollution and much more!\n\n**1.** **Pomegranate Oil for Anti-Aging**\n\nPomegranate juice is a great remedy for skin affected by sun exposure or aging. Through its application we will repair the damage and we will have a softer and younger skin.\n\nPomegranate oil is currently considered the most effective product to treat and regenerate mature skin and to prevent the appearance of wrinkles.\n\nThe components of the pomegranate lengthen the life of the fibroblasts, the cells responsible for the production of collagen and elastin (responsible for the elasticity and vitality of the skin), thus promoting facial rejuvenation.\n\n**2.** **Pomegranate Oil for Acne Skin**\n\nFor those who already have an acne outbreak, it is recommended to apply pomegranate oil to the affected area. And this will cure acne and promote the disappearance of scars.\n\nAs a consequence of hormonal imbalances or digestive problems, acne affects a large part of the population. Generally, teenagers. Well, the pomegranate fights the appearance of acne, killing the root cause. That is, it corrects digestive problems and favors a correct blood circulation.\n\n**3.** **Pomegranate Oil for Your Skin Moisturizing**\n\nFor all the qualities mentioned above, pomegranate gives great elasticity to the skin. So, it is one of the best allies to maintain well-hydrated skin.\n\n**4.** **Pomegranate Oil as An Anticancer Agent**\n\nPomegranate is high in antioxidants that help stimulate white blood cells to neutralize toxins in the body, promoting a healthy and strong immune system. \n\nIn addition, it removes free radicals from the body and stops the development of cancer or any other disease.\n\nThese compounds, with a high antioxidant power, offer the body protection against certain types of cancer and cardiovascular and degenerative diseases.\n\n**5.** **Pomegranate Oil for Skin Infections**\n\nThe anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties help treat skin infections. From minor wounds to psoriasis they can be treated with pomegranate oil and with good results.\n\n**6.** **Pomegranate Oil for Tightening and Firming Your Skin** \n\nPomegranate essential oil helps to firm and tighten the skin. Although it is not widely used or at least not as popular as lavender, it is very effective in caring for the skin.\n\nSimilarly, it promotes blood circulation and protects the skin from sun damage. It is prepared in the same way as the previous oils and it is applied in the nights before sleeping.\n\nAmong the many benefits that this oil brings to our skin, we can highlight the following:\n\n· It delays cellular aging, attenuates and prevents the appearance of expression wrinkles.\n\n· It is a powerful antioxidant that effectively fights free radicals.\n\n· Moisturizes the skin and prevents epidermal dehydration, making it a perfect ally for dry and mature skin that over time loses its natural capabilities and dehydrates quickly.\n\n· With a calming and anti-inflammatory effect. Recommended for sensitive, irritated, reactive and damaged skin.\n\n· Maintains elasticity, the epidermis becomes more elastic, soft, resistant and smooth.\n\n· It stimulates the production of keratin and the regeneration of the skin.\n\n· Attenuates and prevents skin spots caused by aging.\n\n**How to Use Pomegranate Oil on Your Skin?**\n\nAs it is a very powerful and dense oil, it is recommended to use it in small amounts to use it, it can also be used in synergy with other vegetable oils or as an active ingredient in specially formulated emulsions.\n\n**BONUS TIP: The correct way to use essential oils is to mix 4 drops of carrier oil with 1 drop of essential oil. No matter how much you do, you must maintain this measure. For every drop of essential oil, add 4 of the carrier oil.**\n\nHere are some examples of natural cosmetic products in which pomegranate seed oil could enhance the formula:\n\n\\- Regenerating facial oil\n\n\\- Serum for mature skin\n\n\\- Antioxidant and protective cream\n\n**Summarization**\n\nIn short, pomegranate oil is suitable for any skin type. If it is dry skin, it hydrates it and protects it from the appearance of possible cracks and irritations. If, on the contrary, it is oily skin, it will prevent the appearance of blackheads and acne.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, you can leave them in the comments and we'll be happy to answer them!",

    "body": "It’s nice to have a nightly ritual before bed that helps us take care of ourselves physically and mentally. Establishing a night time skin care routine for ourselves allows us to unwind from the stresses of the day and ease into bedtime sleep. Night time, when our body is at rest, is when most of our restorative processes are at work to heal our bodies, and that includes our skin! That’s why it’s important to have a night time skin care routine that emphasizes healing and nourishing your skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile this is meant to be an informative and general guide, keep in mind that your skin might prefer a different order of products than what is listed! Or sometimes, our skin just hates a particular step. These are not strict rules and we encourage you to experiment if something is not working. Pay attention to how your skin reacts to certain products. Always patch test your products for allergies before applying all over when trying new products and remember to be patient with your skin.\n\nStep 1: Cleansing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to cleansing your skin at the end of the day, it is important that we are thorough, but not too harsh on our skin. If you are a makeup-wearer, cleansing comes in two parts: oil cleansing and foam cleansing. Be gentle to your skin! Oil cleansing is the best way to easily remove your makeup without the tugging and pulling of makeup wipes. When this friction is regularly applied to your skin, it might contribute to the formation of wrinkles and we want to avoid this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people do not like using an oil cleanser on their skin, and that’s perfectly fine! Another alternative is using micellar water to cleanse. Micellar water consists of soft water with suspended micelles molecules that gently cleanses the skin of makeup, dirt, oils, and more. It has a lighter and gentler cleansing than oil cleansers, but many people prefer it over oil cleansers. It is a great choice if you wear very little makeup, don’t wear makeup, or just need a quick refresher for your skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you have cleansed your skin of makeup (or any other heavy-duty product you might have on your skin that won’t come off so easily, like sunscreen), the next part of cleansing is a gentle foaming cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis second cleansing steps ensures that all dirt and makeup is removed from the skin. Here, we use a gentle foaming cleanser in order to clean off the oil and any residual makeup on your skin. We all know that having makeup on your skin overnight can cause breakouts and other problems. Let’s make sure that our skin is clean before moving on to the next steps of your night time skin care routine!\n\nStep 2: (Optional) Actives and Physical Exfoliation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExfoliating is an optional step,and should only be done at most two to three times a week. There are two types of exfoliating methods: physical and chemical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPhysical exfoliation is often in the form of scrubs, such as sugar scrubs or konjac sponges, that physically remove dead skin on the uppermost layer of your skin. Chemical exfoliation is done with gentle, low concentration of actives, such as AHA, BHA, PHA, Glycolic Acid, and more. With chemical exfoliation, dead skin is slowly removed with acids. Since it is not as abrasive on the skin as physical exfoliation, it is often revered by skin care fanatics. Each physical and chemical exfoliation methods have their advantages and disadvantages to them. Do thorough research, start out slow, and pay attention to any signs of irritation.\n\nStep 3: Toners\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter cleansing and exfoliating, our skin may begin to feel dry, so it is important to hydrate our skin with a hydrating toner. Rose water toner sprays, alcohol-free witch hazel toners, or hyaluronic acid toners are common hydrating toners used. Make sure that your toner actually has humectant ingredients, since those are the hydrating ingredients that will hydrate your skin. Apply the toner to your hand or to a cotton round and gently rub the toner onto your skin. Generally, we would recommend using your hand because cotton rounds tend to hold a lot of product. Pat the product into your skin until fully absorbed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSheet masks are also a great way to plump and hydrate your skin! Sheet masks contain concentrated hydrating ingredients that sit on your face for about ten to fifteen minutes. It is a great booster for when your skin is feeling extra dry or whenever you want to treat yourself. After ten to fifteen minutes, you would remove the sheet mask and pat the excess into your skin.\n\nStep 4: Facial Oils\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, it’s time to seal in the hydration from your toner with a natural and nourishing carrier oil. If you have acne-prone skin or dark spots, we recommend Rosehip Oil, Grapeseed Oil, or Pomegranate Seed Oil, since they are rich in natural antioxidants that helps even your skin tone. If you have normal-type skin, we recommend Jojoba Oil or Sweet Almond Oil. For those with dry skin, Tamanu Oil, Hemp Seed Oil, and Avocado Oil are very nourishing and are a little heavier than the other oils. If you are not comfortable with oils, you can skip this step. But many people prefer using natural ingredients in their skin care, and others swear by it.\n\nStep 5: Eye Cream, Night Cream\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo night time skin care routine is complete without eye cream and night cream. For eye cream, using it can help with dry skin or fine lines. Many people skip the eye cream as they feel it is not necessary for them, and if you feel as if you are in the same boat, then skip! But for those with dehydrated skin under their eyes, it may help to use eye cream. With a small amount of product on your finger, gently tap (like you’re playing the piano) the cream onto the under area of your eyes until it is fully absorbed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor our night cream, a heavy moisturizer is great to seal in all your skin care into your skin and keep your skin hydrated and moisturized all night! Some people will use a heavy cream, while others may use Vaseline to seal in hydration. For added benefits, using a night cream with humectant ingredients, like glycerine, can provide a boost in hydration while you sleep so that you can wake up with plump and hydrated skin!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important thing when it comes to a night time skin care routine is actually creating a routine and doing it every day, but also paying attention to what your skin needs. As long as you are following these general rules, you will be on a path to healthy and glowing in no time!",
