    "body": "After seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/r613jf/my_experience_with_prose_finethin_curlywavy_hair/) on here, I was inspired to share my thoughts about my experience with Prose.\n\n**My hair:** 2A, fine-medium strands and medium density. It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The ‚Äúfactors‚Äù they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind. (who knows how much of this they actually factor in but whatever lol.)\n\n**Full Ingredients lists:**\n\n*Shampoo:*  Water, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl- Glucoside, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Jasmin Flower Water, Propanediol Dicaprylate, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, PPG-Caprylyl Ether, Pyridoxine, Panthenol, Jujube Bark Extract, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyquaternium-10, Tropolone, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Kale Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Spirulina Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Yucca Stem Extract, Arginine, Cannabidiol, Cocamidopropyl PG- dimonium Chloride, Grape Seed Extract\n\n*Conditioner:* Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance, Cetrimonium Chloride, Birch Juice, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-7 Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-7, Polyquaternium-10, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 20, Poppy Seed Oil, Plum Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cocamidopropyl PG-dimonium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**(These lists look pretty basic to me. But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them üôÑ. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called ‚ÄúOdele Volumizing Shampoo‚Äù which I used before Prose. And yall‚Ä¶ The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that‚Äôs what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

    "body": "**Personal Info:**\n\nI live in nothern europe, so currently cold, windy and dry Climate. My Skintype is sahara desert dry, prone to closed comedones plus some light hormonal acne. Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

However, with the lockdown all theTBS stores I know of were closed and I could not get my hands on this particular one even from their website, so I decided to try out something else. I chose the Vilvah Goat Milk Shampoo instead. And below is my experience of using the product.\n\nHair type and basic hair care routine- Female-28. I have type 1C hair, with moderately oily scalp and normal strands. Since I live in a highly polluted city, my scalp and the hair shafts become greasy if I go too long without a shampoo. I do not oil my hair except for the three winter-months, and that too not very regularly. I don't have a dandruff issue, and have shoulder length, non-chemically treated hair which I let air-dry. The only hair related problem I face is the occasional increase in hairfall ( I don't sleep well and take a lot of stress) and the coarseness of the hair making it look frizzy. You can literally thread a needle with a  strand of my hair.\n\nIngredients: Aqua, jasmine flower water, goatmilk, disodium cocoyl glutamate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium Lauryl sarcosinate, xanthan gum, hydrolyzed pea protein, potassium sorbate and sodium benzonate, Lemon peel oil, Jasmine oil, Peru Balsam oil, Ethylene Glycol Mono Stearate, sodium gluconate.\nThe shampoo claims to be pH balanced, I haven't tested it, it also claims to contain Ecocert approved safe preservatives.\n\nProduct details- I got the 500ml bottle which comes with a pump dispenser and is made of steel. It retails for Rs. 1380, but I paid around 1200 including shipping because I got it on a discount and directly from their website. \nThe texture is slightly wobbly and pearly white in colour with a strong jasmine fragrance.\n\nMy experience with the product- I used it along with TBS Rainforest conditioner/ Plum olive and macadamia conditioner. It adequately cleansed my scalp and worked really well with both the conditioners. It lathers pretty well even with hard water. My needle-point ends were softer, and frizz was tamed for at least a couple of days. My hair was glossy, glossier than when I used TBS shampoo, and it did not cause additional hair fall.\nThe strong jasmine smell was a bother because I simply don't like floral aroma in my products, but it does not last long in my hair. \n\nMy verdict on the product-  I feel it's a bit overpriced even for the quantity and the eco-friendly packaging, and I couldn't really find any reliable source/study to justify it's liberal use of jasmine water and oil. It did work for my hair and I will repurchase if I do not find a more inexpensive alternative in the mild everyday- use kind of shampoo category.\n\nPS- this is the first review I've posted in the sub, I don't know if I've missed anything. I really wanted to include a photo but could not figure out how to do it from my phone, my laptop has conked out.",

Blend it all over your face on bare skin or over foundation for healthy, glowing skin. Wear it as a highlighter on your cheekbones, collarbones, eyes, and other high points of your face for subtle radiance. Or combine it with liquid foundation or moisturizer for a soft-focus, lit-from-within effect. Check out our Bionic Glow how-to video to see all the ways to wear it in action.\n\n*How shimmery is Bionic Glow?*\n\n- We formulated Bionic Glow to give your skin a super natural-looking, lit-from-within effect. Think that healthy, radiant glow you get after a facial. Subtle‚Äînot sparkly. \n\n*What‚Äôs the difference between Bionic Glow and the cream Highlighter stick?*\n\n- We recommend Bionic Glow for anyone who prefers a liquid formula, a more sheer, hydrated finish, and makeup with skincare benefits. It's also ideal if you want a formula that layers easily over foundation and other makeup. Highlighter is great if you prefer a buildable cream formula and a stick format for precise application.\n\n\n‚ùÑÔ∏è __Ingredients__\n\n- *Snow mushroom, reishi mushroom, and hyaluronic acid* hydrate to give you smoother-looking, plumper-looking skin.\n\n- *Vegan plant-derived collagen* helps improve the look of skin texture, elasticity, and firmness.\n\n- *Pea protein* helps provide blue light protection from electronic devices.\n\nPrunus Cerasus (Bitter Cherry) Fruit Water, C10-18 Triglycerides, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Mica, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Aqua/Water/Eau, Acacia Senegal Gum, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Ganoderma Lucidum (Mushroom) Stem Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Sr-Hydrozoan Polypeptide-1, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glucose, Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Gluconate, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Succinate, Tin Oxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance (Parfum), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77499).",

After reading the ingredients, I cannot find anything that clears buildup (for me this would mean buildup caused by polyquats and guar) except maybe the mIcELLaR wAtEr which I doubt works the same way on hair as it does on skin. What's more, it has two ingredients, albeit low on the INCI, that can cause buildup: guar and polyquaternium-11. At most, it has surfactants that DevaCurl's cleansers also have.\n\nHere is the INCI:\n\nWater (Aqua, Eau), Lactamide MEA, Glycerin, Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil, Limonium Gerberi Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Panthenol, Melissa Officinalis Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxyproplytrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cetrimonium Chloride, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyacrylate-1 Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Polyquaternium-11, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum).\n\nCan someone who is better versed in chemistry than me assuage or confirm my doubts?",

I was given a list of some products that were safe to use and finally had my skin almost perfect for the first time in years!  But then a few things happened...\n\n1. My fiance developed a sudden and severe skin allergy to my \"safe\" laundry detergent and we had to switch it immediately.  The laundry detergent he was told to switch to (Tide Gentle & Free Liquid) seemed okay based on ingredients, but was missing from my \"safe list\" and I very obviously reacted to it within a few days.  We agreed to switch to Tide Gentle & Free Powder Detergent (which WAS on the safe list) ASAP but with COVID it took 2 weeks to arrive.  In that time I developed a decently bad rash on my chest and some flair ups in previous problem areas (behind my ears and back of the neck).  They burned to the touch, like my dermatitis rashes tend to.\n2. Switched the detergent, cleaned everything and prepared for the 6 week wait to clear things up.  Nope, it got worse.  Might have been made even worse because I also have a severe tree pollen allergy and started having a bad reaction to my antihistammines, so I stopped taking them (about 2 weeks ago).\n3. It has now been almost 8 weeks and the rash is spreading slowly across my chest and is still on the back of my neck/ear area.  The chest rash is pussy, dense and overall looks horrendous but no longer burns.  I've been moisturizing it daily (google suggested it) and even tried some of the medicated cream my fiance was prescribed as well as over the counter steroid cream - only for a few days, but it didn't seem to help.\n\nIn the last 2 weeks I did change my hair conditioner, as the conditioner on my list that I could get my hands on (I'm in Canada) was terrible and killing my hair.  I very carefully checked the ingredients for any fragrence, essential oils, or any type of \"glucoside\" but I'm wondering if I'm missing another word for some of these chemicals and it might just be making things worse!\n\nThe ingredients are:  Purified Water (Aqua), Brassica alcohol & Brassicamidopropyl dimethylamine & Aspartic acid, Caprylhydroxamic acid & Caprylyl glycol & Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol & Polysorbate 60, Apple Cider Vinegar, Lactic acid, EDDS- Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Melissa Officinalis (Lemon balm) Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\nEspecially with trying to navigate this Covid-19 thing where almost every soap and sanitizer has fragrance, this has been a nightmare. :(  Any advice, especially from those with these allergies would be so so appreciated.\n\n**TLDR: My contact dermatitis rash is not getting better (arguably worse) after 8 weeks and I'm wondering what other names Linalool, Decyl Glucoside, and to a lesser extent Chromium and Gold might hide under in my products.  Also looking for advice on how to help the rash along.**",

All the products from the brand are free from sulphates, parabens, mineral oil, and silicones.\n\nGOAT MILK SHAMPOO ENRICHED WITH PEA PROTEIN AND JASMINE HYDROSOL\nThis shampoo is one of their best sellers and is loved by many.\nI had purchased this on the recommendation of @shwetavijaynair and @theslickbeauty .\n\nThe shampoo contains goat milk as the main ingredient which is known to be e Sona racing along with hydrolyzed pea protein and Jasmine hydrosol . All these ingredients work  really well together for dull, dry and damaged hair.\nThis retails for rupees 590 for 200ml and can be used for  6 months after opening.\n\nMy experience:\nüêëbeing a sulphate free shampoo this forms up really well which helps to clean scalp well.\nüêë Usually it is difficult to remove oil with the sulphate free shampoo but this does the job really well with such a little quantity.\nüêë the shampoo contains a heavenly fragrance which uplifts your more but can be over drink for someone if you don't like strong fragrance or is allergic to Jasmine.\nüêëthis does not agree waited my hair fall in any way and help me  improving my hair quality.\nüêë As it cleanses the scalp really well, this will definitely work for oily scalp people too.\nüêë many influencers along with the brand claims it to be so moisturising that you don't need a post conditioner but in my case this fail to do so. Each and every time I had to use a conditioner along with this.\nüêë This can be a little expensive for many of us.\n\nFinal verdict :\nGoat milk shampoo is an amazing product by #vilvahstore and I will definitely recommend this to all hair types specially for dull dry and damaged hair only if it suits your budget.\n\nRatings : 4/5\n\nAvailable on #nykaa , #vanitywagon agon and  #vilvah official website.\n\nIf you are buying from vanity wagon can use my code PAMPER20 for 20% discount‚ú®\n\n#r√©el #shampooandconditioner #shwetavijaynair #theslickbeauty #vilvahproducts #vilvahstores #vilvahgoatmilkshampoo #sulphatefreeshampoo #reelindia #share #showsomelove\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/CPNIsdYnCYv/?utm_medium=share_sheet",

        "body": "Sometimes I can tolerate Pea Protein, it's a part of MediClear, a supplement that I take for the nutrients and detox precursors. But sometimes I can't. It depends on what is going on with my microbiota. \n\nA month ago my 4 and 7 year old kids got Norovirus, and although I didn't get it fully, I could tell my body was trying to fight it off because I felt weird. Immediately I had to stop the pea protein. I can tell if I am not tolerating it well when my poo and pee start to smell like fermented beans - sorry, had to go there : ) But mostly I start to get a full distended belly and my gut aches like I am being sliced with micro knives. Then I get joint pain and fatigue. Basically SIBO IBS type symptoms. \n\nI can't do dairy (except butter thankfully) so I do not do Whey protein. I need a TON TON of protein and fat. I have had the wasting type of Lyme and my collagen get's really worn down. At one time I was eating 3500-3700 calories a day and still losing tons of weight, 20 pounds below my normal low weight (no thyroid problems or parasites, I checked, just the Lyme). \n\nso...I just eat a lot of meat. Always have. \n\nWhen I was traumatized by PETA in college, I became a vegetarian and I had horrendous flares. Too many carbs and not enough fat and protein makes me float out of my body. I had major sleep paralysis and disturbing symptoms like dead people asking me to help them cross over, due to yeast and Bartonella, but I think the vegetarian diet was a big part of it. Plus I was always hungry and had to eat every hour.\n\nI love beans too, I can always tolerate lentils and beans but the pea protein is harder for me. Nuts are good, but they are so expensive now! \n\nRecently I started snacking on kid pouches with beef liver. I like liver but I can only eat a tiny bit at a time, so any way to sneak it in I am all for. Lot's of Pho and bone broth too. Been thinking about adding in beef liver capsules.\n\nHowever, we are all different. Some people with Lyme (or any chronic disease) cannot eat that much meat, they can't digest it well. Some people can't eat any cow foods! Some people thrive with more plants and less animals. \n\nBut always I'd look at the diet and see what foods you can add in that are protein rich. Can you do scrambled eggs with ham? Turkey lettuce rollups? Cucumbers and salmon salad (like tuna salad with the mayo, celery, onion but with a super yummy salmon like the Raincost Wild Pink Salmon? It comes with the skin on and with bones in it, you have to clean it, but the flavor is 1000x better than any other canned salmon. Of course even wild fish will have the possibility of metals so I eat it once a month. Can you do nut butters?\n\nBest of luck and tell us what you find : )",

This is why, however, the United States üá∫üá∏ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't require food manufacturers to indicate the trans fat content of certain foods if they contain monoglycerides but no triglycerides. https://naturalpedia.com/monoglycerides-toxicity-side-effects-diseases-and-environmental-impacts.html\n\n-ü´ÅHYDROGENATED  or FRACTIONATED OIL \n‚óèINFLAMMATION \n-Palm Oil \n-Palm Kernel Oil \n-Soybean Oil \n-Corn Oil \n-Canola Oil\n\nAll of these are basically different names to hide ingredients that either contain MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG) or form MSG during processing: \nsaveourbones.com/12-dangerous-ingredients/\n\n food.allwomenstalk.com/harmful-additives-in-food-to-avoid-that-might-be-causing-your-stomach-problems/\n- CARRAGEEN \n-MODIFIED CORNSTARCH \n-YEAST EXTRACT \n-DISODIUM GUANYLATE \n-DISODIUM INOSINATE \n-CASEINATE \n-TEXTURED PROTEIN \n-HYDROLYZED PEA PROTEIN \nThe entire process of creating GMO's may produce ‚óèCarcinogens, ‚óèAllergens, and ‚óèToxins.

    "body": "Hi, my curls are in need of some protein and I happened to stumble across this leave-in, but there's not many reviews to be found about it (it is by a Polish company). All of the ingredients seem to be CGM friendly. My worry is that it contains keratin and hydrolized keratin, and from what I've heard, keratin can make your curls loosen. I totally don‚Äôt want this. Can that happen in this instance?:( I've heard keratin is a good choice of protein but I'm not sure if this is different from the results of a keratin treatment (those ones do indeed make your curls disappear.)\n\nI have tried posting this on the main curly hair sub, but it was taken down immediately most probably because i mentioned the word loosen\n\nThe product is Anwen Protein Orchid. I used isitcg.com but I will still leave the ingredient list, because a lot of the ingredients said \"probably ok\". If anyone who has more knowledge than me regarding these ingredients and if there's something that may do more harm than good, please let me know.

    "body": "For context, my two favorite hair care lines are gisou and Garnier honey treasures. Completely different ends of the price spectrum, but I find them to both work incredibly well on my wavy, fine hair. I've been using the gisou shampoo and conditioner for over a year now, and it makes my hair so healthy. I have an issue however-I've noticed that whenever I use it, I shed WAY more than usual. Recently I switched back to Garnier just to try it, and I immediately stopped shedding like that when washing. Why might this be? I'd assume it has something to do with the Garnier having sulfates and therefore effectively cleansing my scalp, but I honestly don't know. Here's the ingredients for both:\nGisou: \nAqua (Water/Eau), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glyceryl Laurate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil,Glycerin, Parfum (Fragrance), Mel (Honey/Miel)*,Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Arginine,Creatine, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid (Sunflower Seed) Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Decyl Glucoside, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Guar\nHydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride,Polyquaternium-10, Xanthan Gum,Hydroxypropyltrimonium Inulin, Caramel,Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol, CI 14700 (Red 4), CI 19140(Yellow 5), Coumarin**, Hexyl Cinnamal**,Limonene**, Linalool*\n\nGarnier: AQUA / WATER/EAU,\nSODIUM LAURETH SULFATE,\nSODIUM LAURYL SULFATE, COCAMIDE MEA,GLYCOL DISTEARATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE,PARFUM /FRAGRANCE, DIMETHICONE,citriC acid, sodium BENzOATe,PPG-5-CETETH-20, SODIUM HYDROXIDE,coco-Betaine, GLYCERIN, CARBOMeR,SALICYLIC ACID,\nGUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE\n,MEL / HONEY / MIEL,BENZYL ALCOHOL,COUMARIN, LIMONENE,\nBENZYL SALICYLATE, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, CERA ALBA/BEESWAX/CIRE DABEILLE,CARAMEL, FUMARIC ACID, MEL EXTRACT/HONEY EXTRACT, CI 19140/YELLOW 5, POTASSIUM SORBATE",
