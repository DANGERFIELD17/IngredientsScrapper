I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long üòÇ\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ‚ú®Ô∏èthe search bar‚ú®Ô∏è as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏è First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏è Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out üôÉ)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench ‚Äì 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details.

    "body": "Hi guys! Long time lurker here, finally decided to post my first review! A little background about my skin: I have combination skin, leaning towards oily (especially during these summer months). I've been using this sub as a guide in my quest to \"perfect\" my routine. While the journey was quite expensive, I've learned that my skin tends to react that a number of common ingredients (most AHAs and BHAs are too harsh for me, coconut oil and most of derivatives, niacinamide, essential oils, high concentrations of hyaluronic acid). I was getting frustrated as I just needed a perfectly effective and safe toner for my nitpicky skin. Lo and behold--\n\n**TONER**: **ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner**\n\nWhile this might not be popular on this sub, it seems to be well loved in Korea (EXO's Suho is known to use this toner, I've also come across a few youtubers who swore by it). Heartleaf or Houttuynia Cordata Extract has been a rising ingredient lately. It's known to soothe sensitive skin, protect the skin from external irritations, and maintain oil-moisture balance.\n\n***Does it live up to its claims?*** Yes. After using this toner for 2.5 weeks, I've noticed that my skin texture is smoother after weeks of mask acne. I've been developing constant ccs due to the trapped humidity and heat of the mask around my jaw, but this toner has calmed down a lot of my irritation and texture. The consistency is very watery, so I often put 2-3 layers and I've found that my skin has been generally more resilient throughout the day (less redness, less oil). Most youtubers seem to use it for toner masking, which I will soon try! It does seem to be more soothing than hydrating, but hydrating nonetheless. I find myself waking up to completely replenished skin when I pair it with my SIDMOOL Royal Honey Peptide Deep Moisture Pack. This toner has reached HG status.\n\n***Any cons?*** It is quite pricey at $26.00 for 250 ml, some sites even have it listed as $30-45. I personally find it worth it, as I've tried too many to count that did not work for me (PKY, soonjung, cezanne, hada labo, kiku). It is also less accessible, but I know yesstyle recently started carrying their whole line and for the cheapest available price!\n\n*Full List of Ingredients:*\n\n*Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Panthenol, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract,* ***Butylene Glycol***\\*, Vitex Agnus-Castus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Malus Domestica Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Isopentyldiol, Methylpropanediol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA\\*\n\nThe ingredients are very clean-- as reiterated throughout their branding. Unless you have an allergy to any of the extracts, or an extreme sensitivity to butylene glycol (which I sometimes do have, but this toner seems to work as butylene is farther down the list), I can't see it wreaking havoc on most skin. Perhaps, the worst case is it does nothing. YMMV of course (!!), but I've never been so impressed with a product that I've been compelled to post about it. Sensitive skin girls, unite! Thank you for reaching the bottom of this page. <3",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews.

For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s.

Just following their ‚Äòfood guide‚Äô will help more so than these over priced proprietary blend pills, and going by some who have previously commented, when they took these pills they experienced terrible stomach pains, and spent more time on the toilet than normal. \n\nFlaxseed can cause digestive issues if you don't drink enough water, and it appears these huns cannot drink water withaddong some other kind of sweet powder to it.\n\nPsyllium husk can cause abdominal pain, bloating, gas.\n\nAlfalfa powder can cause stomach upset, diarrhea, intestinal gas, stomach cramps, hormonal imbalances, and can interact with some medications.\n\nBlack walnut hulk can cause digestive issues, skin irritation and if you have a tree nut allergy, do not consume.\n\nDandelion root extract can cause stomach discomfort, diarrhea, and heartburn amongst other side effects.\n\nBurdock root extract can cause skin rashes, and increase blood sugar if too much is taken.\n\nBlessed Thistle powder can cause vomiting if too much is taken, and should not be taken by anyone with allergies to ragweed.\n\nWormwood powder, again, digestive upset if too much is taken. Do not take if you're on seizure medications.\n\nGentian powder, some stomach upset and skin rash are some common side effects.\n\nMilk Thistle extract, gastrointestinal issues, headaches, and allergic reactions.\n\nSkullcap leaf, possible side effects are a decline in memory or thinking skills (that tracks for huns), stomach pain, and sleepiness.\n\nBeetroot powder, can have side effects such as causing kidney stones, upset stomach, gout.\n\nI doubt they‚Äôve added enough of any of these powders to cause much damage, but the problem with a proprietary blend is that there is no control over how much of any of the above will find its way into these capsules.

I'm kinda disappointed that the blender wasn't especially made to match the design of the line. :p \n\nI really want to try anything with artemisia, but I'm currently focused on going through my stash. I'm looking forward to testing Missha's in the future. \n\nAnd oh, the Peach Comfort Skin Lotion looks pretty yummy. Plus points for being pretty cheap, too. It would probably work great as a mist. Their hatomugi lotion is probably better for dry skin because of the hydrolyzed royal jelly protein and the exclusion of alcohol, right? While Naturie's will work for oily skin because it contains alcohol for faster absorption. \n\nThank you as always for updating us on new releases!",

    "body": "Hello! Good morning, & how do you all do?\n\nToday I am going to be delving into skincare! In particular, the indie skincare brand, **Chikyu**. You can find the storefront on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Chikyu?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=572367388) as well as a personal business [website](https://chikyuskincare.com/). For thorough information about each ingredient & benefits please check the site listings. I haven‚Äôt even made a dent in the items I want to try from the catalog, but I feel as if I have acquired enough product (purchasing & through generous samples) that it was time to do reviews. Be prepared for a rave fest! Also I might break this up in different posts, to keep it from being a slog of reading.\n\nTAT was incredibly swift. The packaging is *the most* thoughtfully packaged item I have ordered from a skincare company. Everything was wrapped so delicately in tissue paper & securely, all secured with a beautiful knotted silky type rope. I have ordered three times now, & there has been a generous amount of sizable samples included each time! Before I even get into the quality of the product itself, I have to mention the quality of the containers & labeling. Absolutely as if you were ordering from a high end, big brand, but in my humble opinion, better than that! \n\nAbout my skincare, if it is of any use. As I have gotten older, my skin requirements have started to change, & I now consider myself in the mature skin category. I can get a mild breakout from time to time if I am on my cycle & irritate my skin at the same time, but it is not as sensitive as it was in my twenties. I do require products that are heavier in terms of moisturizing, & probably have for a while now without realizing it. My main issues are sebaceous filaments, milia on my cheeks, hyperpigmentation, & dry patches. Wrinkles I don‚Äôt see as an issue, just a part of aging, although I do want to be proactive at not accelerating them any quicker than need be.\n\nNow let the reviewing commence!!\n\n# Utsukushii ‚ÄúINDIGO Elixir‚Äù ‚Äì Fortifying Night Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nIngredients: Rice Bran Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, Olive Squalane, Papaya Oil, Shiso-Yo (Japanese Perilla Oil), \\*White Chia Oil,\\*Coconut Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, , Blue Tansy, Jasminum Sambac, Vitamin E, Poris Cocos Mushroom, Marine Algae, Rice Ferment Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Pseudocollagen,\n\nAlright folks. This is *the* product that drew me into this brand in the first place. I had been searching for some time, for a blue tansy face serum or a balm. After some deliberation & searching this subreddit for past reviews, I actually found a raving review on this exact product & with communication from the OP I was confident in going in on a FS.\n\nAs you will find out with a lot of the products, this one is a staple in my routine now. The FS comes in a beautiful, quality glass dropper style bottle. The serum goes a long way, & while it feels very moisturizing, it is lightweight & sinks into the skin fairly quickly. The smell is slightly earthy, which I enjoy. It has a very soothing quality & it does not just sit on top of the face. I was worried about the coconut oil, but I am almost done with my first FS bottle (heavy handed use) & I have not had any adverse reactions to it. I do find that my hair tends to absorb the oils at night, but actually I feel as if it has been helping my dry hair so win/win! I apply this only at night, right after a bukachoil serum from another store. I recommend trying sample sizes or a trial size before committing to a FS though, because I did find I have a preference between three of the serums I have tried.\n\n# Indigo (Silk) Face Cream\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n30ml/1oz (Full Size)\n\n7.4ml/.25oz (Trial/Miniature Size)\n\n1.5ml (Sample Size/Skin Tester)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n\\*Calendula Hydrosol, Marula Oil, Prickly Pear Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, \\*Calendula Oil, \\*Rose Hip Oil, \\*Aloe Leaf, \\*Coconut Oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil, Witch Hazel, Sunflower Seed Oil, \\*White Willow Bark, \\*Neem Oil, Pseudocollagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Phyto Peptide Complex (Plant Based Peptides), Silk Amino Peptides, Blue Tansy (Moroccan Chamomile ESO), Klamath Blue Algae, Caprylic Triglyceride (Coconut based), Stearic Acid (Plant Sourced), Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Palmarosa Oil, May Chang fruit oil, Benzoin Resin oil, Cedarwood Bark Oil. Magnesium, NonGMO Soybean Germ Extract.\\*Rosemary ESO, Vitamin E, \\*Vegetable Glycerin, Radish Root ESO\n\nI had originally received this as a sample in my first order & ended up ordering a FS. I usually use a different brand of face moisturizer that I honestly prefer over this one. Although for reasons unknown to me, the shop never followed through with shipping out of my order & even though there were communications with the other shop owner, I still don‚Äôt know if I am getting my package or a refund as informed. Either way, with that in mind, I ordered a FS of this because as a replacement, this one fits the bill nicely & Chikyu is always extremely reliable. It doesn‚Äôt feel as moisturizing as my preferred, but it also doesn‚Äôt leave my skin feeling dry by any means. It isn‚Äôt greasy & absorbs fairly quickly. The size is in my opinion slightly smaller than I had imagined, but a little really does go a long way, especially if you are also using her other products. The container is quality glass like her other FS products. I think the price is reasonable though, because this one is packed full of vastly more beneficial ingredients comparatively. So I would definitely recommend this to someone who doesn‚Äôt like a heavy moisturizer. There is a mushroom moisturizer that I am more interested in trying, so before I finish this container, I will order a sample of that one to see if it is better suited for me. Until then I will continue to use this product.\n\n# Hakumai Mizu ‚ÄúRice/Pearl‚Äù Face Cleanser\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar with Bamboo Fibers)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar without Bamboo Fibers)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Fermented Rice Water\\*, Coconut Oil\\*, Lavender Flower Extract\\*, Rose Hip Oil, Castor Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Matsutake Mushroom Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple Fruit Essence), Wild Burdock Root Extract\\*, Crushed Pearl Powder, Rice Ferment Peptides, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Bamboo Fibers, \\*Grey Sea Salt, Glucose (Sugar Based), Vitamin C, Vegetable Glycerin\\*, Sake, Stearic Acid (Plant Derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Gum, NataPres (Radish Root, Honeysuckle, Aspen Bark).\n\nI had also originally received a sample of this & ended up FS. I really love this cleanser. The sample does not come with the option for the bamboo fibers, & when I ordered a larger size I opted for the bamboo fibers. This is an extremely sizeable glass container for how little you need to use. It has a pearlescent sheen to it that is extremely beautiful. The bamboo fibers are delicate, but abrasive enough to scrub the skin without having to apply much pressure on your face when rubbing it in. I did notice that using this alone as a cleanser left my skin feeling stripped more than I would like. So with that in mind the next product I will review compliments this one. This is definitely a staple, but I am very curious about her other cleansers & plan on sampling the others to see if I have a preference. I am especially interested in the Matcha Cleanser.\n\n# Facial Cleansing Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 4oz (Full Size)\n\n1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Meadowfoam Oil, \\*Camellia Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Castor Oil, \\*Rose Geranium ESO, Multifruit BSC\n\nI love this cleansing oil. This is admittedly my first foray into double cleansing & boy do I feel like a dingus for not having done this before! In my opinion, if you use the rice/pearl cleanser, this one is a must to use beforehand. I have noticed with consistent use, that my face is left feeling more moisturized & better cleansed than if I had just used the other alone. A little goes a long way, the FS is a glass pump container that is sizeable. No matter what cleanser I use, I will always have this in my routine. The smell is delicate, & does not irritate my skin whatsoever. I highly recommend trying a sample of this product. The sample I originally ordered was enough to carry me through three weeks of heavy handed use. I have no plans on looking for another cleansing oil. I will continue to use this as long as Lyn sells it!\n\n# Kagayakimasu ‚ÄúGLOW‚Äù Face Elixir\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Watermelon Oil, \\*Cucumber Seed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, \\*Olive Oil, \\*Hemp Seed Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, \\*Tamanu Oil, Wheat Germ Oil,Geranium ESO, Lavender ESO, Grapefruit ESO, Pseudocollagen\n\nThe sample size container reminds me of my previous career in histopathology working with antibodies in immunohistochemistry. It‚Äôs a little flip top, sturdy, plastic container, but isn‚Äôt flat on the bottom. Something you would have in a rack while you pipette. Alright, I wanted to love this one. It smells absolutely gorgeous! But it felt way too heavy on my face, almost greasy. I am glad I only ordered a sample size of this, because I did start getting some clogged pores & small breakouts on my chin & forehead after using this one. I will mention that I had started my cycle right after trying this one, so that really could have been the culprit, but my face didn‚Äôt feel as irritated after I stopped using it. I just don‚Äôt feel like this one is for me & that is ok! I believe it is well loved by others here & obviously on her multiple reviews on both store sites. I plan on using up the sample on my d√©colletage‚Ä¨ area & hands. \n\n# Liquid Moisture\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Cranberry Seed Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Marula Oil, Baobab Oil, \\*Pumpkin Seed Oil, \\*Borage Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Neroli ESO, Jasmine Grandiflorum Absolute, Jasmine Flowers, Pseudocollegen\n\nI ordered the trail size of this product & it comes in a cute little glass dropper style bottle. This serum specifically states on the listing that it will not clog pores & is intended for dry skin. I love this one just as much as the Indigo serum. I would say this is the lightest, in terms of weight & oiliness it leaves on the face compared to the other two. It feels as if it sinks in faster than the other two. I do prefer to use a bit more in my hand to get an even layer spread out, but it is perfect for adding it underneath my daily moisturizer. I only wear this one in the morning since it is so lightweight. I plan on purchasing a FS of this on my next order. Although I am curious about the Silk Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love everything about Chikyu. From the amazing customer service, the high quality & intention with each creation, the reliability of knowing I will receive my products & that the turn around time is consistently quick, & the fact that is actually making my skin feel better. In regards to my skincare needs, I have seen a significant reduction in the milia I usually have on my cheekbones, my dry patches that I tend to get on the sides of my nose/under eye area are not an issue, & with proper usage of cleansing & adequate moisturizing of my face, my blackhead/sebaceous filaments have become less apparent. I did not realize that I was over-cleansing & under-moisturizing my face before & that was what was making my pores look so raggedy & sad! Also, my hands have been feeling the love & are not scary lizard skin looking like before. They are soft & happy!! I highly, highly recommend at the very least, ordering some samples if you are curious. There is so much to try, that I am positive you will find something that works for you. If you made it this far, thank you for reading my thoughts!! I would absolutely love to hear about anyone else's experience with Chikyu products, especially ones I haven‚Äôt mentioned! I do have a lot more product samples I haven‚Äôt touched yet, & plan on leaving another review eventually! I tried to be thorough & I hope I didn't leave anything out! Have a nice day!",

The Rice/Pearl face cleanser is a staple of my routine now-- it's so gentle but strong at the same time and completely blank slates my skin, along with the Vita-plus eye cream. Husband and I both have noticed a big difference in how much less sunken and worn my undereyes are since I started using the cream daily about a week and a half ago. I also have the Tsubaki overnight mask which I haven't used enough yet to see any big changes, but the formula itself is creamy and light, and doesn't feel bad or sticky when you leave it on to sleep.",

I used to use lots of skincare, and I was having horrible allergic reactions, so I quit using everything and now only wash and moisturize my face. Are these products scented? Or better question, do they have added scent? Some look like they do, so I was wondering if it is a strong scent? Or maybe those are actually active ingredients and I just don‚Äôt know! I would like to use a indie face cream and wash, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth the trial and error",

My skin is sort of... well I don't know. I took accutane when I was a teen and it really changed my skin to not be as acne prone (i mean honestly it has made me acne free for 10 years)  but I noticed recently that my oil glands have all come back from that and it kinda freaks me out. I have oily skin again. Not pimples but more clogged pores, irritation and redness than before.   \n\n\nToo bad about the glow serum, that was one that I was interested in, but I don't wanna chance breaking out.

The Longevity moisturizer is my favorite and I seriously can't live without it.  Before then, I was using Estee Lauders Revitalizing Supreme moisturizing cream with no difference in my skin until I started using Chikyu's Longevity cream.  Let me say, there is no comparison. The Longevity cream is magic and I will use it forever!  My second favorite is their Cleansing oil. This is AMAZE BALLS and my face adores it, especially after a long day at work wearing make up.  My skin screams THANK YOU every time I wash my face with it.  The scent is of faint rose and the oil leaves my skin unbelievably soft.  Astonishingly, I find with all the Chikyu face products I have ever used, none have been scented, and if it is, it's definitely natural.",

salicylate\n\n\n\n- I was using Lait VIP o2 until I realized it contained alcohol and have since switched to Lait U. I did enjoy Lait VIP o2 but I don‚Äôt believe in using products with alcohol for extended periods of time so that‚Äôs why I decided to switch and Lait U is very gentle. \n\n- I was recommend complexe iribiol for pimples I get from time to time. Yes, it clears it up very quickly, but the second ingredient is alcohol denat and I would get rough patches on my skin if I used it multiple days in a row. \n\n- I do love Masque Vivant although it also contains denatured alcohol. Since I only use it about 3 times a week for about 30 min I have decided it‚Äôs of low risk to my skin since the alcohol is a little bit lower on the list. \n\n- Masque vip o2 does seem to make the skin around my eyes a little brighter but I have a pimple right near my eye that won‚Äôt seem to go away. After looking at the ingredient list and seeing mink oil as the 5th ingredient it makes sense since mink oil is very comedogenic. \n\n- I love lotion MC 110 N*1, and since I doesn‚Äôt contain any alcohol I will continue to use. It really plumps my skin and gives me a glow. It is meant to be used after your P50 lotion (toner). \n\n- I was recommended P50 PIGM400 for my skin and it does lighten my skin and make it feel super balanced. After looking at the ingredients though, it also contains denatured alcohol and therefore after I finish this bottle I will move on to the regular P50 (without phenol) since it doesn‚Äôt contain alcohol. \n\n- The placenta serum is probably my favorite. It hydrates and heals my skin and I also use it on my eyes during the day. \n\n- The PIGM400 serum is just ok. It also contains alcohol and I feel like my other products have lightened my dark spots from recents acne more than this serum. It also contains some ingredients that can cause acne. \n\n- Creme Dermopurifiante makes my skin glow when I use it and it does great with skin that is acne prone but it also contains alcohol so for me, using it long term is a no go. \n\n\n\n",

I'm listing the prices converted from the retail price in Korea so you can see whether you're outrageously overpaying if you do decide to go look for any of these online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SIDMOOL**\n\nMost products from this brand seem to fragrance-free. They're quite popular in Korea, it looks like. Sensitive skin-friendly, mid-range to very affordable price, good performance/rave reviews. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu73nuoc8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3671e9c6328bb8cab34a24366fac08d06ace645f\n\n1. **Pure Bifida 95 Ampoule - 30ml/24,600 Won ($20.94)**\n\n*Bifida Ferment Lysate, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nBifida ferment is the \"star\" ingredient that makes up most of the famed Estee Lauder night recovery serum if you didn't know (although it matters which strain was used apparently, same with SK-II & their dupes). It's said to strengthen your skin barrier over time and provide very slight, gentle exfoliation. Reviews for this Sidmool serum I have read on the Hwahae app do confirm that many people felt their skin became \"stronger\"/less sensitive. Many also said their skin tone & texture improved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmd5qi5e8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9d487bb091642b6ee3ea1e20e2b1f4cc276b0e4\n\n2. **Skin Sauce D Panthenol Ampoule - 12ml/11,800 Won ($10.04)**\n\n*Water, Panthenol, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root (Chinese Skullcap) Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root (Tree Peony) Extract.*\n\nPanthenol is a great barrier repairing ingredient. Research shows using 5-10% is the best for skin penetration. It's said to be very healing. Note the tiny size, however. 12 ml = 0.4 oz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kc56mwli8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5deb3f6d7af94d6cd14851695dd3a721e599c8\n\n3. **Madagascar Real Moisture Cream - 80g/23,800 Won ($20.26)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica, Glycerin, Hydrogenated lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa (Tree Peony) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Chinese Skullcap) Root Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyl Undecylenate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Erythritol, Sorbitol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Asiatic acid, Astaxanthin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Vaccinium Angustifolium Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Nut Extract, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nThis lightweight gel-cream (Koreans call watery/hydrating creams \"soo boon cream\" meaning \"moisture cream\") is a crowd-pleaser, starring centella and many other soothing ingredients such as Chinese skullcap extract, allantoin, licorice root (the soothing component, not the skin-lightening), and madecassoside. It also has polyglutamic acid, beta-glucan, and hyaluronic acid as humectants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4q3uak8ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0af940dc986ca78892585f4a03d2fd7b23a3b96a\n\n4. **Honey Peptide Moisture Pack - 40ml/9,800 Won ($8.43)**\n\n*Honey Extract(40%), Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract,Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Beta-Glucan, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Trehalose, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Glucosylrutin, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\nA lightweight, gel-textured sleeping pack.

It's absolutely *stuffed full* of humectants: honey, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sugars, beta-glucan, collagen, and peptides. Some soothing ingredients as well, allantoin, licorice root & extracts. Very dry skinned people said it wasn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfr8w5oo8ku31.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdcfdfe41ba52ad5d588187902b7d00420478a4\n\n5. **Calendula Ampoule Moisture Cream - 80ml/16,800 Won ($14.30)**\n\n*Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Calendula Officinalis Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Cholesterol, Glyceryl Stearate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Tumeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Water, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Xanthan Gum, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Heptyl Undecylenate, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\nA gel-cream with skin-soothing calendula flower as the star. Other soothing, anti-inflammatory extracts make an appearance here, as well as ceramides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7f77tcs8ku31.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd7d7db952d0ec115a2a39a569a337f661ac0789\n\n6. **Idebenone Firming Ampoule - 32ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Rosa Canina (Dog-Rose) Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Adenosine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Human Oligopeptide-1, rh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Acetly Hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Ethyhexylglycerin.*\n\nIdebenone is the synthetic version of the powerful antioxidant, CoQ10/ubiquinone. CoQ10 molecules are really big though, so it has trouble penetrating. Idebenone has smaller molecules so it can do the job better. I heard that the patent on idebenone ended recently, so maybe we can see more of this goodie in future products. There are also peptides in this ampoule, as well as some soothing & firming ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdnxp8cu8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72616b051ce0532bd51287099a4e28de9871ec0f\n\n7. **Green Tea Peeling Gel - 120ml/4,800 Won ($4.09)**\n\n*Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water(10%), Glycerin, Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Betaine,Beta-Glucan, Arginine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Allantoin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Carbomer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.*\n\nThis is wildly popular, being so affordable. It's a nice, basic peeling gel. Fragranced with lavender essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cvgwgvv8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b79356fcf60cdd09f5435cd76817e90c5f036c1\n\n8. **Jojoba Lip Essence \\[Original Moisture\\] - 13ml/3,800 Won ($3.23)**\n\n*Polyisobutene, Petrolatum, Diisostearyl Malate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Microcrystalline Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Royal Jelly Extract, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Tocopheryl Acetate*\n\nThis lil' lip balm has been #1 on the Hwahae app for a while now. Which surprises me, personally, as the Korean skincare community is going through a major \"EWG is best source/natural is better\" moment right now. But hey, I guess if it works, it works. Fragranced with orange essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9arxe39ku31.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff34a25e8bccfe68e01a8ccc85e304df7b1b0826\n\n9. **Saccharo Ferment Therapy Essence - 60ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Human Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Water.*\n\nI think some of Missha fermented products use Saccharomyces. Whenever you see a ferment ingredient/whatever extract, that means that plant has been fermented to make the nutrients in it more bioavailable for us. Supposedly the fermentation process releases lots more goodies than just using the extract alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myfq67u59ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfc805f707759f790b86d6dd65460379b6c9674\n\n10. **Saccharo Ferment Sparkle First Ampoule - 100ml/49,000 Won ($41.70)**\n\n*Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nGalactomyces = SK-II, Bifida = Estee Lauder, though which strains are trade secret or something. A very simple ampoule with ferments, a humectant and some plant extracts. They do have a cream version as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0w9k8ta9ku31.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a8cd57bde651c10bf016cd3d6cea4a2799e937\n\n11. **Saccharo Essential Mist - 60ml/18,000 Won ($15.32)**\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Beta-Glucan, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6471tkd9ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5903dcfdcc876d4365879230722e61b4da4c2130\n\n12. **Honey Peptide Mist - 60ml/8,600 Won ($7.32)**\n\n*Honey Extract, Water, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\nA watery, soothing mist with honey, propolis, royal jelly, collagen and peptides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfoo0nzf9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b834384913e4a2a6161fb10bfeed8aeeee4e647\n\n13. **The Calming Essence - 50ml/18,600 Won ($15.83)**\n\nArtemisia Capillaris (Mugwort - Capillary Wormwood) Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Arginine, Cabomer, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol.\n\nA very simple, soothing mugwort, panthenol, allantoin, and licorice root essence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0fj8zdi9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=915ee84ef3cb6c1dec999de951abe84a8b268783\n\n14. **Dr. Troub Bio Repair Powder Cleanser - 60g/15,600 Won ($13.27)**\n\n*Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sobitol, Cellulose Gum, Scutellaria Bicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Artemisia Princeps (Mugwort - Korean Mugwort/Korean Wormwood) Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Human Oligopeptide-1, Acetyl hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Citric Acid, Arbutin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin.*\n\n\\[Second cleanser\\] An SLS-free powder foaming wash. The surfactants in this (Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate & Disodium Lauroyl glutamate) are extremely gentle surfactants often used for cleansers targeted toward babies and sensitive skin. They're more expensive but provide a bunch of non-stripping foam. We see a lot more of these sort of surfactants in recent years because of the bad rep Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate have gotten, which are used widely because of their cheap cost (whether they are gentle or not depends on the formula and what other surfactants they have been mixed with).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8jz1gqk9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1943c1bb896d85a41596a26febcc48e6a47a684\n\n15. **Dr. Troub Skin Returning Cleansing Milk - 200ml/13,600 Won ($11.57)**\n\n*Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Diheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Milk Protein Extract, Allantoin, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n\\[First Cleanser\\] This is a popular cleansing milk that you use like you use an oil cleanser (rub into dry face with dry hands). to remove sunscreen and makeup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w3vw2xp9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0abeef20e0d4ee0787e6101c376d2e70fbb4c3\n\n16. **Galatokside Real Peptide Barrier Moisture Soo Boon Cream - 50ml/29,800 won ($25.36)**\n\n*Copper Tripeptide-1, Glactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Polyglutamic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium PCA, Beta-Glucan, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Adenosine, Arginine, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nA nice, soothing cream with tons of humectants/peptides, and centella components. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3ur5mms9ku31.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480295636783722d34de21a551c16f1fd5a2c4d5\n\n17. **Madagascar Centella Skin - 150ml/14,800 Won ($12.59)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract(97%), Butylene Glycol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nRemember that toners are referred to as \"Skin\" in Korea (Japan = lotion). A simple, calming toner all about centella and soothing licorice and other plant extracts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jittu4x9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c068d9ca9b0ad1830d93a384cfafef950eeebe0c\n\n18. **Eggplant Ampoule - 50ml/22,800 Won ($19.40)**\n\n*Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract**,* *Water**,* *Butylene Glycol**,* *1,2-Hexanediol**,* *Fructose**,* *Sorbitol**,* *Maltitol**,* *Hyaluronic Acid**,* *Sodium Pca**,* *Lupeol**,* *Sodium Hyaluronate**,* *Hydroxyethylcellulose**,* *Sodium Chloride* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6p1j3qf0aku31.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ece7d4d75dea064bfd4febe2f0f610148e9569c\n\n19. **Ferment Care Thermal Mineral Water - 125ml/14,800 Won ($12.60)**\n\n*Onsen-sui, Morus Alba (White Mulberry) Bark Extract, Lactobacillus/Honeysuckle Flower Extract, Cimicifunga Dahurica (Black Cohosh) Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum (Chinese Rhubarb) Root/Stalk Extract, Platycodon Grandiflorus (Balloon Flower) Root Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Extract, Sophora Flavescens (Ku Shen) Root Extract, Rubia Cordifolia (Manjistha) Root Extract, Coptis Japonica (Japanese Gold Thread) Extract, Lithospermum Officinale (European Stoneseed) Extract, Taraxacum Platycarpum (Korean Dandelion) Extract, Pueraria Thunbergiana (Kudzu) Root Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum (Korean Pepper) Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana (Korean Pasque Flower) Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nI like thermal water, idk. I thought there would be more ferments in this, given the name, but I guess not. Thermal water does have a light soothing effect/deposit minerals onto your skin. I thought it was just boring water in a can too, but Labmuffin has a post on it; It's interesting. Korean Pasque Flower is called \"Hal-mi-Kkhot\" meaning \"granny flower\", lol. Because the flower part droops down towards the ground, like how grandmas walk stooped down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqs0h5n2aku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b15d061d15804a54905cf44c73c01d3c8e78da3\n\n20. **Mega Peptide Eco Hydro Soothing Cream - 60ml/28,400 Won ($24.18)**\n\n*Bambusa Vulgaris (Bamboo) Water, Copper Tripeptide-1, Glycerin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic.Capric Triglyceride, Pentapeptide-20, Nicotinoyl Tripeptide-1, sh-Octapeptide-4, sh-Decapeptide-7, sh-Oligopeptide-9, sh-Pentapeptide-19, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Panthenol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Diopyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorce) Root Extract, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Seed Oil, Propolis Extract, Chamomilla Recutica (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Olibanum, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol (Vitamin E).* \n\nSidmool sure loves peptides! This one seems just loaded. Lots of soothing/calming stuff in here as well. Unfortunately, it is fragranced with lavender essential oil, if you are sensitive to that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidmool has loads of other things but my fingers are tired ok.",

    "body": "I have very thin/fine hair. It has always been pretty healthy and I do get quite a bit of volume below my hairline. I recently got off of birth control, realized that my hair was falling out a month or so later, and then started taking my birth control again to try and stop it/fix it. I also had been using Batiste Devine Dark dry shampoo religiously. I am talking at least once a day because if I didn't use it, you could see my thinning hair at the root. I quit using that as well because I found out that it was more than likely causing irritation to my scalp. \n\nI have been working with my primary care physician on this and have gotten a full blood panel to rule out anything medical happening. She did say that my scalp looked irritated, which is why I quit the dry shampoo. She gave me a referral to a dermatologist which I am going to make an appointment for this week. \n\nI am just being very gentle and careful with my hair to try and stop it from falling out. Even this morning, I washed it for the first time in 3 days and about 12-20 strands fell out. That is pretty typical . I use Olaplex shampoo/conditioner about 2x weekly and I also use the No. 3 treatment 1x/week. My issue is that I do not want to have to increase the amount of times I have to wash my hair due to not using dry shampoo so I have been on the hunt for a new one that isn't as harsh. My hair stylist recommended R+Co SKYLINE Dry Shampoo and she used it on me once with great results. It is a non-aerosol pump bottle that emits a huge cloud of powder. It soaks into the hair nicely and doesn't seem to coat my scalp in that film that batiste created. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have included the ingredients below. My question is whether or not this is an acceptable alternative for me right now and if there is anything that might cause even more thinning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**R+Co SKYLINE Dry Shampoo**\n\n Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Kaolin, Tapioca Starch, Polysilicone-1 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Solum Diatomeae/Diatomaceous Earth/Terre De DiatomeÃÅes, Silica, [Mica](https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Mica_502247.htm), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Juniperus Communis Fruit Extract, Sodium Methoxy PEG-16 Maleate/Styrene Sulfonate Copolymer, Benzophenone-4, Aqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum/Fragrance, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citral, Citronellol, Coumarin, Eugenol, Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides).

I‚Äôm not sure what other shampoos to recommend but as someone who also struggles with thinning hair and has been to doctors and dermatologist with no luck (all they said was to try rogaine which made me nervous because of its ingredients). I will say ask your stylist or search around for someone who has experience styling thin hair. I did a few months back and she recommended I try out some toppers (or as I like to refer to them as ‚Äúclip in extensions‚Äù). Trust me I was hesitant at first because I didn‚Äôt think I needed them but it actually blended pretty well (much better than a wig). Best of luck in the struggle.

Ok.\nReview time~!\n\n\n**Product Info:**\n\nShara Shara\n\nHoney Bomb All In One Ampoule\n\n250ml\n\n**Claims:**\n\n* Combines three steps (toner, serum and moisturizer)\n\n* Hydrates\n\n* Improves skin texture\n\n* Whitening (brightening)\n\n* Anti-aging\n\n[Ingredients:](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_0e10177275.html) (CosDNA link)\nWater, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Diglycerin, Betaine, Pentylene Glycol, Polyquaternium-51, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Propolis Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Pueraria Thunbergiana Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Paeonia Lactiflora Root Extract, Cnidium Officinale Root Extract, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Hamamelis Virginiana Flower Water, Soluble Collagen, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated Starch, Hydrolysate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Xanthan Gum, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Disodium Edta, Caramel, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Acacia Senegal Gum, Folic Acid, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol, Raffinose\n\n**Results:**\n\nI normally have dehydrated, dry and very dull skin around this time of year. I have quite a bit of products that help with that and they do help don't get me wrong, but this baby? Whew~! It adds quite a glow to the skin regardless of how I use it. When I do use it as a mask or sleeping pack I do wake up with a bit more hydration than just slapping it on, but that is expected. As I stated, I've been using this since November and I've barely scratched the surface! Luckily I have 12 months to use this! I've soaked cottons in this and given them to my mom (she has super dull skin) and now she expects them every time I visit -.-\n\nI can't say much on anti-aging as I don't have really fine lines or wrinkles yet (YET), but I can say it definitely hydrates and brightens the skin. It definitely helps when I'm in such a rush to get out the door but don't want to leave my skin dry all day~! \n\nI also put mine in the fridge as I've mentioned and man oh man does it help to not only add a glow to my face but the cooling helps waken my tired eyes up!\n\n**Pros:**\n\nHydrates\n\nBrightens skin\n\nCan be used in quite a few ways\n\nTONS of product\n\nNo heavy scent\n\nFeels light on skin\n\n**Cons:**\n\n$40 could be a bit pricey to some\n\nOnly the ingredients are in English",

Just 4 months ago my routine was Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser and 1% Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion in the morning, and Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser and Epiduo at night. No sunscreen, no moisturizer... I've always had a multitude of issues, but since I wasn't getting cystic breakouts anymore thanks to Epiduo, that was good enough for me at the time. \n\nIN A NUTSHELL: Back in April I used Dr. Bronner's Tea Tree Castile Liquid soap to wash my face at my sister's recommendation. I thought hey, it's supposedly all-natural, seemed like there wouldn't be a huge chance of it breaking me out if I just used it once. \n\nMy face IMMEDIATELY dried out so badly, I couldn't crack a smile. And here I am with NO MOISTURIZER. I slapped on some Clindamycin lotion and hoped for the best.\n\nI woke up the next morning with the beginnings of 3 cystic pimples alongside my nose (my first in a year and a half!), closed comedones all over my nose and forehead, open comedones all over my chin, and suddenly my prescriptions seriously BURNED to put on when they hadn't before. \n\nAaaaaaaaand that's when I decided to start frequenting SCA! \n\nOn to Paula's Choice Pore-Reducing Toner:\n\nI seriously owe you guys one--I never would have ever tried out, or probably ever heard of PC if I hadn't seen her recommended all over this sub. I went on a bit of a sample-size frenzy on her website one day and started patch-testing them one by one. One sample in particular gave me results in the 1 spot of my chin I tested it on in just 4 days: the SKIN BALANCING PORE-REDUCING TONER.\n\nDoes it actually reduce pores?? Not really. But here are just a few of the ingredients: Niacinamide!!!, Glycerin, Burdock Root Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed jojoba esters, and CERAMIDES, woo.\n\nSince using it regularly all over my face, starting only two weeks ago:    \n*The closed comedones on my chin and nose have all gone away.  \n*The redness leftover from the cysts by my nose and the breakouts on my chin are so faded it is SCARY  \n*My skin no longer burns when I apply Epiduo or my sunscreen that I'm now using every day  \n*My face in general is less red and doesn't look shiny after just 2 hours anymore??? Like I can sleep a full 8 hours, look in the mirror the next morning and I DON'T look like a stoplight. That is huge for me.  \n\nSo ummmmmmmmm TL;DR: Try out this toner if you have skin that sounds like mine was. Seriously. Or if you just want niacinamide and ceramides without any fatty alcohols.\n\nThe rest of my 100% SCA-inspired routine for anyone interested:\n\nAM:  \n*I put on a mask of raw honey and grapeseed oil and let it sit for 5 minutes while I eat breakfast/drink coffee. This keeps my skin moisturized and calm the WHOLE DAY.  \n*Wash off the mask with water + charcoal konjac sponge  \n*PC Pore-Reducing Toner  \n*Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 55 (This is just OK. It doesn't break me out and dries matte. I'm trying out physical sunscreens but haven't found one I like yet!)  \n*Makeup, usually just bareMinerals foundation and mineral veil.  \n\nPM:   \n*Paula's Choice Earthsourced Perfectly Natural Gel Cleanser, my only other purchase based on the sample-frenzy I went on and ANOTHER REALLY REALLY GREAT PRODUCT.  \n*PC Pore-Reducing Toner again.  \n*Epiduo  \n*Cetaphil moisturizer in the tub.  \n\nTHE END!",

I just started Epiduo last week, and all my moisturizers burn now. How long have you been using Epiduo? And does the Cetaphil burn or irritate your face now? I've read that Epiduo will irritate your skin for the first few weeks, and my face is indeed very red and dry right now. I want to slather lotion all over my face but it burns! How long was it before you could use the Cetaphil and not have it burn like crazy?",

Its featured ingredient is Tremella funciformis (white wood ear fungus), a traditional Chinese (I'm assuming Korean too but I'm Chinese where I first heard of it) ingredient for healthy skin (when eaten at least). It has a interesting botanicals notably Centella asiatica which has been very popular lately, and licorice root extract which is known for brightening. It also includes probiotics and humectants (glycerin, collagen, sodium hyaluronate) . I'm stocking up by getting myself another bottle so I would repurchase! But I haven't used it consistently enough to really discuss its effects on my skin.\n\ncaution if you can't tolerate niacinamide or are sensitive to plant extracts or fragrance citrus oils. I personally don't think it's heavily fragranced (scent not sensitivty)\n\nAdditional notes: IMO this is a great deal and better quality than a lot of western moisturizers (in the way that it doesn't have silicones). I'm looking at you Origins Night-a-mins. It's thinner than night-a-mins by a bit but also is less fragranced and has more humectants (glycerin, collagen, sodium hyaluronate) if you love plant extracts try it out\n\nIngredients:\nWATER, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER, NIACINAMIDE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, FICUS CARICA (FIG) FRUIT EXTRACT, PHELLINUS LINTEUS EXTRACT, ARCTIUM LAPPA ROOT EXTRACT, PORIA COCOS SCLEROTIUM EXTRACT, EPILOBIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM FLOWER/LEAF/STEM EXTRACT,PORTULACA OLERACEA EXTRACT, PUERARIA THUNBERGIANA ROOT EXTRACT, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, PAEONIA LACTIFLORA ROOT EXTRACT,CNIDIUM OFFICINALE ROOT EXTRACT, LACTOBACILLUS/SOYBEAN FERMENT EXTRACT, DIOSCOREA JAPONICA ROOT EXTRACT, TREMELLA FUCIFORMIS (MUSHROOM) EXTRACT, SOLUBLE COLLAGEN, CITRUS AURANTIUM DULCIS (ORANGE) OIL, CITRUS LIMON (LEMON) FRUIT OIL, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CYMBOPOGON SCHOENANTHUS OIL, CITRUS AURANTIUM BERGAMIA (BERGAMOT) FRUIT OIL, CYMBOPOGON NARDUS (CITRONELLA) OIL, GERANIUM MACULATUM OIL, CARBOMER, TROMETHAMINE, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, ADENOSINE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, CERAMIDE 3, SUCROSE DISTEARATE, PANTHENOL,FOLIC ACID,CHOLESTEROL, RAFFINOSE, PALMITOYL PENTAPEPTIDE-4\n\n",

        "body": "It looks like a somewhat gentle cleanser, but I don't think this shampoo will help much with dandruff.  The herbs included aren't particularly antifungal, and dandruff is often caused by fungal overgrowth.  If you want a gentle, natural shampoo that's going to help fight dandruff, you might try the [Faith in Nature rosemary shampoo](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/faith-in-nature-rosemary-shampoo-60019691), or a tea tree oil shampoo like [Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Giovanni-Cosmetics-Triple-Invigorating-Conditioner/dp/B0011UVCKU/ref=sr_1_15_sspa?crid=BD3ZMNERYDBT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.pm4KXp9UQKtRLRg9wTgATx_Gl-us353mbx7opTGWVJOAdSL-n8Lmd4voFuXt7PeQhWjp3_fseu2wUJm3RfQeDa3nQ_s1DWfGZxperZU2eIwAaLLBTHPy8XoFaINn2sxjBdmzPswkcr6wqB95MXD0oThIK_YS25GnnZS6KB4tBAZPsL_mSPbMRVeSbwyuLrPeENIPU20bYwEjqfOw9zorRYESQK3hgPqu3w0eaVxJmgfyejQxGxqzX_YuUWsB7Zk-R1EYfsphZL47gj_E5XHCOW_YodHK9fBa-AVtD_hUUYc.KdqC32l0HqTX4rFNB9ysF8fTZuphx1zBl8-ni7pDWsY&dib_tag=se&keywords=giovanni+tea+tree+shampoo&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1729591824&refresh=1&sprefix=giovanni+tea+tree%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-15-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&psc=1).  (I'm using UK amazon links as I'm assuming that you're in the UK because of the Holland & Barrett link.) You would need to moisturize your hair after shampooing somehow; there is a section in the wiki of this sub for natural moisturizers.  I don't recommend diluting the shampoo to minimize the drying effect, because then you'd also be diluting the concentration of the herbs which can help fight the dandruff.  Another option is to try co-washing with a tea tree oil conditioner instead; the Giovanni tea tree oil conditioner is a great option for this.  It wouldn't dry out the hair and you'd get the same benefit of the antifungal herbs.  Co-washing involves applying conditioner as if it's shampoo, massaging it really well into the scalp and hair, which can help break up some of the oil and buildup because conditioners have gentle cleansing agents in them as well, and oils can break down other oils.\n\nDo you do any mechanical cleaning to maintain the scalp, or are you just rinsing your hair with water?  If you don't currently do mechanical cleaning, it's an important aspect of scalp care in No Poo hair washing.  There is an article linked in the side column on Water Only washing that explains what's involved for mechanical cleaning.",

Nizoral will probably dry out your scalp but dandruff means fungal overgrowth and fungus loves moisture. If rhe dryness becomes unbearable try using less + if you have medium-long hair you can still condition the ends. The only home remedies I know for the fungus that causes this is salt water and apple cider vinegar but never tried them because most home remedies I've tried have been BS. Might also be worth looking at your lifestyle and diet and see if you've changed anything as dandruff can be triggered by other health conditions or life changes e.g. mine was triggered by a hormonal treatment but went away when I stopped. Then I got it SO bad when I was vaping daily that it even spread to my face and I had to use canesten cream on my face twice a day (my hypothesis is because vape juices usually contain sugar alcohol sweeteners and fungus likes sugar but im not a scientist so who knows lol) but again after a week of quitting all the dandruff was gone",

    "body": "So far I co-washed two times.\n\nFirst time I did it the lush way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage, wash, put significant amount of conditioner on hair from roots to ends, wait, wash. The hair was clean, I think it was too clean, there was more resistance when brushing vs after shampoo washing, there was significantly more hair left on my hands (and on the brush when brushing too I think) when applying the product. I think the hair was somewhat sticky and waxy, but not too much.\n\nThe second time I did it the easy way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage (and in the process get a bit on the hair and ends too), wait, wash. The hair was clean enough (not shampoo-clean, but I think that's better for my hair and for my scalp's accomodation). There was more resistance when brushign vs after shampoo washing (and I think also vs the first co-wash). There too was significantly more hair left on my hands when applying the product, but because it was applied only once it was this much less hair loss. My hair is sticky, waxy. It looks good, but feels really bad, because of the stickiness.\n\nI used warm water.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if I brush my hair downwards while leaning down, the hair will literally stay in the air afterwards as if I gelled it or something. This effect is present to some extent after I shampoo-wash too, but not this extremely. It's also quite difficult to brush in the first place.\n\nThe conditioner somewhat sticks to the hair even while washing with it, the consistency of conditioner is gluey, sticky, it doesn't make my fingers run through my hair with conditioner applied run buttery smoothly, but rather the complete opposite, I'm scared of pulling my hair out this way... No hair loss when rinsing it off. \n\nMy scalp is also itchy as fuck now. My guess is the preservatives Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are to blame, but the thing is the shampoo has them too, so maybe not and the waxiness or whatever (co-washing in general) causes this?\n\nI'm pretty certain that the conditioner causes this. I didn't use any other product. When I wash with just shampoo from the same brand (it's SLES based, but it's the opposite of potent, I take few times more of it to achieve the same potency that normal SLS shampoos have, could be the conditioner is similarly \"potent\") and either don't use any other product or only few drops of oil it won't be like this and it's pretty much what I want.\n\nThe ingredients of the conditioner:\n> Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Inula Helenium Extract, Humulus Lupulus Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Cera Alba, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Chamomilla Recutita Oil, Geranium Sibiricum Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-12 Dimethicon, Pinus Sibirica Needle Extract, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Ceteareth-20, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nNote that Cera Alba (Bees wax), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (guar gum derivative) and PEG-12 Dimethicon (water-soluble sillicon) are in it. Could it be that the Bees wax is the problem? The two other ingredients are water soluble so shouldn't be... Cera Alba (Bees wax) is also in the shampoo, but probably in smaller quantity.\n\nIngredients of the shampoo:\n> Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract*, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Glycine Soja Oil, Urtica Dioica Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Water*, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract*, Salvia Officnalis Oil, Carum Carvi Fruit Oil, Mel*, Saponaria Officinalis Root Extract*, Cera Alba, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nShould I buy another conditioner, keep on using this one or switch to non-harsh shampoo? If I should switch conditioner, what ingredients should I be looking for except no wax and sillicon? No oils? Other surfactants (glucosides instead of kationic chlorides)? Something more oily? Something very minimalistic (just kationic surfactans like cetrimonium chloride and humectants like cetearyl alcohol)? Something with more humectants?  I wouldn't be super happy buying another conditioner just to find out it's trash and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nEdit: My hair is ~5inch/13cm long.",

        "body": "I'm no expert and this is just personal experience over the past several years but I would try an SLS-free shampoo & silicon-/wax-free conditioner to see if that helps. It sounds more like an issue with the conditioner ingredients or other products sticking to your hair and scalp then not getting washed out with the co-wash so it builds up on your hair more and more. I tried many conditioners to co-wash and also water-only but neither worked for me. My hair ended up stringy, heavy and waxy though not as quickly as you have experienced. I have very hard water where I live which can also add to the problem.  You can also look into an apple cider vinegar rinse as an alternative (lots of info on the side-bar).\n\nI have had good success with SLS-free shampoo plus silicon-free conditioner every second wash or so. I only have to wash it once a week with water-only rinses as needed in between washes and my scalp is much less itchy and dry than when I was using regular shampoo or co-washing. When particularly dry and itchy, I use jojoba oil on my scalp as a mask/cleanse before I shower, massage it in well, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash out . This also helps with any build-up of product on my scalp.\n\nIt will probably take some trial and error to find out what works for you and a bit of time for your scalp to transition. You may also need to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build-up on your hair before starting over to give you a clean start but not everyone needs that step.",

Yes, that one. The infamous burn that caucasian women loved.\n\nAs background, I‚Äôve done retinoids and acids. The whole nine yards, so to speak. One remains untested for me: phenol. Phenol is the star ingredient of BR p50 1970. Otherwise known as Carbolic acid, this has been banned in EU but not in the US. I‚Äôve done some preliminary research on phenol including limited anecdotal ones and women swear by its burning feeling.\n\nSo here goes...\n\nI used it this evening in tandem with Mizon AHA and BHA daily clean toner to prep my skin‚Äôs pH.\n\n**Appearance:** clear toner-like liquid\n\n**Smell:** the infamous smell! Some described the smell as vinegary/vinaigrette. In my experience it was more sulfuric. Like burnt glue-sulfur. Like Satan‚Äôs butth\\*le I imagine. It is preeetty strong bothersome smell. And oh boy does it linger...\n\n**Performance:** there‚Äôs a reason why this is part 1. We will see the results as time goes by. For now it acts very much like your AHAs.\n\n**Effect:** same as above. It does leave a very very slight subtle tackiness... like your AHAs. It did leave that infamous burning feeling though but for a short time only and mostly on my forehead.\n\nApplication is different. It is highly advised to pat/dab the cotton with the BR than rubbing it across your face. Application starts from the d√©colletage, neck, and then face. Working upwards. Don‚Äôt go on the same area twice as well. And then one light swipe across the lips.\n\nIt is worth noting that after swiping it *ONCE* across the lips, my lips went slightly numb when I smacked them together. I was not sure if I was going to panic or not (haha), thankfully the feeling went away after a couple of minutes.\n\nAs for the ingredients, the BR P50 1970 has the listed as follows:\n\n*Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Phenol, Niacinamide, Vinegar (Acetum), Ethoxydiglycol, Magnesium Chloride, Lactic acid, Arctium lappa root extract, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sulfur.*\n\nThe bottle I purchased was the smallest size for sampling purposes  (1.7 fl.oz.)

    "body": "Burdock root (Arctium lappa L. root) is an edible plant that has been used for centuries (even millenia) in various cultures for its medicinal properties. It is a rich source of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds that have been associated with numerous health benefits, including neuroprotection, glucose regulation, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, and anti-depression effects. This article will delve into the potential benefits of burdock root, particularly for individuals living with glaucoma. (It also touches on how burdock complements the role of magnesium in health.)\n\n> \"[Burdock] is widely distributed throughout Northern Asia, Europe, and North America and has been utilized for hundreds of years. The roots, fruits, seeds, and leaves of [Burdock] have been extensively used in traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). [Burdock] has attracted a great deal of attention due to its possession of highly recognized bioactive metabolites with significant therapeutic potential. Numerous pharmacological effects have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo by [Burdock] and its bioactive metabolites, including:\n>\n> - antimicrobial\n> - [antiobesity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36183168/)\n> - antioxidant\n> - anticancer\n> - anti-inflammatory\n> - anti-diabetic\n> - anti-allergic\n> - antiviral\n> - gastro-protective\n> - hepatoprotective (liver protective)\n> - neuroprotective. \n>\n> Additionally, [Burdock] has demonstrated considerable clinical efficacies and valuable applications in nanomedicine.\" ([Yosri et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2022.114104))\n\n## Burdock Root: A Promising Neuroprotective Agent\n\nBurdock root has been identified as a promising neuroprotective agent [\\(PubMed\\)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24956398/). Arctigenin, an active ingredient of burdock root, has been found to exert neuroprotective, anti-decrepitude, and anti-inflammatory activities in another study. \n\nRegular consumption of burdock root extracts (a source of arctigenin) produced antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects [\\(PubMed\\)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34439529/). Moreover, a study found that burdock root ameliorates cerebral ischemia by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and suppressing AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy [\\(PubMed\\)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33691269/). These neuroprotective effects could be particularly beneficial for individuals with glaucoma (which, as we know, is characterized by progressive optic nerve damage).\n\n## Burdock Root and Magnesium: A Natural Synergy\n\nBurdock root is a natural source of magnesium, a mineral that plays a crucial role in numerous bodily functions (including over 600 enzymatic reactions). Furthermore, **burdock root enhances magnesium absorption**, making it a potentially attractive food ingredient to combine with supplemental magnesium.\n\nMagnesium is also useful in maintaining healthy blood glucose levels, supporting bone health, and exerting anti-anxiety and anti-depression effects. \n\nBurdock root is rich in magnesium. One cup (approximately 118 grams) of raw burdock root contains about 44.8 milligrams of magnesium, which is 11 percent of the daily value (DV).\n\n#### Magnesium and Glaucoma\n\nIncreasing magnesium intake could be beneficial in the management of glaucoma. A study found that magnesium plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and treatment of glaucoma. Therefore, the consumption of burdock root, which is a natural source of magnesium, could be interesting for individuals living with glaucoma. See these related posts for more on magnesium and glaucoma:\n\n- [The Influence Of Magnesium On Visual Field And Peripheral Vasospasm In Glaucoma : AskGlaucoma](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGlaucoma/comments/148czch/the_influence_of_magnesium_on_visual_field_and/)\n\n- [Does Magnesium Improve Patients with Open Angle Glaucoma? (Yes, according to study) : AskGlaucoma](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGlaucoma/comments/148cb9g/does_magnesium_improve_patients_with_open_angle/)\n\n### Glucose Regulation\n\nA review study suggested that burdock root contributes to the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus by regulating glucose homeostasis and improving oxidative stress [\\(PubMed\\)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31232489/). Burdock root also contains inulin, a soluble and prebiotic fiber that further helps improve digestion and lower blood sugar. Therefore, burdock root enhances and complements magnesium's role in maintaining healthy blood glucose levels.\n\n### Bone Health\n\nBurdock root has been reported to be beneficial for bones, particularly osteoarthritis. A study found that Burdock root tea improves inflammatory status and oxidative stress in patients with knee osteoarthritis [\\(PubMed\\)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25350500/). Another study suggested that burdock root extract enhances chondrogenesis (the development of cartilage) in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Burdock root also complements magnesium's role in bone health.\n\n### Anti-Anxiety and Anti-Depression Effects\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a study focused on the burdock constituent arctigenin found that it produces anti-depressant and anti-anxiety effects. Another study found that 1,3-Dicaffeoylquinic Acid, another active compound of burdock root, ameliorates depressive-like behavior by regulating hippocampal nitric oxide synthesis. Therefore, burdock root complements magnesium's anti-anxiety and anti-depression effects nicely.\n\n## Other Health Benefits of Burdock Root\n\nBurdock root is an effective anti-inflammatory agent traditionally used for respiratory infections like influenza and other infections. It also has antioxidants and antidiabetic compounds. In terms of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the active ingredients in the root are said to \"detoxify\" blood, promote blood circulation to the skin surface, improve skin quality/texture, and cure skin diseases like eczema.\n\nThe following study mentions that burdock root improved short-term memory:\n\n> ‚ÄúRecently, a number of pharmacological studies have indicated that Arctium lappa displayed anti-inflammatory (de Almeida et al., 2013), hepatoprotective (Lin et al., 2002) and free radical scavenging properties (Predes et al., 2011). Previous studies have identified many phenolic compounds in the root of burdock including chlorogenic acid, arctigenin and caffeoylquinic acid derivatives (Liu et al., 2012). The chlorogenic acid significantly reversed cognitive impairments and improved the impairment of short-term memory induced by scopolamine in vivo experiments (Kwon et al., 2010).‚Äù ([Tian et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24956398/))\n\nAn animal study found that burdock root reduced body weight and blood cholesterol levels:\n\n> ‚ÄúConclusions: Aqueous extract of burdock root reduced body weight and cholesterol in rats, possibly by modulating the differential expression of genes.‚Äù ([Bo et al., 2018, p. 158](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28758851/))\n\n## Safety and Interactions\n\nBurdock root is generally safe for consumption. However, people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae plant families, which include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, and daisies, could possibly experience an allergic reaction to using burdock. There are no known scientific reports of interactions between burdock and conventional medications.\n\nIn my opinion, burdock root offers a plethora of attractive benefits, particularly for individuals living with glaucoma. Its neuroprotective, glucose-regulating, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, and anti-depression properties, along with its ability to **enhance magnesium absorption**, make it incredibly interesting to me. However, as with any supplement or dietary change, it's always recommended to consult with a qualified healthcare provider to get advice that takes into account your personal health status.\n\n## References\n\nSee [Burdock Root's Potential Relevance for Those of Us Living with Glaucoma: Neuroprotection, Glucose Regulation, Anti-Inflammatory, Anti-Anxiety, Anti-Depression and More | Ask FitEyes](https://ask.fiteyes.com/p/91127/)",

Have never ever had acne/spots problems in my life, if anything I was lucky as I have never been the most dedicated to my skincare routine but have never suffered from spots!\n\n2.5 years ago I had a Mirena IUS inserted. Due to migraines I cannot take the combined pill. I had tried the mini pill but found my periods just never ever ever stopped. Initially I loved the IUS, didn't seem to have any problems with it, it settled quickly and although my periods are a bit all over the place they are very light so do not really bother me. \n\nAbout 18 months ago I started noticing red spots over my back and shoulders which I largely ignored. It was not too bad and I am a confident person so I just got on with things without letting it bother me. However in the last 10 months it has reached a point that I can not ignore. My entire back is covered and more recently my chest and shoulders have broken out terribly. At the moment I reckon I have 50-100 little red spots on each shoulder and my chest literally looks polka dotted. Some white heads but mainly just red bumps. \n\nThe complete list of things I have tried:\n\nJust generally better washing! \n\nNeutrogena Body Clear body wash - which I have to buy from US as they don't sell it in the UK, I initially thought this was great but it doesn't seem to do anything now\n\nMurad clarifying body spray\n\nGarnier Pure A spot fighting moisturiser \n\nDoc prescribed Tetrasomthing (Can't remember the name) but it gave me such horrendous vision disturbances I thought I was going blind so switched to...\n\nErythromycin but once again the side effects took too much of a toll\n\nAm currently taking Burdock root extract which goes against all my beliefs as a scientist but I am truly running out of ideas \n\n\nWith all of these things there is little to no change to my skin. I am a healthy person who drinks more than enough water and eats well. I am starting to think, after reading around, my IUS may be causing the problems. I would be reluctant to take it out but I may consider switching to the copper IUD with no hormones as my skin is really stressing me out at the moment. \n\nAny experiences or advice on anything would be really appreciated! \n\nEDIT: remembered the first antibiotic name Lymecycline ",

The active moist is very light and leaves my skin slightly tacky once it dries -- I wouldn't say it's very \"plumping\")\n\nThank you for all your advice and information thus far!! <3 I'm excited to take my first plunge into true skin care :) \n\n\nEDIT: Oh! I should mention I have an oily/normal skin with hormonal acne, slightly enlarged pores in my oily areas, and PIE/PIH on my cheeks. I'm still in the beginning stages of figuring out what to do about all of this, haha. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nAnd finally, I thought I would include an ingredient list for anyone who's interested:\n\nCleansing Gel: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\nActive Moist:\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Methyl Gluceth-20, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Lactamide MEA, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Hedera Helix (Ivy) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Sambucus Nigra Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Parietaria Officinalis Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Leaf/Root Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Glycolipids, Sodium Hyaluronate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Palmitoyl, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Amylopectin/Glycerin Crosspolymer, Lecithin, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Allantoin, Panthenol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-10, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 60, Aminomethyl Propanol, Disodium EDTA, Linalool, Lavandula Hybrida Oil.",

The two products I think are Dermalogica's best, would be the Daily Microfoliant (DM) and their Pre-Cleanse (PC).  The DM has done more to smooth out my skin than any acid has EVER done.  As far as the PC goes, I really happen to enjoy the consistency and how long it lasts.  It's also very effective and runs over the face well.",

I will give it credit for not breaking me out, so at least it did no harm :)    It's just an ok moisturizer.

It‚Äôs best to ease yourself into retinol products if you‚Äôre new and to be honest I‚Äôve started using low percentages more frequently (3-4 nights a week) rather than using a stronger product twice a week.\n\nMy personal opinion is sometimes in formulas ‚Äòless is more‚Äô so I actually think without using either products the retinol reform looks a better product.

My skin is usually rather sensitive (it reacts to 2 of 3 products I try on my face and then burns and turns red instantly - has reacted to quite a few Kiehl's products and the Ordinary's niacinimide). I went for an appointment with my beautician yesterday and my skin appears to be more sensitive than usual, it reacted to 2 products she tried to use to calm my skin and decided to use an ampoule in the end (not sure what it is exactly but it stopped the heat/burn and calmed the redness a little). \n\nI took a shower earlier and washed my face twice (because I forgot I washed it already... stupid I know), and after my shower I usually apply a toner, serum, then moisturise. I skipped the serum because my face seemed to be reacting to the usual toner I used, and then reacted more to my moisturiser. I've used these products for over a year and it's the first time my skin has reacted to them  so I'm a little shocked. Washed them off then settled for another moisturiser from my beautician's place.\n\nSkin type: combination skin (more dry on my cheeks), prone to breakouts especially when I have my period or am stressed\n\nAM Routine:   \nCleanser - Kiehl's Calendula Deep Foaming Face Wash  \nToner - cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad\n\n(I know I should be using sunscreen, but I breakout easily and am reluctant to cake too much stuff on my face. Some recommendations for light sunscreen I've seen online aren't available here in Singapore so I still haven't found a solution yet.)\n\nPM Routine:  \nCleanser - Kiehl's Calendula Deep Foaming Face Wash  \nToner - cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad  \nSerum - Simple Logic Regenerating Serum (this is bought from my beautician's place, a google search would tell you where it is because they seem to be the ONLY PLACE in the whole world using this brand??? If anyone else has heard of it please please tell me cause I'm weirded out by how there's literally no other trace of this supposedly German brand on the Internet. Ingredient list: Purified Water, Glycerin Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum Fruit Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Polysorbate 20, Sclerotium Gum Diazolidinyl Urea, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Methylparaben, Propylparaben)  \nMoisturiser - cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence  \nMoisturiser #2 if my skin is feeling really dry - cosrx Advanced Snail 92 All in one Cream (I've stuck to snail mucin because I thought my skin would never react since it's essentially mostly water but apparently not because my skin seemed to hate it earlier)\n\nThe moisturiser I used just now that my skin didn't react to: Skin-Logical Hydro Repair (another mystery brand from my beautician's place, Ingredients: Water, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin, Fragrance, Aloe Barbadensis leaf juice, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbonate.)\n\nI have literally no memory of changing anything in my diet or skincare routine and the sudden ramp up in sensitivity is making me a little unsettled. I'm scared of trying out new products because my skin reacts to most, I've tried spot testing before but I have eczema on my elbows and the product didn't react until I put it on my face) so any recommendations or advice on how to improve my routine and calm the redness and somehow tune down sensitivity would be extremely helpful!!\n\n(reposted because I had to check how to add the tag - sorry!)",

    "body": "Hi yall, this is my first post in this sub (should have tagged this \"routine help\" also oops) and I'm seeking a bit of advice on whether or not these new routine changes seem to be working. Please shout out if I'm making any sort of glaring mistakes. I'm 27 and have dry, acne prone skin that seems to have started settling down more in the last few months, so I wanted to focus on improving my skin texture, minimize scarring, and add radiance to my dull face. Fast forward to me adding some new products to help with this and now my acne has worsened a bit.\n\nI started slowly introducing TO Lactic Acid 10% and Glycolic Acid Toner on Jan 5th. Started with once a week and have now bumped it up to between 3 and 4, plus the TO AHA/BHA mask only once a week. I haven't had any adverse reactions to these that I can tell and my moisture barrier seems intact? I also started using these Disciple Good Skin and Dreamy Skin oils at the same time for a thicker moisturizer bc winter. I'm worried that these are more comedogenic because of the essential oils in them and olive oil is listed on the ingredients (I've included the full ingredient list in my routine breakdown per the Disciple website). I think my skin has purged a bit from adding acid exfoliation since the acne comes to a head quicker and it's located in my typical break out areas. But I have noticed that any spots that have come to the surface now are quite deep and leave these darker red marks after scabbing over.  (I've been very good at not popping them, but sometimes the whiteheads come open when I'm in the shower or washing my face.) I also get random red spots (closed comedones?) that seem like they'll surface into pimples but then they either just sit there without forming heads or if I'm lucky, they disappear. This usually happens on my cheeks, forehead, and chin and they sometimes come in little clusters. I've also been using a new spot treatment called Pickel-Break for the past week but haven't noticed it reducing pimple size or really doing much of anything. My chin has always been my major acne problem area, so are these old dirty pores getting all the gunk out or am I just clogging them more? Any routine recommendations or other product ideas to help with these issues would be much appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoutine Breakdown:\n\n\\-Old routine was with the same cleansers before the I added The Ordinary acids.\n\n\\-Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream was my main moisturizer for day and night before the I added the Disciple products.\n\n\\-Differin Gel was my PM active occasionally in my old routine \\~3x week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAM:\n\nAlex Steinherr Micellar Cleansing Gel\n\nKiehl's Powerful Strength Line Reducing 12.5% Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nDisciple Good Skin Oil (*Ingredients: Cucumber seed oil, Turmeric oil\\*, Rosemary oil, Geranium oil\\*,* *Ashwagandha root oil\\*, Lavender oil, Tea tree oil, Burdock root extract\\*\\*, Extra virgin olive oil.)*¬†\n\nSoltan Kids 50+ SPF\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPM:\n\nAlex Steinherr Low pH Cleanser w Salicylic Acid\n\nThe Ordinary Glycolic Acid Toner \\*Twice a week as only active acid\n\n\\-**OR**\\-\n\nThe Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + Hyaluronic Acid \\*Twice a week as only active acid when not using GA Toner\n\nDisciple Dreamy Skin Oil (*Ingredients:* *Rosehip seed oil (Rosa Mosqueta), Watermelon seed oil, Retinyl palmitate, Blue chamomile oil\\*, Frankincense oil\\*, Jojoba oil,* *Ashwagandha root oil\\*, Jasmine oil, Burdock root extract\\*\\*, Extra virgin olive oil.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes:\n\nDifferin Gel \\*when not using Kiehl's Vit C during AM routine if my skin is being extra problematic (I haven't used this at all this month with the new products)\n\nDr Jart Ceramidin Cream or The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid when I don't want to feel oilier during the day, I also add these before my night oil if I'm feeling extra dry\n\nThe Ordinary AHA/BHA Mask \\*once per week\n\nPickel Break Acne Spot Treatment on active acne when needed (ALCHOL DENAT., MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA LEAF OIL, LEMONENE, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, CITRUS AURANTIUM DULCIS PEEL OIL, AROMA, PANTHENOL, AQUA, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA ROOT EXTRACT, USNA BARBATA EXTRACT, BENZYL BENZOATE, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRAL, GERANIOL, LINALOOL.)\n\n[sorry for the bad lighting in the bottom left photo](https://preview.redd.it/z8c5r9k54ld21.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3cc41624ace70532acc3d5ef2d3a31bb6d3db20)",

With claims of improving liver health and overall well-being, Liv Pure has captured significant attention. As medical professionals, we aim to provide a thorough analysis of Liv Pure, evaluating its components, efficacy, and potential benefits based on current scientific research.\n\n# What is Liv Pure?\n\nLiv Pure is marketed as a dietary supplement designed to support liver health and promote overall vitality. Its formulation is intended to enhance liver function, detoxify the body, and support metabolic processes. The supplement combines a blend of natural ingredients, each purported to contribute to liver health and well-being.\n\n# Key Ingredients of Liv Pure\n\nUnderstanding the efficacy of Liv Pure requires a closer look at its ingredients. Each component is selected for its potential health benefits:\n\n* **Milk Thistle Extract**: Known for its active compound, silymarin, milk thistle is widely recognized for its liver-protective properties. Research indicates that silymarin can help regenerate liver cells and protect against liver damage caused by toxins and diseases.\n* **Artichoke Leaf Extract**: Artichoke is believed to support liver health by promoting bile production and aiding digestion. It contains compounds that may help protect the liver from damage and improve overall liver function.\n* **Turmeric Root Extract**: Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These effects are beneficial for reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver.\n* **Dandelion Root Extract**: Traditionally used to support liver health, dandelion root may help improve bile flow and support liver detoxification processes.\n* **Burdock Root Extract**: Known for its potential to detoxify the body, burdock root may help remove toxins from the liver and improve overall liver function.\n\n# Scientific Insights into Liv Pure's Ingredients\n\n# Milk Thistle and Liver Health\n\nMilk thistle's active compound, silymarin, is well-studied for its liver-protective effects. Research has demonstrated its potential to:\n\n* **Regenerate Liver Cells**: Silymarin promotes the regeneration of liver cells, which is crucial for recovering from liver damage.\n* **Protect Against Toxins**: Silymarin acts as an antioxidant, neutralizing harmful free radicals that can cause oxidative stress and damage liver cells.\n* **Support Liver Function**: Studies have shown that silymarin can enhance liver function and reduce symptoms associated with liver disorders.\n\n[Scientists Discover A Hidden Root Cause Of Stubborn Belly Fat, And It Will Surprise You‚Ä¶](https://studentdairy.life/sarlivpure)\n\n# Artichoke Leaf Extract and Digestive Health\n\nArtichoke leaf extract is known for its beneficial effects on digestion and liver health. Key benefits include:\n\n* **Promoting Bile Production**: Artichoke leaf extract stimulates bile production, which is essential for digesting fats and removing toxins from the liver.\n* **Supporting Liver Detoxification**: The extract helps in the detoxification process by enhancing the liver's ability to process and eliminate toxins.\n* **Protecting Liver Cells**: Antioxidants in artichoke leaf extract protect liver cells from damage caused by oxidative stress.\n\n# Turmeric Root Extract and Inflammation\n\nTurmeric, particularly its active compound curcumin, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Research highlights include:\n\n* **Reducing Inflammation**: Curcumin can help reduce inflammation in the liver, which is beneficial for those with inflammatory liver conditions.\n* **Neutralizing Oxidative Stress**: Curcumin acts as an antioxidant, reducing oxidative stress and protecting liver cells from damage.\n* **Supporting Overall Liver Health**: The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects contribute to improved liver function and overall health.\n\n# Dandelion Root Extract and Liver Function\n\nDandelion root has been used traditionally for its liver-supporting properties. Research suggests:\n\n* **Enhancing Bile Flow**: Dandelion root stimulates bile production, which aids in digestion and detoxification.\n* **Supporting Liver Health**: The extract has potential benefits in supporting liver function and reducing symptoms of liver conditions.\n\n# Burdock Root Extract and Detoxification\n\nBurdock root is recognized for its detoxifying effects. Its potential benefits include:\n\n* **Removing Toxins**: Burdock root helps in the elimination of toxins from the liver, supporting overall liver health.\n* **Improving Liver Function**: The extract may enhance liver function by aiding in the removal of waste products and supporting detoxification processes.\n\n# Evaluating the Effectiveness of Liv Pure\n\nThe effectiveness of Liv Pure depends on various factors, including individual health conditions, lifestyle, and adherence to the recommended dosage. While the ingredients have shown potential benefits in supporting liver health, it is essential to consider the following:\n\n# Clinical Evidence and Research\n\nThe scientific evidence supporting Liv Pure's claims is derived from studies on its individual ingredients. However, comprehensive clinical trials specifically evaluating the effectiveness of Liv Pure as a whole are limited. As a result, while the ingredients are promising, more research is needed to confirm the supplement's overall efficacy.\n\n# Dosage and Administration\n\nAdhering to the recommended dosage is crucial for achieving the desired effects. Overuse or improper use of supplements may lead to adverse effects. It is advisable to follow the guidelines provided by the manufacturer and consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.\n\n# Individual Variability\n\nIndividual responses to supplements can vary based on factors such as age, health status, and lifestyle. What works for one person may not necessarily yield the same results for another. Monitoring personal health and consulting with a healthcare provider can help tailor the use of Liv Pure to individual needs.\n\n# Potential Benefits and Considerations\n\n# Benefits\n\n* **Support for Liver Health**: Liv Pure's ingredients are known to support liver health and function, potentially benefiting those with liver concerns.\n* **Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects**: The supplement's components may provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, contributing to overall well-being.\n* **Digestive Support**: Ingredients like artichoke leaf extract and dandelion root may aid in digestion and support liver detoxification processes.\n\n# Considerations\n\n* **Limited Clinical Trials**: While individual ingredients are supported by research, comprehensive clinical trials on Liv Pure as a whole are lacking.\n* **Consultation with Healthcare Professionals**: It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider before starting Liv Pure, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those taking other medications.\n* **Personal Health Factors**: Individual responses to supplements can vary, and monitoring personal health is crucial for assessing effectiveness.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nLiv Pure offers a blend of natural ingredients with potential benefits for liver health and overall well-being. While the individual components are supported by scientific research, more comprehensive studies are needed to validate the supplement's overall efficacy. As with any supplement, it is essential to consider personal health factors, adhere to recommended dosages, and consult with healthcare professionals for personalized advice.\n\nFor those seeking to enhance liver function and support overall health, Liv Pure may be a valuable addition to a well-rounded health regimen. As research continues to evolve, staying informed and making evidence-based decisions will ensure the best outcomes for health and wellness.\n\n[Scientists Discover A Hidden Root Cause Of Stubborn Belly Fat, And It Will Surprise You‚Ä¶](https://studentdairy.life/sarlivpure)",

Paula's Choice has samples you can buy of both her 2% BHA liquid and 8% AHA gel. you wanna ease into it first by using the BHA one day then the AHA the other day, but some people can do BHA in the morning and AHA at night. make sure to use a sunscreen during the day as well bc the AHA makes your skin photosensitive. the AHA will slough off the layers of skin on the closed comedones and the BHA will penetrate them. If that doesnt work, you can go to the derm for a retinoid which will help the closed comedones and blackheads also.",

    "body": "hey guys,\n\na friend of mine offers mesotherapy and has the proper equipment/mesogun to inject the serum right unter the scalp.\n\nhe's using the hair growth booster from \"dermida\", however, he encouraged me to do my own research on what serum is known to be best looking at the ingredients.\n\ni know that other solutions apart from fin/dut/min are generally seen as nothing more than snake oil here, but as he'd offer me the \"treatment\" for free and i'd only have to pay for the serum, i think it's worth a try, especially in the first months after my HT, even if it's just a 10% boost.\n\nso my question is to anyone who has more knowledge about the individual ingredients and their effectiveness than i do. as i don't want to link any specific products here, i thought just listing the ingredients that are listed on the product pages would be fine.\n\nso here you go:\n\ndermida: Biotin, Pyridoxne HCL and Thiamine HCL / essential ingredients: Vitamin B1, B5, B6 and B7. 20‚Ç¨/$ per 10ml\n\nskinderma: Panthenol, Biotin, Methylsilanol Mannuronate, hydrolyzed Collagen, and Glutathione 10‚Ç¨/$ per 10ml\n\ntoskani: Panthenol, Sabal Serrulata, Troxerutine, Glutathione, Biotin, Taurine, Ferrous Gluconate, Pyridoxine, Thiamine 25‚Ç¨/$ per 10ml\n\ndr. balwi mesotherapy: 10‚Ç¨/$ per 10ml essential ingredients: procapil, anagain, phytocelltec (plant-based stem cells). detailed: Aqua, Panthenol, Glycerin, Polysorbate-20, Propylene Glycol, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juƒ±ce, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Biotin, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Niacin, Calcium Pantothenate, Humulus Lupulus Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Lawsonƒ±a Inermis Extract, Panicum Miliaceum Seed Extract, Betula Alba Leaf Extract, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis Leaf Extract, Echinacea Purpurea Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana Leaf Extract, Tilia Cordata Flower Extract, Beta-Glucan, Maltodextrin, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Pisum Sativum Seed Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Lecithin, Xanthan Gum, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, PCA, Glycine, Alanine, Serine, Valine, Proline, Threonine, Isoleucine, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Hyaluronic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium DNA, Potassium Chloride, Potassium Glutathione Isomerized Linoleate, Butylene Glycol, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract, Parfum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nThe last one is from the online store of Elithair, the well-known \"Hair Mill\" in Istanbul. That's why I'm most skeptical about this product, even though it's the cheapest and has the most ingredients ‚Äì though that doesn't necessarily mean anything. But since all the other products in the shop, like dermarollers, etc., are outrageously overpriced, I would be surprised if this particular product was actually worth its price. On the other hand, the other manufacturers are probably making huge margins on their products as well, that's for sure.",

I do not have any \"particular issue\" besides a bit of acne, but not even that much.\n\nThat said, along with my cleanser, sunscreen and moisturizer, I wanted to introduce an exfoliating toner (possibly with AHA or BHA) to smooth out my complexion. I've been using for a few months an (Italian) toner which was extremely cheap (around 5 euros) and seemed to have a pretty good inci. These are the ingredients:\n\nAqua [Water], Aloe barbadensis leaf juice (*), Betaine, Zinc PCA, Glycolic acid, Betula alba leaf extract, Arctium lappa root extract, Hydrolyzed olive fruit (*), Sodium hyaluronate, Hedera helix (Ivy) leaf/stem extract, Lactic acid, Panthenol, Citric acid, Urea, Malic acid, Allantoin, Tartaric acid, Sodium PCA, Hydrolyzed wheat protein, Lysine, Sorbitol, Glycerin, Sodium gluconate, Parfum [Fragrance], Polysorbate 20, Trideceth-9, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citronellol, Geraniol, Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, CI 42090 [Blue 1]. GLUCONATE, LEVULINIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE.\n\n\n\nNow, the point is: I, out of curiosity, tried to measure the pH level of the aforementioned toner using a litmus test and it apparently has a pH of around 5. Can the toner even actually exfoliate this way?",

A bit of research on the webz would explain most of them and what the benefits are though. Once i get to stuff I can't pronounce I stop reading and put it back. www.mrbeards.com has some products that are awesome. They cost more than $4 but you can pronounce everything on the label and they smell fantastic.",
