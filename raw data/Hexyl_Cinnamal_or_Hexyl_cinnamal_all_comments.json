    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products.

I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether.

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it. But if you’re ok with it then it’s a super good serum for like 1/4 the cost of ANR.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol.

I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation.

I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh.

I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

        "body": "I am probably gonna get downvoted to hell for this, but Biotique Neem Margosa Shampoo is the only one that seems to work on my hair. All my life, I used sulphate shampoos.. Tried all of them out there, from cheapest to most expensive, but none worked for my hair. Cut to Biotique, and my hair got so smooth and shiny. Hairfall reduced tremendously. Hair growth got better, less split ends. Then I recently switched to other sulphate free shampoos, and no matter how less or more I apply, my hair looks so dead and dull. So, I don't care if Biotique is sulphate or sulphate free. I just know its gentle, and even if I use more, it never harms me. It always repairs my hair beyond my expectation (I suffer from depression so I can go for long periods without taking care of my hair) and makes them silky smooth and in no need of any extra treatment. Its magic for me.",

The only duds I've found are the ones from Biotique, Patanjali and Himalaya shampoos as they don't have a silky smooth lather and they feel harsh. I am using the L'Oréal Total Repair 5 and I have no complaints. \n\nThe most important thing in my opinion is the conditioner. Even then it's more about letting the conditioner sit and work for a few minutes that makes a lot of difference. I have tried Pantene, Sunsilk, TRESemmé and Garnier Ultra Blends conditioners and the Pantene works really well for my fine hair. I have struggled with frizzy hair for a long time and I've tried to fix it with serums and creams but nothing works as well like conditioners do.",

It's impossible to last without sulphates. Most CG shampoos also have milder sulphates because they're cleansing agents. Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.

Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

When you use a full product line/hair care system consistently you will get far better results than if you neglect to use part of that system. The products are meant to compliment each other.\n\n3. Using a different shampoo and conditioner could counteract the results of the olaplex treatment. Let’s say there’s an ingredient in a shampoo that doesn’t “mix” well with the bonding treatment, but you wouldn’t know until after you use it a few times(and the change could be mistaken for thinking the olaplex treatment is wearing off it wasn’t worth it, etc. when the shampoo is the actual culprit).\n\n4. If you get an olaplex treatment, but do not use the shampoo and conditioner...it’ll be okay, but it will be much better if you do use it.\n\n5.

Only experience will tell how it works in your hair\"\n\n\"That particular silicone is designed to attach to damaged areas in your hair - little chipped cuticle edges, broken cuticles. It doesn't prevent moisture from entering the hair strands. It acts like a conditioning ingredient. It will wash out with almost any detergent. The only detergent that does not remove it very well is Decyl glucoside or Lauryl glucoside - and that only applies when one of those is the *only* detergent in a shampoo\"\n\n-Science-y hair blog.\n\nMeaning, in theory you won't be experiencing buildup but also get the silicone effect. This silicone can be washed off with cocoamidopropyl betaine Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Sodium lauroyl glutamate, Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate all of these can wash out the silicone and all of these are cg approved. \n\nSo, in theory and from a logical point of view, this could be a budget friendly conditioner suitable for curly hair! \n\nAlso if you've used this conditioner please share your experience!",

I started experimenting with combination of products over the last year and realised my hair needs medium level of conditioning and protein makes it very dry. So I stick to a normal routine of washing my hair with SebaMed Anti-dry shampoo(prescribed by my derm) and WOW Morrocan Argan Oil Conditioner. I use a few drops of Nature's Tattva Sweet Almond oil as my leave in and WOW aloe vera gel. This seemed to work for my hair but I still wasn't happy with my hair. \n\nSaw your post and thought of giving the pantene conditioner, Silky Smooth variant in Advanced haircare series a try. And OMG, IT IS CGM FRIENDLY. Still waited a month to be able to judge the conditioner and it works wonders without breaking the pocket. It doesn't have as much slip as a heavy condioner would have though, maybe the damage protection variant might, so I don't recommend it for extremely dry hair. I mainly use it to detangle and am planning to dilute it to use as a leave-in as well.",

    "body": "You want to know if it worked...I'm burying the lede here. Stay with me though.\n\nI have not had a chance to read the papers K18's team wrote in the last 10 years, so I decided to do this \"part 1\" with current results, then a part 2 with paper/patent comments plus how my hair fared in an upcoming bleaching service.\n\nK18 is a post-wash leave-in treatment applied on towel-dried hair. The claim is \"...molecular breakthrough clinically proven to reverse hair damage in 4 minutes\" from bleach, dyeing, heat, other chemical services like perms.\n\nAnd\n\n>Traveling into the inner-most layers of hair to reach the core polypeptide chains (keratin chains), our revolutionary K18Peptide™ is just the right size and makeup to fit in and reconnect broken chains.\n\nIngredients as of this writing:\n\nWater, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polysorbate 20, sh-Oligopeptide-78 (K18Peptide™), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Isopropyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Geraniol, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nIt is sold in 5 ml sample sizes or 50 ml full size. The pump pushes out about 1ml of product and anywhere from 1 to 4+ pumps is needed for the treatment depending on hair length, volume, & strand thickness. The lotion goes over clean but not conditioned towel-dried hair. Once applied, it needs to sit on hair for 4 minutes before using any other product.\n\nThe instructions are to use every time you wash your hair for 4 to 6 washes. If using a lot of product (no explanation on how 'heavy product use' is defined), the website text recommends a clarifying shampoo before application. After the initial 4-6 applications, the rate is 1 application every 3 to 4 washes.\n\nPros (and DOES IT WORK?):\n\nK18 improved the look and feel of my bleached hair ends, and the hair ends curled with no coaxing needed and felt soft/shiny again. The time my hair takes to dry without products shortened by 1.5 hours. Frizz diminished. Squishing my hair after washing produced less water. And I got to day 4 curly hair, which had not happened to me, ever.\n\nI saw significant change after application #4. I had committed to doing 6 washes/applications, so I continued. Areas of my hair that had been bleached more than the rest showed improvement last.\n\nLike Olaplex, K18 does something good, but I cannot state that it does what it claims (insert peptide chain in cortex, have peptide chain chemically link up bits and pieces in cortex). I did not test elasticity.\n\nK18 significantly improved hydrophobicity. Based on the list of ingredients I bet there is heavy adsorbtion of cationics going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess pro, but not cons:\n\n1. The amount to apply is tiny, and spreading it throughout the hair is challenging because one cannot see where product has been applied versus where it has not, plus the product is all over your palms, so cannot feel, either. For my hair I needed 4-5 pumps (4-5 ml), so I applied in sections, ends first, and hoped for the best.\n2. For people whose curly hair routine includes putting styling products in sopping wet hair, or not touching curls, using K18 requires rethinking all that as it is applied on clean towel dried hair, and must  be applied before any other hair product.\n3. If you co-wash, I would suggest using a shampoo that does not deposit much of anything on the hair prior to using K18\n4. The dosing chart is hidden on the product page (you must select the accordion chevron--the arrow pointing down-- to the right of \"how to use\"  to see the text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssorted: If buying the 50 ml product in the US, your cost is $1.50/pump. The 5 ml sample cost is $2.40/pump. Also, their customer service answered my questions pretty fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill I buy again? \n\nEDITED 5 /8 / 2022: Link to Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18\\_my\\_experience\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18_my_experience_part_2/)",

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

I should also mention that I have normal/dry in winter skin, so I tend to need heavier moisture and occlusives.\n\nIf you have oily or combo skin, La Neige may provide the moisture you're looking for!

If you have colored hair (highlights, single process, etc) DO NOT USE THIS. All the money you paid your stylist will go down the drain, as shampoos like this have pH levels way beyond the natural pH of our hair and skin, which can cause more harm than good.

The texture is fantastic. The fragrance isn't off-putting either. A very good moisturizer but the only con is, it doesn't nourish my skin just hydrates if ykwim? It gets absorbed fast and my skin feels dry after it does. I think I would prefer this for intense summer like June? But yes I do use this when I have to write after moisturizing so that the pen doesn't slip and this is nice if I want hydration but isn't good for intense moisturization. Overall I love it but the moisturization is meh but the hydration is 😍😍.  Would I repurchase it? Absolutely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Product name*: **Dove Cooling Gel Crème (Cream)** \n\n*Price :* Starts from around Rs 180(?), usually on sale easily available in nykaa, pharmacies and normal departmental stores. \n\n*Ingredient List:* Water, Glycerin, Dimethicone O, Isopropyl Palmitate, Petrolatum, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil , Carbomer, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide , Benzophenone-4 Disodium EDTA Menthol, FragranceCitral, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool, Ci 42090\n\n*Experience and opinion: Okay I will come out and say it, this is a little better than the ponds one just for body moisturizer, well ofc it's made for moisturization but ykwim? In my condition, this works well. Does exactly what it claims, cools. Feels nice on the skin, good fragrance, great texture, and good hydration. I won't say intense moisturization but it's great IMO and doesn't make me sweat so IDK what's better hehe. It is really good if you want a nice summer moisturizer that makes your skin soft and doesn't feel chip chip and hydrates.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Comparison***: both of them are really good moisturizers and have their plus points but I like the dove one more for body moisturization. The ponds one isn't as long-lasting as the dove either. Overall verdict, the dove is better than ponds for moisturization, maybe because it is a cream, not a gel but if you have a condition like me you will prefer this more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay I know this can be an unnecessary post but I wanted to really post this comparison IDK why and yeah here it is, please be nice omg and don't call me out and say IDK anything coz I'm actually anxious about that happening haha xD okay lol, enough Rona. \n\nHope this helps anyone who had this doubt \n\nlove you<3",

Currently hot and humid.\n\n**Reviews-**\n\nHello everyone. I have been planning on doing this comparative review for a really long time but was too lazy to write it all. Finally got the mental energy to sit and write it down.\n\nPlease do note that I tested these sunscreens in different seasons. I have used all of them for more than a month, though for some, the use has not been very regular because of the lockdown. Kindly factor that in however you may want to.**The review is strictly based on my personal experience- so ymmv, will differ for different people. Please do take it with a pinch of salt.**\n\n**1. Neutrogena Ultra sheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50**\\- This is the sunscreen I have used the longest amount of time for. Very budget friendly. Provides adequate protection. However earlier when I was not aware of the three finger rule, I would use the same quantity as I would with a moisturiser- it suited me and gave me a matte finish. However, when I began using the required amount, it dried my skin. Every time.  I no longer use it now. The consistency is a like a cream but it blends okay.Also since it is a chemical sunscreen, I have not faced any white cast issue with this.\n\nIngredients-[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Homosalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/homosalate), [Benzophenone-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/benzophenone-3), [Ethylhexyl Salicylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-salicylate), [Octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), [Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), [Silica](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/silica), [Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/styrene-acrylates-copolymer), [Potassium Cetyl Phosphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-cetyl-phosphate), [Beeswax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Caprylyl Methicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-methicone), [Cetyl Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-dimethicone), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Sodium Polyacrylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-polyacrylate), [Behenyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behenyl-alcohol), [Xanthan Gum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xanthan-gum), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Acrylates/​C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c12-22-alkyl-methacrylate-copolymer), [Dimethicone/​PEG-10/​15 Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-peg-10-15-crosspolymer), [Ethylhexyl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-stearate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [BHT](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Chlorhexidine Digluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorhexidine-digluconate), [Ethylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylparaben), [Trideceth-6](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/trideceth-6), [Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diethylhexyl-2-6-naphthalate)\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 650 for 88ml. easily available on e commerce sites like Nykaa, Amazon etc.\n\n**2. Innisfree Daily Mild Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++-** I got this last year during lockdown because this is the only budget friendly Korean sunscreen I knew of then. Really light lotion like texture and sits well on the face without piling. Gives a semi-dewy finish. However felt a little greasy on my face during humid season. Did it protect me adequately? I actually do not know because I wore it outside only a few times. I did not tan but the exposure to sun was not a lot so cannot be sure. Has a nice fragrance but when has that protected us from…anything. It has atleast three sunscreen filters and percentage is mentioned. But I am not sure if they are sufficient? No white cast with this either. I enjoyed using it except for the greasiness (which is not much but can still be felt).\n\n**Ingredients**\\-Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate 3.5%, Ethylhexyl Triazone 3.0%, Methylpropanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine 2.5%, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C20-22 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tromethamine, Fragrance, Carbomer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Fructooligosaccharides, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pullulan, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Tocopherol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, C14-22 Alcohols, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Glucoside, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\n**Price and availability**\\- Rs 700 for 50ml. Usually on discount so can be bought for around Rs 500 too. Can be purchased from Nykaa, Boddess, Amazon etc.\n\n**3. The Blessing Tree Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++-** Currently my HG. I have worn it a lot. Provides adequate protection. Has a lotion like texture but is thicker than the Innisfree one. Provides a demi matte finish. Does not feel greasy to me. Has a weird smell but that’s okay. It does not bother me much. Since it is a hybrid sunscreen, it does give a tiny amount, almost negligible white cast which settles down fast too. **WRP.**\n\n**Ingredients-** Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide Lotion\n\nInactive Ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 249 for 100ml on Amazon.\n\n**4. Lóreal Paris Aqua Essence UV Perfect Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++-**  Can't speak enough about its amazing consistency and texture. So light and absorbs easily. Haven’t had the opportunity to wear it often since I bought it this year. The first time I wore it, it stung my eyes. The next time it did not sting my eyes but felt greasy because the weather was humid. I dont think the sunscreen is to be blamed for that. It’s major con (and everyone knows that) is the quantity for the price it is sold. No white cast. Might think of repurchasing but not sure about it.\n\nIngredients- Aqua, Alcohol Denat, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Isopropyl Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Tocophérol Acétate, Phenoxyethanol, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, PEG-8 Laurate, Palmitic Acid, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide/​Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Linalool, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Geraniol, Disodium EDTA, Ceteth-10, Potassium Hydroxide, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum/​Fragrance (F.I.L. C161957/​2)\n\n**Price and Availability-** Rs 515 for 30ml. Usually available on a discounted price of 400 something on Nykaa.\n\nVerdict- I will continue purchasing The Blessing Tree sunscreen. This sub introduced me to this budget friendly option and I am so grateful! The other sunscreens mentioned here are also good, never broke me out (my skin is not sensitive so maybe that’s why) so it totally depends on what you are looking for. I am anticipating queries about Oxybenzone and Co ‘s safety- please do read up on it. They are safe. The only issue with older chemical sunscreen filters is their instability. The newer ones are more stable so I’d definitely explore some of the newer filters in the future. **Other than that- it is more important to wear sunscreen, even if it offers very basic protection than to not wear sunscreen at all.** I hope this review will be helpful! Please ask away anything you would like to in the comments. I will try my best to answer them. (I will also post this under the sunscreen thread).",

I bought it off Nykaa\n\n**Skin info:** Combination. Sometimes, it is combination-dry, sometimes combination-oily, sometimes normal. When it is oily-dry, it is oily around the nose and cheeks but the tip of my nose and chin will be dry. Its weird and really depends on my water consumption. It has been looking dull and dehydrated this past month.**Climate:** Humid, Hot, Rainy (currently)\n\n**Ingredients list:**  Water, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol,                             Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Coco–Glucoside, Poloxamer 407, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methyl Paraben, Menthol, Disodium EDTA,                          Petrolatum, Allantoin, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hyaluronate,                            Perfume, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, CI 42090\n\n**Packaging:** Just like the photo. Comes in a plastic tub. You have to dip your finger in it to pick up the product.\n\n**Texture:** Looks like a light custard in the tub (it jiggles) but spreads like a light gel. It is described as a gel creme on the packaging and the description fits.\n\n**Usage:** Been using it two-three times a day since the 28th of September. In the morning, I spread a light layer on my damp skin after washing my face with Neutrogena Extra Gentle Face Wash. If I am reapplying during the day, I just clean my face with water and apply it on damp skin. At nights, I repeat the morning routine and spread a light layer on my damp skin after washing my face.   \nOn October 1, I had to go out and applied Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sun Screen over it. On October 3rd morning, I applied Biotique Bio-Dandelion Serum after washing my face and then applied this gel on top. On October 3rd night, I mixed a drop of glycerine with the vaseline gel and applied on my damp skin after cleansing.   \nI have also increased my water intake so that is one thing that will contribute to my skin looking better. I am doing nothing else in my routine so far.\n\n**Opinion:** I love it (so far). It spreads smoothly across the skin and sinks into my skin easily.  At one point I felt that it absorbed too easily and perhaps I needed more on my skin but as soon as I splashed water on my face, I saw this light sheen blocking the water (probably because of the silicone). It feels a little cool when I apply it (because of the menthol) and tingles my eyes a wee bit (but doesn't hurt or make my eyes water. I actually like the tingling sensation on my skin). It keeps my skin feeling soft, smooth and moisturised for a long time. My skin felt a tad bit oily when I applied a thick layer though (however it could be because I sweat a lot that day). This combines well with both my Biotique serum (which is more like a light moisturiser than a serum) and glycerine. It does have a light fragrance (doesn't bother me at all) that seems to go away in a couple of minutes.\n\nI plan to add to this review and write about my whole basic routine at the end of the month. But my first impressions about this product are great. For those with dryer skin or living in dryer climates, you might need to apply a thicker layer of this to feel the benefits. I have never used the Ponds Gel that everyone loves. But looking at the ingredients list, this Vaseline Gel Creme could possibly be a substitute (I personally feel the ingredients are better but I am a beginner at this and could be wrong)\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this product.\n\n\nEdited to add:  I did notice a couple of tiiiiiny white heads around my chin and cheeks. And I seem to have a pimple forming near my nose. But I don't know if I can attribute it to the Vaseline gel. On 29th and 30th, I had to go to work and was wearing my mask for 5+ hours and its almost that time of the month. So I don't know if this product is clogging my pores and causing the one pimple and three whiteheads. I don't have a \"break out\" so can't say yet. Will be able to give a more informed opinion when I give a full review.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sc2z56tdu0r51.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c42ec854fa29737c2bfeff62a44ddd5bc341294",

    "body": "I have short wavy to curly hair that generally gets very frizzy. It is dry, with normal scalp. I have a lot (A LOT) of really thick hair. It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product? My wallet and I thank you in advance.**",

Since March 17 th\n\nMy experience: I don't have much experience with sunscreens . Previously I was using the suncros soft matte gel spf 50 sunscreen outdoors and Lakme spf 50 sunscreen lotion indoors . I didn't mind using the suncros under makeup as it makes excellent makeup base , but for the days I didn't wear makeup it felt weird just to wear it alone . So I was trying to find something for the days I didn't wear makeup and this loreal sunscreen got introduced . \n\nNow coming to the proper review . I initially measured the Sunscreen using a syringe to know how many fingers is 0.8 ml (for face , see doctorly spf calculation video) and it was one finger length.  I use Vaseline spf 30 for neck and body . And I was shocked to use this sunscreen , it was light , moisturising and yet somehow didn't make my t-zone oily even after half day of wear . And it didn't leave any white cast (the reason I chose this over other varients). Though it was sufficient for my normal and oily skin areas ,it was a tad bit drying on my perioral area on some days , so on those days I apply ponds superlight gel on my peri oral area before applying this sunscreen . I apply it as dots to my whole face and use a single finger pulp to spread it .And reapplication was a dream . It didn't pill , no balling up of sunscreen . And it didn't make white sweat . However it did make me sweat a little on my upper lips area as soon as I applied it ,till it set , I didn't find this when I applied it under fan and I say under fan for 5 minutes till the sunscreen set completely. It didn't clog my pores . I didn't tan on the short 30 minutes travel I took in the 1 pm sun in two wheeler (I was only wearing a  use and throw surgical mask ,as I was the passenger and not the driver ), so I think this works . It does have a mild floral fragrance ,like Lily mixed with something else , but it goes away within 30 s of application. Overall I WRP  and recommend it to me normal to oily skinned peers .\n\nWill I repurchase it ? Hell yes . But not for 700 inr . I will wait till a sale and it goes as low as 475 inr, like it did the last time I bought it from Myntra .\n\nCons : only comes in a 50 g pack and larger quantities not available . And too much plastic waste , as it comes in a plastic pouch with all the details in it .\n\nPs: I did post an image review , but I don't know where that went ,it is not even showing up on my posts . \n I found the original image post , via the mod message .  Here it is , for people who needs swatch pics - https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/tv3pnz/loreal_uv_defender_serum_sunscreen_matte_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share.",

Whatever is very faint...\n\nAnd while these days I don't get the body wash because I want to avoid plastic where I can when I can, the body cream: **yes.** It has 10% of a complex that includes both lactic acid and urea, and on the inci I read it also has retinol:\n\n*Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum Mineral Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-100 Stearate, Dimethicone, Urea, Sodium Lactate, Lecithin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Rosa Moschata Seed Oil, Zea Mays Oil, Calcium Pantothenate, Inositol, Retinol, Biotin, PEG-20 Castor Oil, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Alcohol Denat, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower ) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Parfum (Fragrance), Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citral, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glycine, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Citrate*\n\nI have KP and this does help keep my skin smoother.

Matrix hydrasource mask was the only thing that has even come close to my hg but unfortunately they stopped selling the mask on retail basis and it is intended only for saloon purpose and with the pandemic I don't think I will be stepping into a salon anytime soon. So I was looking for an affordable alternative and someone in this sub mentioned this one. Now the coming to ingredients \n\nMatrix biolage hydrasource mask- \nAqua , Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, stearyl alcohol,Cetyl Esters, fragrance,  Phenoxyethanol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis / Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride , sodium citrate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Linalool, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxycitronellal, Amyl Cinnamal. \n\n Loreal total repair 5 masque - \nWater, cetearyl alcohol, mineral oil, dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylmonium methosulphate, cetyl esters, lactic acid, phenoxyethanol , trideceth-6 , chlorhexidine digluconate, limonene, benzyl salicylate, amodimethacone, 2-oleamido-1,3-octadecanediol, fragrance,cetrimonium chloride, butylphenyl methylpropional , Hexyl cinnamal.(they have reformulated since the last time I used it about 2 years ago)\n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\n     Now coming to texture , the loreal one is tad bit thicker than the matrix mask and the slip provided is also lesser than the matrix mask. So I needed about 1.5 times  the amount as matrix one . The shine provided by both are same .They both act similarly when it come to making my waves form and hold. The loreal one is not as moisturising as the Matrix mask , and the frizz is also a little more than matrix mask.  So overall I would say  loreal total repair mask comes close to matrix by about 85%  . And it is costlier than the matrix biolage hydrasource mask, so I will again start my search once this one gets over.",

Both products made my hair look good and it took forever to get rid of the actual product, so you definitely get your money's worth. \n\nHowever, I did get build up.

Added bonus: one box lasts twice as long as that bottle of $15 scent beads, turning your $2 into $30 with a $28 savings.\n\nI use about 4 tablespoons per wash, and as it's baking soda, I can actually cut my detergent amount in half.\n\nArm & Hammer FTW.",

I am a bit scared to use this,not gona lie, because of all the heavy ingredients, but winters tend to get very dry where my hostel is, hence I am going to go out on a limb and try this out. \n\n2. UV doux sunscreen-pretty self explanatory. This is one of the most raved about sunscreens right now. I am trying to hate pan my Lotus gloop (the damn thing refuses to finish wtf dude)\n\n3. Dermafique toner- i have checked out the ingredient list and it seems interesting (Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260). \n\nI am not big on toners, but seeing panthenol so high up on the ingredient list made me so happy. \n\n4. Aveeno dermexa emollient cream- although I have one body butter and a body lotion to finish up, I still want to go for this lotion solely for my hands and feet. My knuckles tend to get very dry(and sometimes bleed) during extreme dry winters and this looks like could help. \n\n5. Baidyanath/dabur almond oil- i always buy a bottle of almond oil before the winter begins. It is an amazing all purpose product. \n\n6. Sebamed foaming face wash- i am currently using cetaphil. I want to try out something else. No specific reason for choosing sebamed out of everything else. I am not fussy about facial cleansers. \n\n7. Fabindia charcoal face mask- I have used this one before and this cleared up my skin like no other. Fabindia's products are incredibly underrated. This is one Indian homegrown brand that I can fully get behind. I have used quite a few of their stuff and none disappointed me. \n\n8. Neutrogena lip balm with SPF15- no specific reason for choosing this one out of all. Just wanted to try out a lip balm with spf. \n\n9. Any one of nykaa's moi perfumes- I simply love perfumes. i have the one in black(can't remember the name). I want to try out more of their perfume line. I will stick to the minis for now. \n\nThat is all that I have in my wishlist for now! Share us yours!",

I was wondering if there was a cheaper shampoo out there that had similar ingredients/properties/etc. I know that it contains a \"patented Healthy Hair Molecule (OFPMA)\" so it may be difficult to find something close enough. \n\n**Some Background Info:**\n\nI have fine/thin shoulder length virgin (undyed) hair. I don't use any styling products or tools. I typically shampoo every two days, air dry, detangle with a wide tooth comb when dry, and wear up in a loose messy bun most of the time. I don't use conditioner.\n\nMy current apartment has very hard water, and I don't have the option of installing a water softener or anything like that. \n\nSulfate free or low sulfate shampoos don't clean my scap well enough, and shampoos with SLS or SLES tend to irritate my scalp and cause increased hair fallout. \n\nLiving Proof shampoo is the only one I've found that cleans well, does not strip or dry my hair, and leaves my scalp happy. It's just lovely silky hair and a balanced scalp. I am not knowledgeable enough, however, to figure out why!\n\n**The ingredients list is here:** \n\n*Water/Eau/Aqua, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Octafluoropentyl Methacrylate (OFPMA), PCA Glyceryl Oleate, Behenyl Alcohol, PEG-150 Pentaerithrityl Tetrastearate, IPDI/PEG-15 Soyamine Copolymer Dimer Dilinoleate, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleammonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-47, Laureth-4, Laureth-23, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Fragrance/Parfum, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Magnesium Nitrate, Magnesium Chloride.*",

    "body": "Looks like we are receiving more scalp-targeted skin care products which is very exciting! There are little scalp focused products (although there are more lately in the form of scalp acids).\n\nThis line also has a shampoo but the treatment/conditioner is what I would really like to discuss. What's different, from just a glance, is that it's more \"dermatologically\" proven. It claims that the ingredients used are \"certified by Korean ministry of food and drug safety\" and it is also \"certified as low irritation through a rigorous skin patch test by Korean dermatology research institute.\"\n\nThis product REALLY caught my eye because I am constantly looking for more scalp-care products. It is my understanding that conditioner shouldn't touch the scalp, (especially if you are acne prone). I have a sensitive scalp prone to inflammation which is why I am very interested in scalp care. If this product is everything the marketing for it claims then this might just be a holy grail for scalp-focused skin-carers.\n\nPY's approach is interesting because most conditioner seem to be formulated as a hair conditioner first and skin conditioner second. In my experience, products formulated like this tends to leave an irritating residue as the consideration for the scalp is secondary. Their testing seems to be addressing this.\n\nI don't pay much attention to the hair loss claim in itself (only in terms of how much it improves scalp health which obviously affects hair health in the long term).\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:This hair conditioner is designed with scalp-contact in mind making this product stand out from most other I've seen on the market (something like a wash off scalp mask + hair conditioner)\\*\\*\n\nIt seems like a pretty new product (so long shot asking if anyone has used it) but this is product really caught my eye so I will try it out and report back.\n\nif this seems like an ad for this brand, it's not. I'm just really passionate about scalp health lmfao (check my posting history and rifle through the housewives and university posts)\n\nany thoughts on this product's formulation or comments on scalp-care asian products in general?

At the time it was cheaper than Stirling. I paid about $10 each for soap and balm. I haven't heard much about it in the intervening years but thought this series might be a good chance to get No. 63 a little attention.\n\nPDP 63 is a quadruple milled vegan soap, as you may have guessed, it's French. \n\nThe listed ingredients are:  *Potassium Palmate, Sodium Palmate, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Glycerin, Water (Aqua), Palm Kernel Acid, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Chloride, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Pentasodium Penetate, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Rosemary (Rosmarinus Officinalis) Extract, Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil, Citronellol, Coumarin, D-Limonene, Eugenol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool*\n\n The soap is and *incredibly* hard puck that comes in a labelled the tin works on a basic level, stores that sell that helps keep it fresh between uses. But there is simply not enough room in the container to load or lather your brush. This seems like a big oversight.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As I mentioned this soap is super firm. As such it will probably last a long time, and outlast the aftershave balm by a good bit.  It also makes loading a brush tricky. I normally am a scooper and am thankful for that when using PDP 63. Even when the soap is bloomed for a few minutes it can be tough to load to a brush, especially in the all too tiny tin.  I recommend scooping some off (with a spoon or something unless you want to rip off your fingernail) *then* blooming in your lathering chalice of choice before proceeding to actual lather the soap.\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little bit of this soap goes a very long way and I always find that I have scooped more than I  needed.  Dialing in this lather is a bit tricky, I am not sure if it is just a lesser vegan soap, or maybe it's affected by my local tap water. The lather starts out foamy  but with some work gets denser and somewhat creamy.  Number 63 offers a solid bit of cushion but just doesn't match artisan offerings for slickenss primary or residual.  Post shave feel is another let down with my face feeling significantly drier than I experience with most artisan soaps. The associated post shave balm is quite nice however and gets the face feeling fresh.\nWhile performance here is nothing special it is more than adequate given you have solid technique with the only real downside being the need to reapply leather between every pass and before touch ups. This is not something that is necessary with most Artisan soaps.\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PDP 63 redeems itself in the scent department. Pre de Provence describes the scent thusly: *Aromatic, warm and spicy in nature, our Men's No.63  is a classic expression of masculine fragrance with a peppery citrus top note rounded by woody cedarwood, juicy plum, and violet leaves that finish into an ambery base of leather and tobacco*\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This a warm and very complex scent. It is a very cologne-ish blend that works well. It is a strong yet diffuse scent. There is a bright peppery opening that descends to to a rich heart of cedar  and plum. I do not notice violet leaves but mild aromatic leather leads into amber which buts up to a very sweet and mild tobacco with just a touch of spice to finish the note.  Strong and sweet, a well rounded scent with no sharp corners. \n\nI certainly have not kept No. 63 around for its stellar performance or exotic label art, but the warm classic scent is always a joy to shave with. \n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I really enjoy the scent on this soap it is not quite as tobacco forward as either Cognac and Cuban Cigars or Havana Vieja. It is a more original scent, not being a cologne dupe and it is very well balanced and rich. I personally usually prefer to opt for a more straightforward tobacco note but this type of scent has its applications and would probably be more acceptable on a date night than something like Cognac and Cuban  Cigars.\n\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ranking different scents is a lot more difficult than I would have guesser before starting this series. Obviously in day-to-day life I have certain scents that I prefer,  scents that I turn to more regularly,  and some that I only pull out for certain occasions,  despite enjoying them all. The scent on PpD 63 is in very close contention with Havana Vieja and in this case I will be using performance as a tie- breaker. With that weight added to the scale Havana Vieja becomes a clear winner. Nonetheless, Nom 63 is a still a worthwhile purchase especially for tobacco officianados. But better performance is ubiquitous in the artisanal community. The price of PpD 63 has gone up substantially since I purchased my set, it now costs more than Stirling, Noble Otter, Seaforth, B&M Sets w\\ balm, and many other far better performing soaps so I am not sure how strongly I can recommend it on anything other than scent. The underwhelming and underperforming soap tin don't help to push things over the top. But the scent is great and there is a whole line of associated mens grooming prpducts with matching scents if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nRight now the Tobacco Throwdown standings are as such:\n\n* 1. Henri et Victoria Cognac and Cuban Cigars\n\n* 2. Highland Springs Soap Company Havana Vieja\n\n* 3. Pre De Provence No. 63\n\n \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  All three of the soaps reveiwed so far are excellent scents. \nHSSCs Havana Vieja Provides some exceptional performance in a slick vegan base and has  nice dupe scent of Tom Fords Vanilla Tobacco. The current leader HeV Cognac and Cuban Cigars is another milled soap but tallow based that combines great performance with a refines and unique scent.  Pre De Prvence No. 63 brings up the rear with average performance but heartwarming sweet tobacco and cedar scent. There are still a lot of great soapa and scents to come so please stay tuned for Round 4 this weekend!",

And if you use plenty of soap and make a nice wet, almost drippy lather the performance is very good. Maybe a notch below the top hard, milled European soaps (Tabac, SdM) but still very good.\n\nWhen you're dealing with a hard puck like this, I find this is the best way to make lather: wet your face, take the soap in your left hand and then *rub the puck on your face.* All over your stubble. Now take your damp brush in your right hand and swirl it around on the puck for a while-- a good 30 seconds or more. Then bring the soapy brush to your soapy face and start swirling around to make lather. Add drops of water to the brush now and then and continue until you've got a nice wet, almost drippy, shiny lather. Then use a few back-and-forth paintbrush strokes to slap an even layer of lather into your face. \n\nHere's a haiku to use as a mnemonic device:\n\nAlways remember,  \nmy son: rub the puck on your  \nmotherfuckin' face.",

I think the soap was going for $10, and the balm was $13 when I put them on my list. The soap performance is better than some vegan bases like Black Ship Grooming and Italian Barber, and similar to The Sudsy Soapery and LA Shave Co. But, not as good as Stirling. The bath soap was nice.\n\nI wasn't expecting you to review it. I didn't consider it to be a tobacco fragrance. For some reason, I remember the description being a fragrance resembling a drive through the countryside. Spicy and cologne-like is accurate. The fragrance is definitely the selling point.",

    "body": "In my attempt to refresh my love of wetshaving it seems like I'm looking to what artisan soaps are in the EU. Like many of our fellow EU wetshavers they don't get many NA brands and we don't see as many EU brands, but it's a bit easier for us due to regulations. One brand that came across my radar was E&S Rasage, a husband and wife team from France that was popping up a bit online and at some retailers.\n\nI was curious about them then saw a set on the BST for cheap and figured why not. The set I acquired is [Zenith](https://es-rasage.com/en/collections/zenith) a \"Floriental\" scent as they describe it. I'll talk about the scent more later as this wasn't my focus it was the base itself. \n\n When we think France for shaving we think of the classics, [Martin de Candre](https://www.martin-de-candre.com/en/), [La Savonnière du Moulin](https://la-savonniere-du-moulin.com/), [Le Père Lucien](https://www.leperelucien.com/), and other similar brands. What most of these have in common except for LPL is that they are hard triple milled vegan base soaps, where LPL is a much softer artisan style soap in some various bases. E&S is more like a traditional artisan tallow base with goat's milk, lanolin and other butters, their base is as followed: \n\n> Ingredients: Potassium Stearate, Caprae Lac, Glycerin, SodiumStearate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Safflowerate, Potassium Castorate, Parfum, Persea Gratissima Oil, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Extract, Sodium Shea Butterate, Sodium Cocoa Butterate, Sodium Castorate, Sodium Cocoa Butterate, Sodium Castorate Potassium Cocoate, Silk Powder, Stearic Acid, Potassium Lanolate, Sodium Cocoate, Allantoin, Sodium Lanolate, Tocopherol, Adeps Bovis, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuos Seed Oil, Cocianthus Annuus Seed Oil Nucifera Oil, Lanolin, Coumarin, Limonene, Eugenol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Methyl 2-Octyonate.\n\n------\n\n**Loading & Lathering**\n\nThis soap took a bit to load, it could have been the brush I was using the tips were too soft, took a few seconds longer but got the brush loaded fine. Maybe some scrubbier tips would grab the soap easier but minor things people. \n\nThe lathering portion took a bit longer to get to where I wanted to but a few extra seconds of patience while properly hydrating lead to a very dense and heavy lather with a high water tolerance, I could have pushed it more but no need in my eyes. \n\n**The Shave**\n\nI had 3 days of growth and my straight just wiped away the hair like nothing on the first pass. The lather is plenty slick for straights and for our DE users would have plenty of protection and cushioning. A 2 pass shave and some extra clean up left my face with a very nice DFS shave, BBS is impossible for me. The residual slickness felt very nice and good for clean up spots if needed. \n\n**The Splash**\n\nThe splash is pretty simple with the ingredients as followed:\n\n> Alcohol Denat., Hamamelis Virginiana, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Parfum, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Coumarin, Limonene, Eugenol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Methyl 2-Octyonate.\n\nI got a pretty big bite from it, not sure if it was the alcohol or scent but after 10 min my face was smooth and comfortable. It didn't have that super soft and tacky feel like some soaps and splashes give but it was just normal as the best way I can put it. \n\n**The Scent**\n\nI'm not going to focus on this much as I just cared about the base more, but Zenith is a warm floral scent, they describe it as: \n\n> The floral and spicy notes of ZENITH will bring you softness and well-being while leaving your skin delicately scented long after its application. Balanced fragrance, breath of freshness at the top with bergamot, the heart is warmed with enveloping notes of iris, jasmine and rose, and a base marked by the imprint of vanilla and the roundness of woody notes.\n \nTo me it was like a cousin of [Mickey Lee Soapworks - Bodhisattva](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/835/?product_type=soap). This scent isn't quite for me so will sell it.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nSimply put the best artisan soap out of France and a really good EU artisan base too, scents are different with a solid variety. I would personally ignore the splash if buying a soap, it's more than the soap and I don't think as good, but if you want to get it get it. But I wouldn't hesitate to try the soap new or used. \n\n**Disclaimer**: I already said it, bought it on the BST.",

It's travel friendly and can easily fit even in your small purses. \n\n**My Experience:** My first impression wasn't that great. There's a mild fragrance that reminds me of syringes, but it doesn't linger long so not too bothersome. Further, I couldn't help thinking my skin felt heavy on application. The packaging states to avoid the eye area & they aren't kidding. My eyes tingled a lot, not coz the product went in my eyes. It wasn't exactly in my under eye area too, but a little must have been accidentally applied, and yet I felt the urge to splash my eyes with water. \n\nAfter a week or so, the stinging & burning eyes sensation was no longer. I realised why my skin felt heavy too. It's so, so hot in summers, we are already sweating, and this sunscreen is not sweatproof. On its application, I could sense some sweat on my face after a while. It's not too heavy on my skin, but heavy enough to make my face sweat.\n\nThe product blends nicely, has no white cast, and does not pill. So kudos to that! The texture is light enough to be mom greasy, a better formulation than Neutrogena sunscreen in that sense.\n\n**WRP:** I might come back to this due to its packaging & it being less heavier than Neutrogena. But I'll still be on the lookout for new & better Sunscreen.",

The packaging is sleek and attractive, making it easy to carry in your bag for quick touch-ups. The formula itself is lightweight and doesn't leave a heavy residue, which is a major plus. It effectively absorbs oil and adds volume to limp hair, giving it a refreshed and clean look. However, it may not be as effective on very oily hair, and you might need to reapply throughout the day. The scent is light and pleasant, but it can be a bit strong for those sensitive to fragrances.\n\nPros:\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight formula\n- Adds volume\n- Pleasant scent\n\nCons:\n- May need reapplication\n- Not as effective on very oily hair\n- Scent might be strong for some\n\nWNRP\n\n2.

The formula is enriched with ingredients that help to extend the life of your style and add texture without feeling gritty. The scent is a luxurious floral fragrance that lingers subtly throughout the day. It also offers a nice boost of volume, making it perfect for those days when your hair needs a little extra lift. The only downside is that it is on the pricier side compared to other dry shampoos. May not work for very oily hair.\n\nPros:\n- No white residue\n- Extends style life\n- Adds volume and texture\n- Luxurious scent\n\nCons:\n- More expensive \n- Not as effective on very oily hair\n- Scent may be strong for some\n\nWNRP\n\n3. Redken Deep Clean Dry Shampoo\n\nIngredients:\nIsobutane, Alcohol Denat., Propane, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Calcium Carbonate, Polyvinylcaprolactam, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Linalool, Citronellol, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Benzyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance.\n\nReview:\nRedken Deep Clean Dry Shampoo is a powerhouse for those who need a heavy-duty product. It’s formulated to tackle even the oiliest of hair, providing a deep clean that extends the time between washes. This dry shampoo leaves hair feeling genuinely clean without the typical dry shampoo residue. It has a neutral scent that is not overpowering, making it suitable for those sensitive to fragrances. While effective, it can sometimes leave hair feeling a bit dry, so it’s best used in moderation or paired with a moisturizing product.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent for very oily hair\n- Provides a deep clean\n- Neutral scent\n- Professional packaging\n\nCons:\n- Can leave hair feeling dry\n- Best used in moderation\n- Very costly for the quantity \n\nWRP",

    "body": "I just picked up my package - a much-anticipated restock of my daily bb cream which I ordered from Missha's US website - only to discover the ingredients have been altered from my last haul. A lot of the good stuff that I loved for the skin benefits has been moved down the list considerably. I've always loved this bb cream because the #13 shade fits my skin pretty perfectly, and I'm generally demanding of my makeup in that I want it to be making me look better in the long run as well as the short run. Missha's ingredient list seemed to have some pretty great additions to do just that; It had a decent Pa protection rating and some ingredients I valued such as arbutin, squalane, adenosine, and ceramide.  Now... I think I might start looking for a new daily bb cream. Something with a similar shade, equal or better sun protection, but more potent anti-aging and completion-improving ingredients. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them! \n\nFor the curious - I've included the ingredient lists for comparison. While the old list can be found on various old reviews (such as one I grabbed from [here](http://nouveaucheap.blogspot.com/2012/09/review-missha-perfect-cover-bb-cream.html), the latest rendition on [missha's site](http://www.misshaus.com/m-perfect-cover-bb-cream-spf-42-pa.html) has some considerable changes, at least IMHO. Maybe it's less a big deal to others, idk.\n\nOld Ingredients:\n> Water(Aqua), Cyclomethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Zinc Oxide, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mineral Oil, Phenyl Trimethicone, Talc, Arbutin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Dimethicone, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Squalane, Adenosine, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Polyethylene, Beeswax(Cera Alba), Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Caviar Extract, Algae Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Fagus Sylvatica Bud Extract, Ceramide 3, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance(Parfum), Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxycitronellal, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Citronellol\nMAY CONTAIN[+/-; Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891), Iron Oxides(CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499)]\n\nLatest Rendition:\n>Water (aqua), cyclomethicone, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, zinc oxide, propylene glycol, titanium dioxide, caprylic/capric triglyceride, peg-10 dimethicone, cetyl peg/ppg-10/1 dimethicone, arbutin, mineral oil, glycerin, polyethylene, talc, phenyl trimethicone, beeswax (cera alba), iron oxides (ci 77492), sodium chloride, iron oxides (ci 77491 ), iron oxides (ci 77499), methylparaben, dimethicone, propylparaben, rosa canina fruit oil, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, squalane, hydrolyzed collagen, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, disodium edta, adenosine, caviar extract, algae extract, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, sodium hyaluronate, fagus sylvatica bud extract, ceramide 3, fragrance (parfum), hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, butylphenyl methylpropional, benzyl salicylate, hydroxycitronellal, alpha-isomethyl ionone, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, citronellol\n\n**EDIT**: Just fixed a link and some formating :P",

Hasn’t been sold for about 3 years I think): \n\nAqua / Water,Cyclohexasiloxane,Nylon-12,Isododecane,Alcohol Denat.,Cyclopentasiloxane,PEG-10 Dimethicone,Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone,PEG-20,Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate,Disteardimonium Hectorite,Phenoxyethanol,Magnesium Sulfate,Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate,HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer,Titanium Dioxide [Nano] / Titanium Dioxide,Methylparaben,Acrylonitrile/Methyl Methacrylate/Vinylidene Chloride Copolymer,Tocopherol,Butylparaben,Aluminum Hydroxide,Isobutane,Alumina,Silica,Glycerin,Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate\n\nFast forward to 2 months ago I ruined my hair with Garnier ultimate blends coconut oil shampoo (I forgot this brand ruined my hair in the past):\n\nAqua/Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, CI 14700/Red 4, Cocos Nucifera/Coconut Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxycitronellal, Sodium Hydroxide, Theobroma Cacao Shea Butter/Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Caramel, Citric Acid, Hexylene Glycol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum / Fragrance\n\n(Though I do think my hair is bad with coconut oil, I’m not sure if that’s the sole reason as the result is basically the same as when I used this shampoo in the past) \n\nI initially thought that it’s because my hair is already dry and coarse (as well as low porosity fyi) that these shampoos didn’t do me much good as they have drying alcohols and a few sulphates, and nothing that is really moisturising or nourishing. Though, I thought about it more, and in between the two periods I ruined my hair, I was using this shampoo by Herbal & Essences which also does seem pretty drying, but didn’t damage my hair at all (from what I saw physically):\n\nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Magnesium Nitrate, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Rose Extract, Pearl Extract, CI 19140, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, CI 42090\n\nIt in fact has more sulphates, but also more humectants at the same time. Could it be the alcohol? Or is the problem in fact, not the drying of my hair? I’m really lost and scared to buy another shampoo in case I ruin my hair again.",

Also if something works for you, then it works for you, ingredients list shouldn't be what makes or breaks it for you because cosmetic formulators are not idiots)\n\nThese are supposed to be moisturising hair masks... But here's the thing... there's no humectant... Not even one.\n\nBoth of these have fatty alcohol which provide that soft feel you'll be getting after using them and the cationic surfactant behentrimonium chloride will provide the slip for detangling but there's no humectant which imo feels like an essential ingredient in a hair mask, not even the humble glycerine... (Granted there is straight up water for hydration but really... Buying moisturising hair mask that depends on water for hydration?)\n\nI've seen curly hair influencers reviewing them saying though they provide slip they don't moisture their hair which kinda makes sense. These feel like detangling conditioners rather than moisturising hair masks. (again this is an opinion formed solely by looking at the ingredients list which isn't the be all end all)",

I've been through many products the last year or so trying to find new products for my hair that fit me. I have long silky and straight hair but it gets easily split ends and can get very tangled in the mornings..\n\nI have recently tried a new brand though - the biosilk shampoo and conditioner plus silk treatment. I have paid much for hair salon shampoo and conditioners but these did not work as good as the biosilk products. I'm very surprised how good they work for my hair, the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair instantly combable after showering, which I've never experienced before!

If so, what was your experience with them?\n\n\nIngredients in the shampoo:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Polysorbate 20, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.\n\nIngredients in the conditioner:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Amodimethicone, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol , Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-8, Citric Acid, Benzophenone-3, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol.\n\n\nI noticed the conditioner has citric acid and cetyl alcohol in it, I've heard acid can let good moisture in the hair as well as bad stuff..\nAre the ingredients good for my hair/scalp? Should I continue using it without worry?\n\nThanks for replies in advance!!",

The fourth ingredient is amodimethicone (following water, cetearyl alcohol, and behentrimonium chloride). I'd use it with a shampoo containing cocamidopropyl betaine. I saw a gentle shampoo from Cantu that looks like it could work really well, but for some reason the listed ingredients differ between websites. \n\nMy question is, would this conditioner work as a substitute for heat protectant spray? I flat iron on occasion. What if I were to use it as a leave-in? (This might be too heavy for my hair though). I'm not a huge fan of sprays because the spray usually gets on my face and can cause breakouts, and it's hard to get even coverage. \n\nEDIT: I also found this leave-in that supposedly only contains water-soluble silicones - [Bed Head Control Freak Serum](https://www.ulta.com/bed-head-control-freak-serum?productId=xlsImpprod4750119) - but it's a little pricey, and I also don't know if the water-soluble silicones are strong enough or high enough in the ingredient list to offer adequate heat protection.

Heat protection sprays are designed to protect from heat settings that get up to 450 degrees (depending on the product).\n You can test heat protection sprays and how well they buffer the heat.  1. Simply spray the product on one hand and leave the other hand free from product. I like a liquid spray. 2. Take a blow dryer and apply heat to the hand that has the spray. Count how many seconds you can withstand the heat from the dryer. 3. Next apply heat to the hand that doesn’t have product and count how long you can stand the heat.\n There should be a noticeable difference between the  heat. This will give you an idea of how effective your product is working. \n Also with liquid sprays you can spray the product your hand and apply to avoid contact with your face. Hope this helps.",

I wash my hair in the morning so I don’t really have time to do a two-step routine for my hair, or I’m really too lazy for it. Also I feel like manipulating my hair twice in the shower ends up with more hair on my drainage cap.\n\nBut the thing is I feel like my hair has been breaking and falling quite a bit, which I think is because it’s too dry and not properly conditioned. So I’m actually considering co-washing instead. \n\nI’ve had these two conditioners in my closet for a while that I have not used, and I’ve looked through the ingredients list, would they be ok to use for co-washing?\n\n**[Redken Frizz Dismiss Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/Redken-Dismiss-Conditioner-protection-smoothing/dp/B00UJZRO50)**\n\n> Aqua / Water / Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Paraffinum Liquidum / Mineral Oil / Huile Minerale, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Parfum / Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, PEG / PPG / Polybutylene Glycol-8 / 5 / 3 Glycerin, Pentaclethra Macroloba Oil / Pentaclethra Macroloba Seed Oil, Hexyl Cinnamal, BHT, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n\n\nThis one looks quite fine to me? It seems to be a silicone-free conditioner and I read that Behentrimonium Chloride is quite good to have in a hair cleanser and it doesn’t seem to have any problematic ingredients in the top five.\n\n**[Klorane Conditioner with Pomegranate ](https://www.amazon.com/Klorane-Conditioner-Pomegranate-5-1-fl/dp/B000Q34W0K)**\n\n> Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Alcohol, Ceteareth-33, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Isopropyl Alcohol, Methyparaben, Punica Granatum extract, Red 4 (CI 14700), Trideceth-12\n\n\nIt seems the only problem for this one could be the Amodimethicone? Which I gather from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/?st=JGTIBFB0&sh=8c65316e) that it can be hard to wash off but does not cause a build up. I have briefly looked up the rest of the ingredients and they don’t seem to have serious red flags (except maybe the parabens). Is it still ok to use for cowash?\n\nI plan to shampoo with a sulfate-free shampoo once a week.",

I did a little research online, and checked prices online (for stores I have in my reigon) and notices that their price range was around 50$ each.. which, I cant really afford.\n\nBut today, while my younger sister was getting herself some self care goodies, I noticed that this very well known store has a product that contains Vitamin E, Vitamin C & Vitamin A for the price of 36$. Sounds almost too good to be true! Which, maybe it is, so I have few questions:\n\n1. Can those 3 vitamins be mixed together and still be effective?\n\n\n2. I've did a little research online after finding this product, and saw an article that said that while buying facial serums you would want them in a tinted/ colored bottle so the product wont be damaged from the sun(?).. the product I found is in a clear bottlw; how bad will it be?\n\n\n3. Along the articles, I read that it is best to apply the serum to your face after toner and before mosturizer.. is the toner part necessary..?\n\n\n4. I've read those vitamins can be causing allergic reactions (if you are unaware you are allergic to them when externally used; while internal doesnt give any alergic reaction) & to not use them if you have oily/ dehydrated skin.. how true is that?\n\n\n5. I have a list of the ingredients, does any one of those looks like a bad one to have in it? :\n\n\nCyclomethicone & Dimethiconol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Isononyl Isononanoate, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Triclosan, Retinyl Palmitate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool, Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene.\n\n\n6. I've also read that keeping the serum in the fridge will make it last longer. Anyone does this & has it made your product last longer?\n\n\nI know it is a long of questions; but I want to make sure I'm paying for something that will give me the results I want.\n\nThank you so much in advance",

Ran out a week ago and noticed a packaging change when picking up my new tube. The feel of the cream is noticeably different and I've started breaking out badly. Reviews on NYX's site, Ulta, and Amazon all confirm that this reaction is pretty across-the-board. Seems there might be a few of the old-formula tubes floating around, so grab them if you see them!

The new one had poor coverage, made me ridiculously oily, and gave me cystic acne. I have tried so many products to try to replace it. The closest dupe I've found is Sephora's bright future skin tint. I was using nyx bb cream in the lightest shade nude and and shade no. 7 (light ivory) in the skin tint worked well for me. It didn't quite blend in to my skin as easily as the old nyx bb, but I started using a damp beauty blender with it with better results. Other products that were pretty close - wet n wild mega cushion foundation (light ivory) and CYO lifeproof foundation (shade 101). Unfortunately, I think these products may have been breaking me out slightly so I stopped using them. And if it helps, my skin type is pretty dry and flaky, especially around the nose and t-zone, but I also get oily around the forehead and cheeks by the end of the day. Hope this helps someone out there with the same struggles!",

    "body": "So far I co-washed two times.\n\nFirst time I did it the lush way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage, wash, put significant amount of conditioner on hair from roots to ends, wait, wash. The hair was clean, I think it was too clean, there was more resistance when brushing vs after shampoo washing, there was significantly more hair left on my hands (and on the brush when brushing too I think) when applying the product. I think the hair was somewhat sticky and waxy, but not too much.\n\nThe second time I did it the easy way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage (and in the process get a bit on the hair and ends too), wait, wash. The hair was clean enough (not shampoo-clean, but I think that's better for my hair and for my scalp's accomodation). There was more resistance when brushign vs after shampoo washing (and I think also vs the first co-wash). There too was significantly more hair left on my hands when applying the product, but because it was applied only once it was this much less hair loss. My hair is sticky, waxy. It looks good, but feels really bad, because of the stickiness.\n\nI used warm water.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if I brush my hair downwards while leaning down, the hair will literally stay in the air afterwards as if I gelled it or something. This effect is present to some extent after I shampoo-wash too, but not this extremely. It's also quite difficult to brush in the first place.\n\nThe conditioner somewhat sticks to the hair even while washing with it, the consistency of conditioner is gluey, sticky, it doesn't make my fingers run through my hair with conditioner applied run buttery smoothly, but rather the complete opposite, I'm scared of pulling my hair out this way... No hair loss when rinsing it off. \n\nMy scalp is also itchy as fuck now. My guess is the preservatives Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are to blame, but the thing is the shampoo has them too, so maybe not and the waxiness or whatever (co-washing in general) causes this?\n\nI'm pretty certain that the conditioner causes this. I didn't use any other product. When I wash with just shampoo from the same brand (it's SLES based, but it's the opposite of potent, I take few times more of it to achieve the same potency that normal SLS shampoos have, could be the conditioner is similarly \"potent\") and either don't use any other product or only few drops of oil it won't be like this and it's pretty much what I want.\n\nThe ingredients of the conditioner:\n> Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Inula Helenium Extract, Humulus Lupulus Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Cera Alba, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Chamomilla Recutita Oil, Geranium Sibiricum Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-12 Dimethicon, Pinus Sibirica Needle Extract, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Ceteareth-20, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nNote that Cera Alba (Bees wax), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (guar gum derivative) and PEG-12 Dimethicon (water-soluble sillicon) are in it. Could it be that the Bees wax is the problem? The two other ingredients are water soluble so shouldn't be... Cera Alba (Bees wax) is also in the shampoo, but probably in smaller quantity.\n\nIngredients of the shampoo:\n> Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract*, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Glycine Soja Oil, Urtica Dioica Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Water*, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract*, Salvia Officnalis Oil, Carum Carvi Fruit Oil, Mel*, Saponaria Officinalis Root Extract*, Cera Alba, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nShould I buy another conditioner, keep on using this one or switch to non-harsh shampoo? If I should switch conditioner, what ingredients should I be looking for except no wax and sillicon? No oils? Other surfactants (glucosides instead of kationic chlorides)? Something more oily? Something very minimalistic (just kationic surfactans like cetrimonium chloride and humectants like cetearyl alcohol)? Something with more humectants?  I wouldn't be super happy buying another conditioner just to find out it's trash and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nEdit: My hair is ~5inch/13cm long.",

        "body": "I'm no expert and this is just personal experience over the past several years but I would try an SLS-free shampoo & silicon-/wax-free conditioner to see if that helps. It sounds more like an issue with the conditioner ingredients or other products sticking to your hair and scalp then not getting washed out with the co-wash so it builds up on your hair more and more. I tried many conditioners to co-wash and also water-only but neither worked for me. My hair ended up stringy, heavy and waxy though not as quickly as you have experienced. I have very hard water where I live which can also add to the problem.  You can also look into an apple cider vinegar rinse as an alternative (lots of info on the side-bar).\n\nI have had good success with SLS-free shampoo plus silicon-free conditioner every second wash or so. I only have to wash it once a week with water-only rinses as needed in between washes and my scalp is much less itchy and dry than when I was using regular shampoo or co-washing. When particularly dry and itchy, I use jojoba oil on my scalp as a mask/cleanse before I shower, massage it in well, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash out . This also helps with any build-up of product on my scalp.\n\nIt will probably take some trial and error to find out what works for you and a bit of time for your scalp to transition. You may also need to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build-up on your hair before starting over to give you a clean start but not everyone needs that step.",

Simple. \n\nIf you are switching to low poo products and just using those, I would say it’s probably a bit of waxiness from transition. That’s normal and just a matter of lifting the waxiness (apple sauce mask, egg, or a full-poo shampoo) and forging ahead.  If you’re still using full poo products (which it looks like you are, regardless of how you’re using them) it’s probably just a bad formulation for you and/or the water coming out of your tap.   Find something inexpensive to try.  Burt’s Bees, L’Oreal Paris Evercurl or Evercreme cleansing conditioners, Nature’s Gate, VO5 conditioners in the white bottles (if they’re still packaged the same as when this list was made) are all fairly widely-available and often fairly inexpensive options.",

I've been reading and researching about it but got even more confused so I thought I'd ask here lol.\n\nAbout three weeks ago I decided to get one and my hairdresser told me not to use anything containing salt (but said nothing about sulfates, or i might have missed it lol). So, I got the Loreal Eversleek shampoo because its advertised as specifically made and a safe shampoo for keratin treated hair. After I got home I started reading the ingredient list and to my surprise, sodium chloride is listed as an ingredient! So I guess what im asking is if its safe to use? Has anyone tried it? Will it strip off the treatment out of my hair? I dont really get the \\~science\\~ behind it and the differences between using sodium and salts and sulfates.   \nI also have been using a sodium free but not sulfate free shampoo, and I dont really like it so I wanna know if this is safe and worth giving a shot. \n\nHere's the ingredient list: AQUA / WATER / EAU  \nSODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE  \nLAURETH-5 CARBOXYLIC ACID  \n**SODIUM CHLORIDE**  \nCOCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE  \nGLYCERIN  \nPEG-150 DISTEARATE  \nPARFUM / FRAGRANCE  \nCOCONUT ACID  \nSODIUM BENZOATE  \nSODIUM LAUROYL GLUTAMATE  \nPOLYQUATERNIUM-10  \nSALICYLIC ACID  \nHEXYL CINNAMAL  \nLINALOOL  \nBENZYL SALICYLATE  \nBENZYL ALCOHOL  \nHELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED EXTRACT / SUNFLOWER SEED EXTRACT  \nLIMONENE  \nCITRONELLOL  \nSODIUM HYDROXIDE  \nLACTIC ACID FIL CODE D55635/1\n\nAlso I think is worth mentioning Im from a little country located in South America, so my access to hair products is very limited, and the ones that we have are super overpriced compared to the states.\n\nThank you so much in advance !",

        "body": "I've been getting keratin treatments (and color) for years. My stylist has always told me to use sulfate-free products and to avoid anything (including styling products)  that has sodium chloride in the ingredient list. IIRC it has something to do with sodium chloride effectively stripping the keratin out of your hair and being abrasive. She explained it to me like this (I'm paraphrasing): You know how when you go swimming in the ocean (or gulf or whatever salt-water body of choice) and your wet hair dries its a little bit crunchy and clumpy? That's from the salt. \n\nScience time: Sulfates are derived from sulfuric acid. They are in a wide range of products, but their primary application is as a lathering or cleansing agent. You know how shampoos that have sulfates lather really really well and sulfate-free ones don't? That's why. Sulfate's purpose in this universe is to clean things and its really good at it. For a person with non-damaged, non-chemically treated a shampoo with sulfates is probably fine. \n\nHowever, for anyone with a compromised cuticle (the outer part of the hair strand; this includes anyone with color or chemical treatment) sulfates are sketchy because they're *too*  good at their job. Most clarifying shampoos just have a lot of sulfates in them.\n\nBottom Line: Your hair isn't gonna fall out or melt off and using the shampoo won't completely strip your treatment out all at once. But sulfates and sodium chloride will decrease the longevity of your treatment. Probably by 25-50%, depending on how frequently you wash your hair.\n\nNB: someone please fact-check my science, chemistry was a reeeaaaaallllly long time ago.",

(The alum is a gift from my family, the rest is bought with my own money over time)\n\n\n**ingredients**\n\nPotassium Tallowate, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Glycerin, Parfum, Parafinium, Liquidum, Tetrasodium EDTA, Etidronic Acid, Disodium Distrylbiphenly, Disuffonate Amyl Cinnamel, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool\n\n\n**thoughts**\n\n\nArko shave stick is something I have heard of many times and seen many times. Delivered in a bit of red foil with the for me classic logo, it was a bit messy to Open since the soap stuck to the foil wrapper. White with a small hint of yellow in colour,  it almost looks like a piece of handsoap. And the scent, a breeze hint of mild lemon, almost like a soft air refresher. The scent I have no troubles with at all, and it does fade over time. I have tried it some times,  and the results are mostly the same.\n\n\n\nWetting my face, really getting it soaked. And rubbing the soap stick all over my face, dipping it in the sink to replace the wet soap that got to my face.\n\n\nGetting a damp brush and just start to lather it right on there. Adding more water as i go, buildkng up a nice lather as I have done before. Getting a good glide is what I want. And you know what? Before I am done, the scent is gone. This is basically unscented, that short is the scent lasting. \n\n\nToday, a with the grain pass, followed by some more lathering, and a final pass of across the grain, but not on the neck. That place only got the with the grain.  And ouch, my face is dry. Rinse of with water, apply some alum, and remove it quickly because now the face is on fire! Witch hazel, Barrister and Mann reserve splash, and face moisturiser. Just to add good stuff to my skin. And aloe vera. And my face is still feeling dry and it hurts.\n\n\n**summary**\n\nI would give this a **2/10**, because the scent is pleasant and it can easily build a lather. But it hurts the skin. Hurts my skin. I am sorry if you like this soap, I do not. And it was not easy finding a listing of the ingredients,  what did i put on my face? I know now after some searching the Web, but it will probably be never again.",

I shaved the underside and deep conditioned with every wash it because it was all broken off, started washing my hair less (once every 3 or 4 days now), stopped using heat products, get haircuts every 8-10 weeks, and  tried buying better shampoos/conditioners for my hair.\n\n\nAt that time, I bought an olive oil shampoo/conditioner pair from Regis Designline and it seemed to work well. I've used it for a year now and my hair seems tired of it, so I tried purchasing some new ones after asking my hair dresser for a suggestion. I've tried Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Moisturizing Shampoo ( which is supposedly sulfate free and has argon oil in it) and also Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny line. Healthy Sexy Hair made my hair feel strawlike and Paul Mitchell's made it oily within a day, and feels almost waxy when it's drying. \n\n\nI've never dyed or permed my hair and have med-course and straight-wavy hair. I'm half Cambodian, half white, so I'm wondering if my hair chemistry is different from what they make products for. When doing at home masks, my hair seems to like olive oil. Since trying these shampoos, my hair has gotten frizzier, I've noticed new split ends that weren't there before, and is more tangled.

To avoid purchasing soaps that contain ingredients I'm allergic to I made up a list of all the ingredients I've encountered so far, and I would appreciate it if somebody could step through the list and tell me what the likely culprits are. I've only listed the suspect ingredients, removing those which are found in soaps that I don't have any troubles with.\n\n|**TOBS Cream**^[1] |**Mitchell's Wool Fat**|**LASSC Bay Rum**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Myristic Acid|Hexyl Cinnamal|Pimenta Racemosa Essential Oil|\n|Triethanolamine|Hydroxycitronellal|Dark Rum|\n|Methylchloroisothizolinone|Lanolin|Balsam Tolu Essential Oil|\n||Sodium Cluconate|Clary Sage Essential Oil|\n||Magnesium Sulphate|Opopanax Essential Oil|\n|||Ho Wood Essential Oil|\n\n^([1] I've tried Avocado, Grapefruit, and St. James scents)\n\nBy far the worst were the TOBS creams. These caused a rash right across my face which lasted a good 12 hours. The MWF and LASSC resulted in much milder reactions, and I still shave with these from time to time as the lather they produce is worth the irritation in my opinion.\n\nMy primary suspect with the MWF is the Lanolin, as I've read here and elsewhere that some people are sensitive to it. This ingredient is missing from the others though, and I don't know which of their ingredients are most likely to cause problems.\n\nFor reference, the soaps I've used without issue are two scents by PannaCrema, Tabac soap and Proraso Red Cream.",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/y3aFtkGdwWM)\n\nThe Goodfellas' Smile ([https://www.rasoigoodfellas.com/en/](https://www.rasoigoodfellas.com/en/)) is a new line of Italian artisan shaving soap and men’s grooming products. The artisan is focused on using unique, even bold ingredients in order to provide soap bases that the world has never seen. This iteration features two ingredients that the company claims have never been used; Blackcurrant oil and Mare’s Milk. In addition to ordering direct, you can also source The Goodfellas' Smile soaps at West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\nRe Nero, translated to English as Black King. This fragrance features notes of; grapefruit, orange, neroli, black pepper, pelargonium, patchouli and cedar wood. The resulting accord is a spicy, citrusy topped affair with an earthy, smoky backbone. This is a classic men’s fragrance that is inoffensive and well suited for year round use. This smells alot to me like Terre D’Hermes. Mrs. Ruds is loves this scent because of its similarities to the aforementioned fragrance.. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the puck and remains this way once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Declaration Grooming Trismegistus as a similar scent profile.\n\nThe Goodfellas' Smile uses a unique soap formula consisting of: AQUA (WATER), STEARIC ACID, COCONUT OIL, RIBES NIGRUM SEED OIL, EQUAE LAC, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, PARFUM, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, HYDROXICITRONELLAL, LIMONENE, HEXYL CINNAMAL, CITRONELLOL. The soap is soft, but not as soft as a croap or cream. This makes loading easy, but overloading a potential. The soap is not overly thirsty, but handles hydration easily. The lather when dialed in has a creamy, milky feel that has the consistency of sour cream. Slickness with regard to primary variant is very good, whereas residual slickness is only good. Post shave is a definitive very good. After it is rinsed away, there is a residual feeling of softness, likely attributed to the Mare’s milk. Overall, this is an nice soap with a unique use of ingredients. Given the experience I have had with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 86. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest Lather Bros.. \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - The Goodfellas' Smile Re Nero (loaner)\n* Brush - Omega #10098 (purchased)\n* Razor -Corvette 1965 (gift)\n* Post - Barrister and Mann Nordost (purchased)",

I use it in my night routine after I was my face with water or with Eucerin ph5 wash bar/ syndet. I do have sensitive skin that hates fragrance in most of the products. I recommend you to try this product by pouring it directly on your face or problematic areas or applying it in your palm and tapping it in with your fingers. When I use cotton pads in general my face gets red. So with this product, I decided to not use them too even if they recommend it so. The product isn't too harsh nor too light. After the application my face isn't stinging nor red. \n\nThis exfoliating toner has a really high efficiency when it comes to vanishing pimples that just started to form (when you feel a tiny bump forming under your skin or a bit of light stinging and redness before the pimple appears). Apply it in this time and it will help a lot, the pimple will dissappear without forming a head or anything similar. At least this is how it  works for me. \n\nAfter the toner, I use Bionike defence aqua spray. Followed by Cosrx Snail mucin essence / Vichy mineral 89 probiotic fractions serum and last Uriage Bariederm Cica cream. Don't make that mistake and use nothing moisturizing after you apply an exfoliating product on your face. Make sure that the essence, serum or moisturizer that you apply after contains no acids but only ingredients that help your skin barrier.\n\nEdit: spelling and additional information",

Every time I put it on, I can't stop huffing my nails, and I'd absolutely love a perfume with a similar vibe for everyday wear. I think the notes are fruity/floral. It's delicate, clean, and no-fuss. It smells like the universally pleasant smell after you wash your hair with many popular drug store shampoos.\n\n**Can anyone recommend perfumes that smell similar? Cruelty-free brands are preferred.**\n\nHere are some scents in my collection that have a similar vibe to what I'm looking for:\n\n* Fine'ry: Flower bed\n* Floral Street: Sweet almond blossom\n\nHere's the ingredient list in the Essie cuticle oil: Runus armeniaca kernel oil / apricot kernel oil, simmondsia chinensis seed oil / jojoba seed oil, tocopheryl acetate, parfum / fragrance, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, hexyl cinnamal, helianthus annuus seed oil / sunflower seed oil, benzyl alcohol, ci 75120 / annatto, limonene, tocopherol.\n\nEdit: Budget isn't a huge factor since I always buy decants first and luckily prefer 10 mL travel bottles to full-sized :)\n\n# Edit 2: I FOUND IT!\n\n**Osmanthe Liu Yuan by Le Jardin Retrouvé**.  I love the invigorating shampoo-y apricot notes, as well as the added depth and dare I say sexiness from the jasmine and leather notes. I'm normally not a patchouli fan, but it's extremely subtle in this. It just adds to the warm, rich undertones. You can order small 2ml samples directly from their website for \\~$5 USD.\n\nHere are the fragrance descriptions from the website:\n\n* \"You stroll along the galleries of this millenium garden, savouring the different landscapes that reveal themselves to you as you move forward. You approach the water and encounter upright rocks with evocative shapes. On one of them stands a precious bottle. When you open it, a scent escapes.

    "body": "Hair Care History:  \nI have been using low-sulfate silicone-free shower gels as shampoo for a couple of months already while not using any conditioner. I only restarted using conditioner last Tuesday, because I finally found a 'cone-free conditioner. I can go almost a week without needing to wash my hair, is that a good sign?   \nMy sister has been using high-sulfate shampoos containing a bunch of 'cones, occasionally shampoos containing keratin as well, and accompanying conditioners. I think she might need a few more shampoo washes to get out all of the build-up out of her hair, but I'd love some advice here!  \n  \nHair Properties:  \nI was born with a full head of wavy/soft curl hair and have had waves and/or brushed out curls ever since my hair was long enough to be brushed. I always thought my hair was super frizzy, because it looked so unkempt after all the brushing I did. I found a kind of routine to keep it manageable: brushing while it was still damp after a shower would help form flatter and larger waves, so it would stay closer to my head.  \nI think my curl pattern right now is about 2b, but I think I might have some 2c potential, looking at some of my new-found curls. My hair is somewhere between medium and fine. The strands are somewhat thin, but they aren't brittle and my hair holds shape pretty well if I don't mess with it. I don't think it's very porous. I did the [Slip'n'Slide test](http://www.naturallycurly.com/texture-typing/hair-porosity) and that went about as smoothly going up as going down. My hair is medium-long, going a bit past shoulder length.  \nMy sister was born with curly hair, but has lost those curls by constantly brushing them out. She has what I think are a lot of flyaways on the top of her head, probably in part caused by curl-unfriendly hair cutting techniques. My sister has had her hair thinned out in the past, which I think is mostly cutting certain strands of hair shorter than others with the goal to remove volume. But I think in her case it had an opposite effect, the shortest hairs have the most curl and now they stand away from her head. What kind of styling product would she need to deal with these flyaways? There could also be some frizz involved.  \nMy sister's curl pattern is closer to 3a/b if you give her hair a chance to curl. Before CG it looked more like 2a. Her hair likes to form medium-sized ringlets. I think her hair is somewhat coarse, it is very thick and she has a lot of hair. Her hair holds shape better than mine, if she twists her hair into a ringlet with her fingers it will stay in that shape for hours. Her hair is very long, slightly past bra band length. Her hair feels more porous than mine doing the same test, but I’m not sure how to distinguish between medium and high porosity. Her hair is very dry. She has a lot of split ends and is probably in desperate need of a hair cut, but I'm not sure if that's wise to do now that we're adjusting our routines. Advice?  \n  \nCurrent Routine:  \n*Shampoo * : Sanex Advanced Dermo Repair (this is technically a shower gel)  \nIngredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Chloride, Glyceryl Oleate, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Polyquaternium-7, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Zinc Sulfate, Benzoic Acid.   \n*Conditioner * : Argan Care conditioner  \nIngredients: Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool.  \nI’m planning on running all these ingredients through the ingredient list of Tightly Curly, but if there’s something in these products that shouldn’t be in our hair, please let me know!  \n  \nWe used these products on Tuesday, combed our hair with a wide tooth comb after applying a lot of conditioner. Afterwards plopping it with a T-shirt and sleeping with our hair up in pineapple.  \n  \nI have also attempted  a deep treatment using 100% pure coconut oil on Wednesday. After application with a hair paint brush (is there a specific name for these things?) we let it sit under a shower cap and towel for an hour, then applied a bunch of conditioner and combed it through. Then rinsing it out in the shower using shampoo and conditioner, combed again. My sister plopped for 30-60 minutes, I think? And slept with a pineapple. I showered really late, so I slept with T-shirt plopping overnight (only 6,5 hours of sleep).  \n  \nResults?:  \nIt’s kinda hard to say what product did what, but this method is really working for me so far. Having curls is an immediate boost of confidence for me, because it feels like my hair is finally starting to look how it’s supposed to look. The problem is that I’m constantly playing with my curls. I’ll twist them around my fingers, or pull on them to see them bounce. I think I lost quite some definition today because of this. Is there any way to get some of this definition back for second-day curls? Would it help if I scrunch in some water and/or conditioner and/or coconut oil?  \nMy sister had some mixed results. She has more wavish curls, but her hair came out very greasy on Thursday morning. I think she might not have rinsed everything out properly (long hair is a lot of hair), but I was also thinking about some other causes: Is this because of previous buildup? Should she attempt co-washing about every other day until it improves? It seems that washing with the shampoo could be a little harsh to do it so often, but it might be more effective?  \n  \nI would also like to have some advice on dealing with the weather. We live in the Netherlands and basically go everywhere by bicycle, so our hair is exposed to rain, fog and humidity quite often. My hair will attract the moisture and frizz. I’m not sure how much my sister’s hair is affected by it, because I find it difficult to distinguish frizz from curly flyaways. Are there any styling products we could use to help deal with this?  \n  \n[Pics!]( http://imgur.com/a/8Rnpj)  \n  \nAnd my final question!: How are we doing so far?  \n  \nTL;DR: Just started CG.  \nMy hair: medium-long, medium-fine, low-porosity, 2b-ish curls. How can I hold on to curl definition for 2nd day curls or bring the definition back? How can I combat weather-induced frizz?  \nMy sister’s hair: long and thick, coarse, more porous, 3a/b? curls. Only recently stopped using silicones and sulfates, how to ease the transition. Possibly still has some build-up, attempt co-washing more often? Has a lot of flyaways and probably also some frizz, advice on styling product? Needs a haircut, do it now or wait for routine to set in?  \nWe live in the Netherlands and this will influence product options available to us.  \n  \nSorry for the long post, I just wanted to share my excitement!",

        "body": "I agree with the previous poster, shower gel isn't shampoo, and it has a very harsh sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate. You should probably invest in a few restorative products, like a deep conditioner and protein treatment. Also, be careful with oils. They can be a wonderful thing, but can easily weigh down your hair, especially if you're low-porosity. \n\nFrizz has always been a problem of mine, and there's not that much to do other than use products based on dew points(Link in sidebar) and use gel. \n\nWhen you're just starting out, it will take time for your hair to adjust. I know this seems like a lot of terminology and work, but just keep trying new things, read the posts on naturallycurly.com and you'll get the hang of it in no time.",

    "body": "This is an unusual rant relative to the other stuff in the subreddit, but I feel like I need to make a stand and I might as well make a stand somewhere where I can actually discuss this with other people and see what their opinions are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's drop some wisdom here because I've studied my ass off in science, earning a full scholarship for high school and, from second year onward, taking at least three units each of Biology, Physics, Chemistry, and the associated mathematics. I'm sick and tired of Natural ideologues just hand-waving away all our scientific progress under the rash statement that \"Bah, you fools just made that in a lab. My mountain juice is better than anything human dedication and effort can produce.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First, the premise of my argument.**\n\n \\- Can we all agree that the universe we live in behaves predictably in accordance with certain patterns? For example, a positively-charged particle will attract negatively-charged particles.\n\n \\- This does not mean \"scientists made that law up.\" Scientists create hypotheses (Guesses) about the patterns mentioned above. Specifically, they guess what the pattern is. If the guess is proved right by a significant amount of experiments (testing their guesses) then AND ONLY THEN does it move from a Hypothesis to a Theory. When a Theory has been proven by a very, very large amount of evidence, THEN AND ONLY THEN does it become a Law, which means that scientists have tested this guess again and again in every conceivable condition, and they are practically certain that this is the way the universe behaves. There are not that many Laws relative to theories and hypotheses because the rules of science state that you have to hold this procedure to THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARD OF QUALITY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Next, the argument I wish to refute.**\n\n*\"Natural products are always better than synthetic products because they come from The Earth and thus are safer for humans.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am gonna refute this argument: I will make the statement that \"Natural products cannot be safer for consumption by humans 100% of the time.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's just take the example of soap because there is such a wide gap between - off the top of my head - natural honey propolis soap and synthetic detergents like the Dove white bar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best case for the \"Natural is better\" argument, stated scientifically, is as follows:\n\n\"Natural products contain chemical compounds that will do less harm to the human body as opposed to the ingredients in synthetic compounds.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe substance itself will only affect the organism via chemical reaction. In other words, the soap and the human only interact chemically. There's not much physics involved in how soap will affect humans, health-wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's analyze that statement. What, exactly is in natural products? Organic chemical compounds are complicated (I took three units of Org Chem and loved it the way a boxer loves going 12 rounds: I loved the struggle.) and sometimes hard to identify. Some of these ingredients are not verified to be safe for human consumption, and indeed some chemicals may be harmful to us.\n\n \\- For example, honey propolis is bee saliva mixed with beeswax mixed with material the bees have gathered from sap, tree buds, and other botanical sources. These are typically created by someone with a bee farm in a grove somewhere. They don't have 100% control over the conditions of the surrounding flora, which affects the bees. What if the bee has infected saliva? What if the trees around the beehives were of different species, would that affect the soap? What if a few bees have a mutation that causes them to produce propolis that doesn't hold its shape? Will propolis produced in the winter be different from propolis produced in the spring? What if this year was especially warm and dry, will that affect the bees? The surrounding vegetation? What if the beehives on the hill produce different kinds of propolis than the beehives next to the river, will they be sold as the same honey propolis soap? All these things are tangled in the infinite complexity of nature. To tie all these questions up: **If the ingredients of the product change even a little bit due to the natural vagaries of nature, will the product still be beneficial for people?** Likely yes, but it's also ENTIRELY POSSIBLE that a small impurity in a batch will render a soap irritating and drying where it used to be moisturizing, or even render the entire thing useless.\n\n \\- What is included in Dove White bar? I grabbed this off their website. Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Aqua, Sodium Isethionate, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Glycerin, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Zinc Oxide, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Alumina, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Alcohol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool,  CI 77891\n\nIs it safe for humans? I personally don't know, but I know we have agencies breathing down the necks of these pharmaceutical companies and there are strict rules governing whether or not these chemicals can be used on humans. These have been verified as typically non-harmless to humans. Each compound on that list is characterized according to its use, makeup, and behavior. You can google these things. Lauric Acid produced in a chemical plant in Germany will be THE SAME as Lauric Acid produced in a chemical plant in Saudi Arabia. If the German formula was off by a couple of atoms, they wouldn't be able to classify it as Lauric Acid: It would be something different. (Fun Fact: This is how some athletes get around performance enhancing drug prohibitions: If you change a couple of atoms in the right way, the effect of the chemical remains unchanged, but the identity of the chemical is - for all scientific intents and purposes - completely distinct from the original.) That means EVERY BAR of EVERY BATCH of Dove White Bar made using this formula will be EXACTLY THE SAME and will have EXACTLY THE SAME effect on a specific person. The behavior of the chemical mixture is predictable, and has been determined by a competent agency (The FDA?) to be typically harmless for humans. If a product fails this last criterion, it is typically not put out for sale because it's UNSAFE for people and thus never sees the light of day. If the FDA discovers that two usually safe ingredients interact in a way that harms a person when the product is used, guess what? They have that product pulled so it doesn't hurt people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we have natural products whose ingredients vary from batch to batch and are at the whim of the infinite, unimaginable complexity of the universe versus synthetic compounds which are clearly defined and characterized, behave predictably in the conditions they are designed to be used in, and have been verified to have a specific set of effects on a human organism, all of which have been determined by the ingredients used in these products to be safe for human use by a competent overseeing organization which is screening all these products and removing all harmful ingredients and chemicals as soon as they are discovered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow then do you make the case that Natural is Better 100% of the time? You can literally design these substances - almost atom by atom - to SPECIFICALLY only be beneficial to humans. Do not dismiss science out of hand. Always have a reason to make any statement.",

        "body": "You'll probably disagree with me, but I just trust natural things a bit more. Provided they have been sourced responsibly and all that. I feel they are more likely to cause less long term harm than something made in a laboratory. Even if something is made in a laboratory and tested, there is chance we learn something else about it down the road that is actually harmful. Like with aspirin. It's a synthetic derivative meant to be like the natural forms of aspirin you get from Willow trees and the like. It was shown to be safe and was even touted under the whole \"an aspirin a day keeps the doctor away\" but years later they found out that healthy people could actually be harming themselves by taking it daily. I also sort of view it like juice. Orange juice with pulp is better than no pulp because the fiber and extra nutrition from pulp helps you break down the sugar better. No pulp means your really just drinking sugar. I think lab created synthetics are probably fine, but natural ones that include the other things with the one you want might be more beneficial. That and natural ones generally help the native people who knew of the drug first to profit from it for their knowledge. I really frown on drug companies that find the natural form and then make their own to keep profits for themselves, and the book Tales of the Shaman's Apprentice talks about that a lot. Written in 1993 and is nonfiction it's about a man studying medical plants in tribes that are still pretty untouched by society. Definitely a good read.",

Though, I guess if people are using clarifying shampoos, I should have guessed there would be conditioner...\n\nIngredients-\n\n* Water,\n* Cetyl Alcohol,\n* Stearalkonium Chloride,\n* Cetrimonium Chloride,\n* Fragrance,\n* Glyceryl Stearate,\n* DMDM Hydantoin,\n* Hydrolyzed Collagen,\n* Benzyl Salicylate,\n* Disodium EDTA,\n* Butylphenyl Methylpropional,\n* Linalool,\n* Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde,\n* Benzyl Benzoate,\n* Hexyl Cinnamal,\n* Limonene,\n* Citronellol,\n* Yellow 5 (Cl 19140),\n* Polysorbate 20,\n* Blue 1 (Cl 42090),\n* Propylene Glycol,\n* Stearyl Alcohol,\n* Steareth-21,\n* Tocopheryl Acetate,\n* Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract,\n* Panthenol,\n* Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Extract,\n* Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Peel Extract,\n* Ascorbic Acid,\n* Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract,\n* Niacinamide Biotin\n\n**tl;dr** Is co-washing with this going to be harsh since it's clarifying? Or, should it do nicely?",

Several brands break down the main larger fragrance molecules as you mention (linalool, etc). \n\n\nThis may be of interest: https://www.gcimagazine.com/brands-products/fragrance-home/article/21849601/inci-name-fragrance (this is from an industry group, discussing some consequences of gas chromatography specifically re: the label ‘fragrance’ in ingredient list)\n\n\nNow, there is tension between a ‘wrapper name’ and what the ingredient is made of. Here is a non-fragrance example: Baicapil. The product may have Baicapil ( brand name) and you as consumer may need to figure out that\n“Glycine Soja Germ Extract (and) Triticum Vulgare Germ Extract (and) Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract (and) Sodium Benzoate (and) Gluconolactone (and) Calcium Gluconate (and) Arginine (and) Lactic Acid (and) Propanediol in the list is Baicapil. The other side of this is: if the ingredients contain this list above, does this automatically mean the product has Baicapil in it?\n\n\nA different facet is “what do we call something so that it is useful to consumers?  Taking hexyl cinnamal as example, is that enough? Or should it be hexyl cinnamaldehyde? Or ‘fragrance in part from chamomile’ or some such?\n\n\nA PS: listing organic fragrances would be a lawsuit hell for companies if done by sub-component. There are differences in subcomponents based on growth location, environment, year…. Keeping any list on the product bottle would open companies to lawsuits.",

        "body": "All soap requires the same 3 things- water (to dissolve lye),lye and fat. For lye there's 2 to choose from-Potassium Hydroxide is what gives those soaps a softer final product, and Sodium Hydroxide which makes a harder soap. For your fats there's tons to choose from, but over the years soapers have figured out Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid impart the qualities that shavers desire, a smooth, dense, creamy lather. Tallow and butters like Kokum, Mango seed have the most stearic acid, however straight stearic acid (which is 99% of the time actually a 50/50 mix of stearic and palmitic acid) has tons of benefits in immediately raising the Stearic/palmitic numbers and allowing for soapers to add other beneficial ingredients (like shea and other exotic fats) without sacrificing the qualities we value . Coconut oil (cocos nucifera) is ubiquitous for its bubble formation, it doesn't take a bunch, especially for shave soap. Too much and it can be drying or stripping on your skin which is why it's always further down from anything containing stearic acid.\n\nI'd say you're probably allergic or sensitive to a fragrance, maybe all of them.\n\n  \nI'm surprised sodium cocoate is the number 1 ingredient in SV, a famously excellent soap. I never would have guessed it to be honest, as a soaper I try to limit the coconut oil to the lowest I can.",

So, do you think that this serum is actually a good idea?\n\nIngredients list:\nAqua (Water), Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Propylene Glycol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Citrus Aurantifolia Extract, Chelidonium Majus Extract, Cucumis Sativus Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Extract, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Parfum (Fragrance), Xanthan Gum, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopenta Siloxane, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Geranol, Hydroxycitronellal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Linalool. \n\nBased on it, do you think it might do my dull, thick, oily, acne-prone skin any good?",

It was the only thing that seemed to work, but I was still having problems. I started educating myself and got a bit discouraged because of the very high alcohol content and I stopped using it. I improved my routine, introduced BHA etc. and it all got better, but one time my face was breaking out pretty badly again and I found this little tube in my bathroom... Quite desperate, I applied the gel in the evening and, well, the next morning my face was *so much better*. All the spots shrunk, nothing new came out. A week later and my skin is doing great, better than in a looong while.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you have access to it and your skin is not particularly dry or sensitive to alcohol, and you struggle with acne - give it a go. Or probably any other product that contains witch hazel extract.\n\nImproving my skincare overall helped a lot, but at this moment, if I was to point out one product that makes the biggest difference, hands down, it would be this gel.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Ingredients: Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Propylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Parfum, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, Linalool, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Cl 42090*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit:\n[This is the product I'm talking about](http://www.boots.com/en/Witch-Blemish-Gel-35ml_982949/)",

        "body": "The company is correct.  \n\nThe phtyokeratin (hydrolyzed wheat protein) and silk protein is sort of like a rope with magnets woven in.  The \"magnets\" are like a perfect \"key\" shape to fit into the perfect \"lock\" hole in your hair.  We would normally only need 0.1-0.2% protein to achieve this, because that's the practical limit of how much we can put into the bottle, but also anymore just goes down the drain.\n\nAnalogy: your hair is like a piece of fuzzy rope covered in armor plating.  There are holes in that armor and the fuzz pokes through almost like Velcro.  The protein binds to the rope that isn't covered by armor.  When it dries that protein turns into new armor.  Your hair strand is now coated in a tough film that is resistant to oil.\n\nIt doesn't work for every type of hair.  It works best for fine, limp hair.  It doesn't work as well for kinky or stiff hair.\n\nThe fixatives such as formaldehyde do different chemistry on hair.  The purpose of those is to react with disulfide bonds in hair.  You don't want a fixative in a product with protein.  It's going to react in the bottle and you will destroy the benefits of either.\n\nAnalogy: take my fuzzy rope covered in armor.  Put cement on the ropey bits.  It's going to fix in place.",

The use of \"...hydrolyzed protein which we fix with formaļdehyde\" suggests that during the treatment (heat?) of the hair, there is an equilibrium between HCHO-X-linked protein, and HCHO-X-linked keratin (hair). These treatments are generally preceded by a reduction step (R-S-S-R') reduction, 'relaxing' the hair fiber. This is followed by the X-linker, in this case HCHO released by the X-linked protein in the product.\n\nI was involved in the assessment and banning of the original formaldehyde-containing product from this company where I live. Really dangerous for hairdressers, and I wonder how much free formaldehyde is released during application?",

For example Xanthan Gum is used in concentrations between 0.5% and 2%, and the Ascorbyl Glucoside (Vitamin C derivative) comes after that. It might be a good moisturizer I guess, but again I wouldn't count on the Vitamin C to do anything and the Vitamin E is essentially a preservative in this context.\n\nSorry to be so cynical.",

Availability (particularly in the United States) is still rather limited, but I was lucky enough to score a tub from T&H’s North American distributor.\n\nT&H describes the Aplsey scent as *“…a refined blend of smouldering woods accentuated by light citrus notes.... [W]oody vertivert are lifted with a refreshing essence of grapefruit and are accentuated by notes of pepper, while its heart of cedar- wood and patchouli, which has been enriched by sensual notes of musk…”*\n\nI get mostly grapefruit and cedar to my nose (though I admittedly have a poor sense of smell).  The strength of the scent is moderately strong out of the tub, softening pleasantly on my face.  I find it lingers well during the shave but does not persist for very long afterward.\n\nCompared to the rest of the T&H shaving cream line I think Apsley performs a bit better, particularly in the “cushioning” department.    I find the over-all performance of the Apsley shaving cream excellent.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Myristic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Acid, Glycerin, Parfum, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hydroxide, Mthylparaben, Parpylparaben, Limonene, Hydroxycitronellal, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional\n\nFull text with pic and links [HERE](http://sharpologist.com/2017/04/truefitt-hill-apsley-review.html).\n",

I've been getting 10 (2+ pass shaves)!\r\n\r\nBy the way, even though T&H creams are not cheap, they do give you a big tub (6.7oz/190g)  I worked out the cost per oz of various \"premium\" shaving creams available from a local shave shop, and on a per oz basis, they've quite reasonable. Even Apsley, at its higher than T&H norm price, still comes in far more economical on this basis than many others.",

It’s just that the effects are usually not as durable without formaldehyde. \n\nMany of the ingredients are surfactants, emulsifiers, and oils that likely help the reshaped hair resist ambient humidity.",

    "body": "So, to start things off: I have curly, low-porosity hair that's on the coarse side, and although I love my curls at times I've been really wanting to experiment with doing a silk press. Of course, I want to make sure I won't be damaging my hair in the process or ruining my curls, so I've been doing my research and looking around for my holy grail heat-protectant - one that can tolerate high-heat (around 425 F), has water-soluble silicones, no proteins, and no drying alcohols. I've already found a heat-protectant that I plan on trying soon (Discover Found Avocado Oil Heat Protectant Spray), however I'm still looking for a hydrating, heat-protectant leave-in conditioner to use prior to blow-drying. It's been a long search, and although I haven't found the perfect product I think I've come close enough with some of these. I'm open to some exceptions, such as using Amodimethicone because from my understanding it creates a thin film over the hair, doesn't build on top of itself, and mainly builds in damaged areas in the cuticle. Proteins are something I'd highly prefer to avoid as my hair seems to like getting as much moisture as it can get, but in really small quantities I may be fine. Also trying my best to avoid drying alcohols. So with all that in mind, I'd love to get some second-opinions on these products and which would be the best fit for what I'm looking for. I've left some notes on these, so I hope that won't confuse anyone lol. Any other product suggestions would be highly appreciated.

Once it stays slick, leave it in as you soap up and wash the rest of your body, or shave your face.\n\n\nI think you should find a cheaper conditioner with more alcohol and less oils.

Eventually, I found one that was terrible and one that was great.\n\nI tried:\n\n**1) AloeLife skin gel.**\n*Ingredients: Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Barbadensis Juice Concentrate, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Allantoin, Phospholipid, Retinal (Vit. A), Panthenol, Niacinamide, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vit. C), Tocopherol Acetate (Vit. E), Gluconolactone, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Benzoate & Potassium Sorbate (food grade preservatices).*\n\nCame for the niacinamide, stayed for the Nothing. The texture was awful - it stuck to itself while wet and even more when dry, to the point of pilling up and forming scales and strings on my face. It also ended up making me feel drier than when I started, which is the opposite of what I wanted here. I ended up mixing tiny amounts of it into my facial oil, which was still pretty useless. The packaging was upsetting too - after squeezing it out, immediately separating it from the nozzle was very important, otherwise the suction of the bottle would pull it back in (and presumably contaminate the rest of it).\n\n**2) Alba botanica very emollient after sun 98% aloe vera gel**\n*Ingredients:  Aloe barbadensis leaf juice(1), aqua (water), glycerin, lactobacillus/arundinaria gigantea ferment filtrate, caesalpinia spinosa gum, camilla sinensis leaf extract(1), ginkgo biloba leaf extract(1), leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, pyrus malus (apple) fruit extract, cananga odarata flower oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, alcohol(1), gluconolactone, phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, terpineol, triethylcitrate, hexyl cinnamal. (1)Certified Organic Ingredient.*\n\nFigured I could deal with a 1% less aloe vera content. Came for the random ferments in there, stayed for the actual moisturizing. The packaging isn't great just because this is super runny - it would be a lot more suited to a pump of some kind. But it is very soothing and moisturizing, and I've been using it with a small amount of my oils as my main moisturizer.  A much better product (and a much cheaper one at the same time!)",

The first fragrance that we're trying to adapt is Dior Jadore. It's a special fragrance for my wife because it's the perfume that she wore on our wedding day.

But it's not Jadore. Jadore has a warm, soapy undertone that I haven't gotten close to recreating. Adding more Alpha Ionone, Cinnamyl Alcohol, and Farnesol makes it better, but I'm still missing that warm soapiness.\n\nDoes anybody know what I might be missing? Does Dior not post a full list of fragrance ingredients? One ingredient that I don't have is Benzyl Benzoate. It was pretty far down on the ingredients list, and I thought I could make it work using Benzyl Salicylate as the only fixative. I'm still struggling to tell what the Benzyl Salicylate is doing, but did I leave out a key ingredient?",

        "body": ">Does Dior not post a full list of fragrance ingredients?\n\nNo; that is kept *extremely* secret.\n\n>Dior also posted an ingredients list on their website\n\nThat is not an ingredients list; that is a legally-required disclosure of possible allergens.  I mean...they're all used in the product, yes, but it's nearly useless in terms of trying to reproduce it.\n\nFor example, the presence limonene & linalool on that list might mean that they're part of the formula.  Or maybe they're not, and they used bergamot EO.  Or maybe they didn't, but they used lemon EO, which would also explain the citral, except maybe the citral came from a citral/MA schiff base.  It really doesn't give you any leads at all, and the wild goose chases only multiply as the list gets longer and the number of possibilities explodes.\n\n> It was pretty far down on the ingredients list\n\nMaterials present at less than 1% of the final product may be listed in any order.  As *many* materials in a fragrance will be at those levels, order is mostly useless to determine relative amounts used.",

I'm using [Nivea SPF 50 Sun Lotion](http://www.boots.com/en/Nivea-Sun-Moisturising-Sun-Spray-SPF50-200ml_22315/) and I've been reading a lot about various harmful chemicals that can be contained in sunscreen such as BPA. \n\nThe Nivea sunscreen I'm using has this as its list of ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Octocrylene, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Alcohol Denat., Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Homosalate, Titanium Dioxide, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonate, Methylpropanediol, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Limonene, Linalool, Benzyl Benzoate, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Eugenol, Citronellol, Coumarin, Benzyl Alcohol, Parfum\n\nDoing my own research I couldn't find anything that I should be particularly concerned about except from the Parfum, however, I am new so was hoping you guys could take a glance over the ingredients and let me know if theres anything harmful in there.\n\nEdit - Formatting\n",

Physical/ all mineral sunscreen is usually recommended for those with a damaged skin barrier or sensitive conditions like rosacea or eczema/ dermatitis.\n\n*Alcohol denat* is a potential irritant, penetration enhancer, dehydrates the skin and it is pretty high up the ingredients list.\n\n*\"Limonene, Linalool, Benzyl Benzoate, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde (Lyral), Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional (Lilial), Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Eugenol, Citronellol, Coumarin, Benzyl Alcohol.\"*\n\nMany of the above are fragrant components of essential oils that are known irritants/ allergens so have to be [labelled separately in the EU] (http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/perfume-allergies/en/index.htm). Some become even more allergenic when oxidised. Benzyl alcohol is also used as a preservative tho. I really don't like to see these fragrance ingredients alongside the alcohol since it is a penetration enhancer.\n\nIf you are in the UK you may not even need sunscreen right now, the UV index is very low (sunscreen is recommended whenever the UV index is 3+, tho you need to be more vigilant when using photosensitising actives). Sprays can make it very difficult to apply the recommended amount, which is *at least* half a teaspoon for face and neck, more for decollete.\n\nDo join us on /r/skincareaddictionUK/, check out our sidebar and Wiki.",

I have a lot of serum foundations, and some of them contain both water and cyclopentasiloxane. The Temptu foundation adjuster is silicone-based, whereas the Kett foundation adjuster is water-based.

For the more water based foundations, you might want to use more Kett than Temptu when trying out a combination of both, but it's hard to say because we don't know the actual proportions of water:silicones.\n\nAlso, are you using enough sunscreen? Most people drastically under apply, which drastically affects its efficacy. You can try reapplying more often too, every 2hr is recommended.",

Curlscan not only tells you whether or not it’s CG, but also lists hot-button ingredients like aloe, coconut, protein, etc, that are helpful for finding products with ingredients you like, and without the ones you don’t. The advanced search on curlscan is also super cool; you select the type of product you want (conditioner, styler, leave in, etc), and you can select what ingredients you want, and which ones you’re trying to avoid\n\nEdit; curlscan’s downfall is that it does not have all products in its database. This is where curlsbot’s ingredient-based setup is helpful; it doesn’t need info on every product out there, just what ingredients aren’t CG",

Symptoms include eyes turning very red and swelling slightly, left more then right, mild nasal congestion, headaches. The nasal congestion and headaches are short lived, after I am no longer exposed 24 hours, however my biggest issue is my eyes stay red and swollen for 1-2 WEEKS.\n\nThis is affecting my professional life because I am occasionally mistaken for being high on marijuana, and I need to communicate face to face with patients, families, and nurses.\n\nIf I am exposed to those air fresheners daily the redness will not go away without prescription steroid eye drops from my ophthalmologist. Unfortunately the drops can only be used for short term flair ups use because long term use can cause glaucoma and cataracts. I had extensive testing done including dilation, was told my eyes are healthy internally, and that the problem is only on the exterior part of the eyes, in their opinion likely an allergy.   \n\nI recently moved and now I am able to fully control my home environment, but everywhere else I go there is not much I can do. I can't demand everyone, everywhere I go to unplug all their air fresheners and to not spray Febreze, and It's not possible to live isolated in a bubble. \n\nOral antihistamines don't do anything short term, so I'm not sure if they help at all. Antihistamine eye drops help for 3 hours max (pataday 1x a day) but then there appears to be a rebound around 12-24 hours later and the redness gets worse then it originally was. Allergist recommended Flonase but it didn't help my eye at all. \n\nThe allergist did a skin test and prick test with the Febreze and said that I'm not allergic to it, so It's likely \"non allergic rhinitis\" to fragrances in general. The Febreze says \"contains allergens\" on the label, so I am skeptical that there isn't more to this with reaction to my eyes instead of my skin.\n\nI used AI to fetch and compare the two air fresheners that I reacted to, the ingredient list of both, and discovered that they shared some ingredients which are known allergens and skin irritants. \n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAI response:\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the ingredients for Air Wick’s Bright Citrus Splash and Febreze’s Lavender air freshener, along with the shared ingredients between the two:\n\n# Air Wick Bright Citrus Splash Ingredients\n\n* Fragrance (including various natural and synthetic components)\n* d-Limonene\n* Alpha-isomethyl ionone\n* Geraniol\n* Linalool\n* Eugenol\n* Benzyl salicylate\n* Citronellol\n* Hexyl cinnamal\n\n# Febreze Lavender Air Freshener Ingredients\n\n* Fragrance (proprietary blend including natural and synthetic compounds)\n* Linalool\n* Hexyl cinnamal\n* Citronellol\n* Geraniol\n* Benzyl benzoate\n\n# Shared Ingredients Likely to Cause Allergies\n\nBoth products contain several common allergens. Specifically:\n\n1. **Linalool** \\- Known for its potential to cause skin irritation and allergies.\n2. **Hexyl cinnamal** \\- Associated with fragrance-related allergies.\n3. **Citronellol** \\- A common allergen in scented products.\n\nAI response end.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI've read other air freshener posts here with people being allergic to LINALOOL, so I think I'm on to something. I've also found a few more interesting ingredients worth noting from AI: \n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwhich one is more likely to cause eye allergies?\n\n# ChatGPT said:\n\nChatGPT\n\nBetween Air Wick Bright Citrus Splash and Febreze Lavender, **Air Wick Bright Citrus Splash** is likely to cause more eye allergies. This is due to its inclusion of ingredients such as **d-Limonene**, **alpha-isomethyl ionone**, and **benzyl salicylate**, all of which are known for causing respiratory and eye irritation, particularly in individuals sensitive to fragrances.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the eye-irritating potential of ingredients in each:\n\n1. **Air Wick Bright Citrus Splash**:\n   * **d-Limonene**: This compound is widely used for its citrus scent but is known to oxidize and form byproducts that irritate eyes and respiratory passages​[RBA Info](https://www.rbnainfo.com/MSDS/US/AIR%20WICK%20Freshmatic%20Automatic%20Spray%20-%20Bright%20Citrus%20Splash%20-%20US%20-%20English.pdf).\n   * **Alpha-isomethyl ionone**: Often used in floral and woody fragrances, this compound can be sensitizing and is associated with eye discomfort​[RBA Info](https://www.rbnainfo.com/MSDS/US/AIR%20WICK%20Freshmatic%20Automatic%20Spray%20-%20Bright%20Citrus%20Splash%20-%20US%20-%20English.pdf).\n   * **Benzyl Salicylate**: Commonly included for its pleasant floral scent, it is recognized as an irritant to both eyes and skin, especially in sensitive individuals​[RBA Info](https://www.rbnainfo.com/MSDS/US/AIR%20WICK%20Freshmatic%20Automatic%20Spray%20-%20Bright%20Citrus%20Splash%20-%20US%20-%20English.pdf).\n2. **Febreze Lavender**:\n   * **Linalool** and **hexyl cinnamal** are present in both products, but Febreze Lavender has a lower concentration of aggressive irritants compared to Air Wick Bright Citrus Splash. However, linalool can still cause eye irritation if it oxidizes, forming sensitizing compounds over time.\n\nGiven these ingredients, Air Wick's Bright Citrus Splash has a higher likelihood of causing eye allergies, especially for people with sensitivities to citrus-based fragrances and oxidized compounds.\n\nAI response end. \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nIs anyone else out there in a similar situation that has any tips? What type of doctor should I see next and any tests I should ask for? ",

    "body": "Greetings, fellow DE'ers\n\nI'll be going on a trip soon, so I decided to grab some cheap aftershave.\n\nIn a supermarket I found that a local brand has started producing relatively cheap aftershave tubes in travel-sized packages. Great!\n\nBut here's the problem. There are two options to choose from. One is named AFTERSHAVE BALM and the other one is named AFTERSHAVE CREAM. The AFTERSHAVE BALM is twice as expensive as the AFTERSHAVE CREAM (quantity is the same).\n\nThis is all the information I managed to find about these products:\n\n**AFTERSHAVE BALM**\n\n>Description\n>\n>DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR MEN.\n>\n>• Moisturises and soothes irritated skin after shaving.\n>• Has a gentle cooling effect.\n>• Convenient to carry on trips.\n>• Dermatologically tested.\n>\n>INGREDIENTS\n>\nAqua, Vegetable Oil, Glycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propolis, Alcohol, Menthol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xanthan Gum, Alcohol Denat., Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Parfum (Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool).\n\n**AFTERSHAVE CREAM**\n \n>Description\n>\n>Aftershave cream with propolis.

None of them have astringents, like witch hazel or alum (aluminum acetate or aluminum sulfate), or at least some chamomile. So, as far as doing what a modern aftershave should do, closing the cuts, they fail. They are basically moisturizers sold as aftershaves. You are better off with a widely available moisturizing cream or a toner, as they are cheaper and better made. \nWe got used to blindly buying whatever these companies are selling as \"aftershaves\", even if, as ingredients go, they forget the main component in an aftershave lotion, that being the astringent.",

    "body": "ETA: I figured it out. I'm having a bad reaction to Nature's Gate vitamin e oil (40,000 IU). One of the listings for it on Amazon has 30% 1-star ratings of people who had the same reaction. I wondered about this on Sunday, actually, Googled it, and found vitamin e allergic contact dermatitis, which is rare, but does happen. It's due to either the tocopheryl acetate or the pure concentration of it, not sure which, as I have other products that contain vitamin e that have not given me the same reaction. It went away before I went out of town and while I was gone because I stopped using the oil at night in favor of a different oil that I thought would treat swimmer's itch. There's also an old post over on /r/WTF of someone having a similar reaction to vitamin e. \n\nI have been fighting an allergic reaction to godknowswhat on my entire face for over a month now. I thought it was swimmer's itch, since it started when I jumped in the lake on Labor Day (burning under the eyes), or maybe a reaction to my sunscreen (Blue Lizard face), until it came back two weeks later. My skin is insanely sensitive, so I'm always very careful with what I use, always patch test, and have not used anything on my face (skincare, makeup, etc.) that I have not used for years. I have not switched hair products recently, I use free and clear laundry detergent and no fabric softener, because I am allergic to those, and fragrance-free lotion and body wash.\n\nThe initial reaction went away after two weeks and liberal application of neem oil. I spent a weekend in Chicago with my face back to normal, came back home, and the reaction started to come back under my right eye that Monday. Tuesday morning, I woke up with severe swelling of both of my eye lids, so I went and saw my primary doctor, who gave me a steroid shot and put me on a 12 day course of prednisone and said no makeup for two weeks. That was pretty miserable, but it worked...until this past Monday when I started my first day of the half pill and the swelling/itching started again. Tuesday it started to get worse, so I called my doctor, who referred me to an allergist. \n\nI saw the allergist, who put me on a 6-day course of methylprednisolone (Cadista--which has been better in terms of side effects and worked very well on the first day), said no makeup, and to stop using ALL of my current products, remove my nail polish, no hair products. She gave me a bunch of Vanicream samples to use instead, so I've been washing my face with the cleansing bar and slathering hydrocortisone, vitamin e oil, and Aquaphor all over my face. Nothing is working, I have two days of the Cadista left and my face still itches, the puffiness is still there, the redness around my eyes comes and goes. She had no insight on what it could be, other than maybe something that's getting on my hands and then I'm touching my face. I have no idea what that could be--because I normally wear quite a bit of eye makeup (that I've never reacted to), I avoid touching my eyes, and because I tend to be acne-prone, I really try to avoid touching my face except in case of when I cleanse/moisturize. \n\nThe only thing I can think of is that two spray hair products that I use both have an irritating fragrance (hexyl cinnamal) in them, and they may be getting on my face either when I use them and/or getting on my pillow case at night and then getting on my face. I've washed and swapped out my pillow case several times since this started. I am not having issues breathing at all, this is a skin reaction only. \n\nAnyone have any insights? :( I'm miserable.\n\nETA: I have a follow up appointment with the allergist at the end of November.",

Fyi, i use oil control shampoos as a counter for excessive sebum.\n\n**To start off i've noticed that some specific shampoos, f.e some H&S ones, with similar ingredients in them, tend to be more aggrevvating towards rosacea and they usually leave a flared up feeling post wash that can last, depending on how serious your rosacea is. However, they tend to be more effective towards acne (if you also have that) and dandruff.**\n\n* *Example 1-> Product: Head & Shoulders Deep Cleanse For Oily Scalp*\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Parfum, Piroctone Olamine, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-10, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Limonene, Sodium Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Citrus Limon Fruit Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, CI 42090*\n\n**Other shampoos like the le petit marseillais one** **(or gen ones that are more eco) with very different ingredients in it and missing the most well known trigger ingredients, is more friendly towards rosacea. I did notice that, post using it, my hair look more thin, shedding and thats a bit worrying. (placebo?!)**\n\n*Example 2->Product: Le Petit Marseillais w/ Thyme and White Clay*\n\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Thymus Vulgaris Extract, Kaolin, Polyquaternium-10, Glycol Distearate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n**P.S: Ingredients that can trigger rosacea flare ups, quoting AAD:**\n\n* *Alcohol*\n* *Camphor*\n* *Fragrance*\n* *Glycolic acid*\n* *Lactic acid*\n* *Menthol*\n* *Sodium lauryl sulfate (often found in shampoos)*\n* *Urea*\n\nThere's also shampoos that belong to an in between category, having slightly different ingredients in them, but i do notice that, thus far, none of them are as friendly as an eco shampoo which doesn't have the same ingredients as a H&S one, or has them in a very low percent.\n\nThis makes sense as ingredients that trigger rosacea when applied to the face straight away, can be effective when applying them to your hair/scalp which is a continuation of your face contact area. You can mitigate the consequences by avoiding shampoo run down your face/wash well post shampoo etc...\n\nYou can drop your recommendations below as well as the ingredients involved in the products you use.",
