    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

        "body": "I appreciate you taking the time to write this up and the thought and effort behind it. I will say though that there is one part you should seriously consider editing:\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nThis is very incorrect. While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

I have a question regarding\n\n\"Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\"\n\nand\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nI was first prescribed Retin-A at 18 years old. I used it on and off from age 18 to 21. I have been using it consistently (5-7 days per week) from age 21 to 25 (my current age). I now use 0.1% retin-a almost every night and a few months ago I started using TO 30% AHA + 2% BHA once a week. The AHA + BHA makes my skin really smooth and helps with SFs on my nose. It does not cause redness, dryness, or irritation for me. Could I be doing damage to my skin that I can't see? Or is it ok to use as long as I don't see or feel irritation?",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use.

Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won’t meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That’s the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won’t be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there’s a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ❤️",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

I buy cleanser and sometimes moisturizer from DT because I don’t really need actives per se from these products since I use Adapalene. I’m currently using the glow recipe watermelon moisturizer dupe which has niacinamide. I don’t know the quality of the niacinamide nor the percentage but for 1.25 I’m willing to try it since I’m not relying on it solely for an active ingredient. I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it’s a glass jar and it’s 2 oz. But it’s a very “wet” texture which I don’t like because then I can’t apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene? The packaging says not to use any other acne product so I just really haven’t really tried it but was curious if anyone knew.",

I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

    "body": "\nHey all! 👋🏻I want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

Here in EU I can't find on their website confirmation of percentage of retinaldehyde of Ystheal but I read on several pages that Ystheal= 0.05 & their triacneal contains 0.1. Think I'll buy both to compare.\n\nAnd a tip as you said LRP face wash was HG, it might be an idea to buy the 400 ml LRP toleriane next time. Have it myself and bought it for 13 euro @ farmaline.",

It‘s called Absorica Retinal and comes out straight yellow from the tube.

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

Parachute discontinued this product soon after and I was heart broken, so were my friends who became equally obsessed. BUT, they brought it back, my boyfriend discovered it for me and I immediately asked a friend of mine to get it from India (I am currently residing in UK). I was very excited to try it, the texture is same as the previous product but they have definitely changed the formulation. The scent is also very different from the discontinued product.\n\nThe new formulation is amazing and this has become my holy grail again. I would repurchase it in a heartbeat, ive struggled with fungal acne and this product is the only thing that helps me. i love it SO MUCH. it really is the best fucking product and i am so happy it is back. I will be loyal to this till the end of my life. Although, i feel the new formulation is inferior to the old one but only marginally.\n\nThis product is very cheap too, always on sale on myntra and is available everywhere, last time people struggled to find it.

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!! Paula’s Choice is having 20% this weekend (on one product) so I am contemplating trying her vitamin c serum. I will be shy on free shipping though, and not sure what else to order lol.",

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

    "body": "...and the Garnier Skinactive Rose and Aloe toners while we’re here and while they’re cheap, and the old & new formulations of the Simple Soothing toner (also contain Niacinamide).\n\nProduct pics & tests (6-image album) https://imgur.com/a/MXGnWU6 \n\n-\n\nProduct pages (don’t list ingredients, have put them on CosDNA).\n\nhttps://www.aldi.co.uk/lacura-glycerol-exfoliating-tonic/p/017688294206602\n\nhttps://www.aldi.co.uk/lacura-retinol-exfoliating-tonic/p/017688294206401\n\nhttps://www.aldi.co.uk/lacura-rose-exfoliating-tonic/p/017688293519800\n\nhttps://www.boots.com/pixi-glow-tonic-250ml-10256343\n\nhttps://www.boots.com/pixi-retinol-tonic-250ml-10256347\n\nhttps://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-tonic-250ml-10256345\n\n-\n\nhttps://www.aldi.co.uk/lacura-rose-facial-oil/p/017686293371900\n\n-\n\nhttps://www.boots.com/garnier-skin-active-naturals-rose-toner-200-ml-10229258\n\nhttps://www.boots.com/garnier-skin-active-naturals-aloe-toner-200-ml-10229259\n\n\n\n-\n\nGlycolic acid toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_276d394994.html\n\n> Aqua, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Phenoxyethanol, Allantoin, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Benzophenone-4, Disodium EDTA, Parfum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Linalool, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Caramel, CI 14700.\n\nDoesn’t appear to be reformulated, ingredients and pH are the same. The “Glycerol” product page title is a typo, as there is no glycerol in there.\n\n-\n\nRetinol & Niacinamide toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9b0a443774.html\n\n> Aqua, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Panthenol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyacetophenone, Parfum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jasminum Officinale Extract, Poloxamer 235, Retinol, Sodium Ascorbate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil, BHT, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, BHA, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Linalool, Coumarin. \n\nRetinol is quite low down but this has 5% Niacinamide, so it should be a good “lots of Niacinamide but not as hefty as 10% Niacinamide” product, replacing the Simple soothing toner which never specified the exact content but has been reformulated to have less active ingredient since I last tested it, so here are some new tests and ingredients: https://imgur.com/a/QJhFAxZ\n\n-\n\nRose & hyaluronic acid toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_65a8443777.html\n\n> Aqua, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sambucus Nigra Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Allantoin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Sodium PCA, Bisabolol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nRose oil http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8dcc443757.html\n\n> Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Parfum, Tocopherol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate.\n\nHappy to see there are no plastics or silicones in there. Like the Pixi one it’s mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, “sweet scented geranium”(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn’t sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to “not have pH” (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn’t buy the Pixi version as it’s still £17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around. Rose oil is sold out online, *might* have to be quick to get it in the store.",

    "body": "Hey so I haven't been using this long enough to give a true review, but I know a lot of you guys were curious and I think I've actually already started noticing results so I wanted to report back!! This post is heavy on the ~product analysis~ front, so if you're super not into that, skim until the 2nd to last paragraph for results lol  \n\nSo first off if you don't know about \"The Ordinary\" line, mosey over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/50fb1j/psa_we_need_to_talk_about_this_new/) to read about it!   \n\nAlright so I picked up the niacinamide serum ([$6!!](http://ordinaries.com/product/rdn-niacinamide-10pct-zinc-1pct-30ml)) and began using it twice a day on September 4, which means I'm closing in on a week of use. I have wanted to add a high-niacinamide product to my routine for a while (I was looking at 5%, which research says is most effective, but I was happy to use the 10% more like a booster and mixing into things - if anything that makes it an even BETTER value b/c it'll last even longer! haha) - for PIH and for general skin barrier function benefits. I was actually a little uncertain about the inclusion of zinc b/c the description talks about its sebum control benefits, and I actually have skin on the drier end. But if zinc PCA is anything like sodium PCA, it should be more humectant than drying, so perhaps its sebum control is more of the \"balancing\" variety....      \n\nHere are the ingredients: Aqua (Water), 10% Niacinamide, 1% Zinc PCA, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Pentylene Glycol, Carrageenan, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.   \n\n++Of note is the carrageenan, a stabilizing ingredient that is derived from algae and thus potentially comedogenic. This ingredient put me off a bit; however, we know it is less than 1%, so I decided to plow ahead with full face testing lol. If you are more acne prone or have used this ingredient with issues in the past, by all means patch test - I was just too lazy/excited :-/     \nedit to add: you will see that they post a long winded explanation/justification on the product page for the inclusion of carrageenan. it's pretty irrelevant so do ignore it lol. carrageenan is used in food as well, and there are some natural food blogs screaming about how bad it is to consume, and THAT is what Deciem is referring to. that, however, is NOT why ppl think it's comedogenic. it's potentially comedogenic b/c it's derived from algae. has nothing to do with inflammation upon consumption. so, total strawman. I think Deciem is an interesting brand but they say and do a lot of stuff that really makes me scratch my head. (recommendations against chemical exfoliants being another thing. they recommend retinoic acid but not something way gentler like BHA? ehh)       \n\nA little about my skintype: I've had mild to moderate comedonal acne for years, and had one of the biggest flareups of my life around this past January. It wasn't until a generous + rigorous use of escalating BHA products throughout July and August that I finally purged it all out and stabilized ##knock on wood## I didn't *plan on* testing ANY new products until I was certain I was in the clear. I ordered the Deciem stuff thinking I would test it in a few weeks when I was more sure.     \n\nThen I ended up doing a mask that really irritated my skin lol. I had known for a couple weeks that I was on the cusp of overexfoliation / damaged moisture barrier, but I was also like SO CLOSE to being totally done purging, so I didn't give my skin the break it probably needed. Anyway, I got some bad dermatitis in places I'm very prone to it and I cleared it out w/ Aquanil HC (a hydrocortisone based lotion cleanser), but I also wanted to speed up my overall recovery process so I could go back to using BHA :-/ I was feeling paranoid about going off for 4 days! So I decided to start testing out the niacinamide. << This paragraph just to give the context to say... my good results are at least partially due to my finally giving my skin a much-needed break from chemical exfoliation\n\nSo yeah anyway, back to the Deciem serum. It's a highly viscous serum, I posted how when I received it (SUPER rapid & free shipping, btw) it arrived super bubbly - I haven't had serums arrive like this before probably b/c I usually use waterier stuff (#ABlyfe) Also note that although it's quite thick, that's purely just the texture, it's not emollient or anything - see how the ingredients show that the only ingredient above 1% is niacinamide, it's a mostly-water product!      \n\nFor this reason, and b/c it's a super-high 10%, and also b/c I want to further dilute out the ingred I'm scared of, I mix it 1:1 with a hydrating toner or essence (I use 2 drops, which usually corresponds to more than 2 drops of a watery product b/c it's so thick!). Hada Labo lotions work well, I've also done it w/ CosRX Galactomyces and Tosowoong sparkle ampoule. I've read complaints about the PC niacinamide booster being too watery, and this definitely doesn't have that problem! I apply this twice a day at some point in my hydration steps (usually this order: wash face / galactomyces on damp skin / niacinamide / cosrx snail 96. I have tried it after the snail as well, but I think I like using it underneath a little more. nbd tho)    \n\nAnyway, in the week since I have started using the niacinamide, I have DEFINITELY noticed an improvement in my skin tone and texture. It feels softer & smoother and just generally looks a little brighter and less red (it's one of those things where you never think your skin is red but once your skin is less red you realize there IS a difference haha. I realize now I've always had a little redness in my cheeks). I started noticing these effects only a few days in, and I don't think my own skin can do that so quickly just through removal of irritants - i.e., I do think this product is responsible for at least some of the good results. My skin has also been a lot less thirsty, but I would prob attribute that benefit more to the break from BHA's. Zero noticeable effects on PIH, and I would be gobsmacked if I did have any results after 6 days! And no undue dryness from the zinc, which I was a tiny bit worried about   \nUPDATE 9/12: with each passing day I'm more and more excited by the changes in my skin. it's seriously so much happier looking and feeling. those tiny dehydration striations are gone, pores look maybe more refined? and most importantly, my skin is so much less dry, and while I first chalked this up to the lack of chem exfoliation, even after using BHA 3x in the past week my skin is still calm. fingers crossed these improvements last! I suspect I'll plateau soon, will update in one week!    \nFinal update: this gave me crazy improvement of my skin texture + tone in a few days. I stopped using it after ~2 wks b/c I started breaking out a bit and I got spooked it was the cause, though I still don't really have proof that it was (some other factors in flux at the time, such as decreased BHA usage). Since then though I've switched to DIY niacinamide stuff (I only bought the serum to tide me over until the weather was cool enough for me to order a batch of DIY ingredients - otherwise I absolutely would've given it another test run to confirm if it broke me out), which TBH hasn't given me as drastic results, but that could be entirely b/c I already improved so much already      \n\nIf you have been interested in niacinamide for a while, I think this is an awesome product to test it out. Even if you already know you love it, this is a simple and cheap product with a really high percentage! Personally I wouldn't use it full strength, and anyway it's easier to put on if you sheer it out a bit. But yeah, if anyone else has used this please chime in too!",

I have 4% azelaic acid, 0.05% tretinoin, and 4% niacinamide. I'm not sure what the azelaic acid accomplishes, but I know I want the retinoid and the niacinamide. My skin is dryish but still somewhat acne-prone, so I want to be gentle and moisturizing and loving but also kill all the zits.",

I have no connection to L’Herboflore or Beautibi, other than being an enthusiastic customer willing to hand over a lot of my money. The only things I received for writing this review are firm, bouncy skin and a sore wrist.]**\n\n**[Also, there aren't any photos because it's evening here, and there are too many shadows, but I link to some sites where you can see pictures.]**\n\nOn a trip to Taiwan last October, I sought out the L’Herboflore stand in the Taipei 101 building, eager to get my hands on some sheet masks. Much to my surprise, I discovered that L’Herboflore carries a lot of products that aren’t sheet masks, such as cleansers, a toner, eye cream, exfoliating gel, moisturizers, body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and powdered health drinks. I purchased a couple of these non-sheet mask items that I’ll review down the road (I still need to finish testing them), and I’ve been impressed enough with them that when I saw that the U.S. site Beautibi stocks some L’Herboflore products, I decided to order the Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner, something I regretted not picking up in Taipei. Aside from the fact that L’Herboflore products have impressed me, I was eager to incorporate more Taiwanese products, other than sheet masks, into my routine, since T-Beauty doesn’t get as much love around here as products from Korea, and to a lesser extent, Japan. \n\n*The low-down: what is this product?*\n\nThe L’Herboflore 蕾舒翠  [Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner 水盈潤晶露](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_detail.aspx?series=9&classid=29&id=88)   (hereafter known as Aqua Toner) is a hydrating toner that is part of [L’Herboflore’s Aqua Plus line](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=9&classid=29), which features products made from organic cactus elixir. The company claims that this toner will soothe irritated skin, hydrate one’s skin, and protect and firm one’s skin. \n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n(I don’t know if Taiwanese ingredients are listed in the same order as in the U.S., so I’m not sure how important the order is here; list is taken from the product box, which is slightly different from the Beautibi website) \n\nAqua (Water), Propanediol, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Polysaccharides, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Fragrance, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, O-CYMEN-5-OL. \n\nI put the ingredients into [Cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_479b233703.html). Please keep in mind that just because something isn’t flagged in Cosdna doesn’t mean it won’t be a problem for you. Similarly, Cosdna often flags things that are generally safe as being potentially unsafe as it doesn’t take into account the small concentration used in skin care products. In any case, please do not use this product if you have a known allergy or sensitivity to any of the above ingredients, and always patch test and isolation test new products. \n\n*According to Cosdna, the potentially acne-causing/unsafe ingredients (anything flagged a 3 or higher) are:*\n\n**Propylene glycol**, which is a humectant, receives a 3 for safety. Some people claim that it’s the same thing as antifreeze and that it’s a strong skin irritant. Paula’s Choice rates it as Good and explains that it’s used only in a tiny amount in skin care products (versus the amount you would find in antifreeze) and thus should not be an issue, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does not deem it carcinogenic. You’ll find this ingredient in a lot of products, including baby wipes, lip sticks, shampoos and conditioners, and moisturizers. I’ve seen it in a lot of my other products, and I’m still alive. \n\nThe only potential acne trigger is **Triethanolamine**, which is pretty low at 2, but gets a 5 for safety. What is this supposedly dangerous substance? Triethanolamine is primarily used to adjust pH, but it also functions as an emulsifier. It’s found in various cosmetics, hair products, shaving creams, and sunscreens, in addition to some skin care products. The FDA has approved it as being safe for use as long as it is in a concentration below 5%. Various sources I checked said that in spite of the FDA approval, it shouldn’t be used long term. Paula’s Choice doesn’t seem to think it’s an issue and ranks it as Good, since the concentration used in cosmetics and skin care is low. I don’t know what the percentage is here, but I’m going to assume it’s less than 5%. \n\n**PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil** gets a 3 for safety. An emollient ingredient, Paula’s Choice gives it a rating of Good, though there are plenty of sites that are suspicious of it and recommend that is not be used on damaged or injured skin. \n\n**Fragrance** is flagged as being 1-4 in terms of safety, but we have no idea what kind of fragrance is being used here, or what concentration. I can say that the scent is rather light and dissipates quickly, so I don’t see fragrance as being an issue for most people with this product. \n\n**Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate**, a water-based preservative found in a wealth of skin care products and cosmetics, as well as many other products, gets a 4-6 for safety. It earns a Good from Paula’s Choice, and as the concentration used is likely very small, it shouldn’t be a concern for most people. I like my preservatives. \n\nOkay, those are the “flagged” ingredients. After doing my own research on them, I’m not concerned that I’m about to melt off my face or contract cancer from using this product, but I am not a medical or scientific expert. Use this product at your own risk. \n\n*Onto the GOOD ingredients!*\n\nOur star is the **organic cactus extract**, or **Opuntia ficus-indica stem extract** (also known as **prickly pear extract**). I have no idea what the concentration is. According to multiple sources, cactus extract is supposed to be good for moisturizing, protecting, soothing, and firming. It’s also rich in antioxidants and fatty acids. Native Americans allegedly used cactus to treat burns.  (Side note: it’s also edible, and used in a variety of juices, jellies, alcoholic drinks, candies, and teas). Cactus extract contains Vitamin E, which helps soften skin, and Vitamin K, which helps reduce the appearance of dark circles and promote skin elasticity. It’s known for its anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it good for sensitive skin. It’s also high in essential fatty acids. It’s thought to be suitable for all skin types and especially good for mature and sensitive skin. (There are too many articles here to list, but if you search for “prickly pear” or “Opuntia ficus-indica stem extract” or “cactus” and “skin care,” you’ll find a lot of interesting results.) Spoiler alert: using my own face as a test study, this ingredient lives up to all of its hype (except the dark eye circles, which I don’t have, so I don’t know how well it works on those). I could keep raving about this ingredient, but let’s move on so we can get to the actual product. \n\nAnother notable ingredient is **aloe barbadensis leaf polysaccharides**, which is a known anti-irritant and also helps restore suppleness. My sensitive skin loves aloe, so this is another plus for me. \n\nAnother good ingredient is **panthenol**, a humectant that’s an alcohol form of the B vitamin pantothenic acid.\n\nAnd then there’s **dipotassium glycyrrhizate**, which is a fancy way of referring to **licorice root extract**. As many of us licorice root fans know, licorice root is anti-inflammatory and an anti-irritant and has been known to work as a brightening agent and to help reduce the redness and irritation associated with rosacea and acne. I have mild rosacea, so I am thrilled that this ingredient is included. \n\n**Sodium hyaluronate**, a water-soluble salt form of our pal hyaluronic acid, is another winner. It has a smaller molecular size than hyaluronic acid, and thus is able to more easily penetrate the skin, and like HA, it is able to hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. There are many more great things I could say about this product, but most of us are familiar with the benefits of hyaluronic acid. \n\n**Sclerocarya birrea seed oil**, also known as **Marula oil**, is predominantly oleic acid, and it also contains stearic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. It is an antiaging oil that hydrates, protects, and rejuvenates skin. \n\nSo as you can see, this toner is chock full of lots of great ingredients, and in spite of Cosdna’s flagging some of the ingredients for safety (which doesn’t concern me after doing my own research), nothing is flagged as being potentially irritating, and there’s only one potential acne trigger, with a rating of 2 (very low). That said, please remember that YMMV. \n\n*Packaging:*\n\nAqua Toner comes in a sleek 4.05 fl. oz./120 mL airless white pump that I think is made of plastic (at least on the outside). The only negative I would say about the container is that you can’t see how much product you have left, but I suppose the old flashlight trick would work. The product dispenses easily. \n\n*pH:*\n\nI tested the pH, and it comes out to about 5. Perfectly acceptable in my book for a hydrating toner, though probably too high to be a pH-adjusting toner. \n\n*Texture and fragrance:*\n\nThe product is a clear gel with a very faint scent—it’s hard for me to say what it smells like. I want to say “cactus,” but I have no idea what cactus smells like. It strangely reminds me of the scent of Aussie Sprunch Spray in the purple bottle, but much lighter. I don’t find it overpowering or irritating, and it dissipates pretty quickly once the product is absorbed. I was surprised to see that the product is a gel, as it’s my first time to use a gel toner, but the gel quickly melts into the skin.\n\n*How to use:*\n\nThe instructions on the bottle read (in English): “Use morning and evening after cleansing. Take 2-3 pumps to a cotton pad and smooth over face and neck.” (The instructions on the box are in Chinese and say the same thing.) If you use a First Essence, you may wish to use the FTE first if you follow the “thinnest to thickest rule.” At the same time, I have mixed feelings about this, as this product is a great booster for other products, so if you use the Aqua Toner first, your FTE might absorb better. You could play around with it and see what you prefer. Since it’s a gel, I don’t use a cotton pad, which seems like it would waste a lot of precious product—I generally squirt a pump or two onto my hand and apply to one section of my face at a time, patting in with my fingertips, then moving onto the next section. I probably divide my face into three sections (so anywhere from 3-6 pumps of product used at one time), but then I apply the toner around my eye area as well. I’m liberal with it around my eyes because I’ve had such amazing results, as detailed below. I use it both morning at night. The product absorbs pretty quickly, so you don’t have to wait too long to continue your routine. It might even absorb more quickly than other toners I’ve used. \n\n*How I tested this product + my impressions:*\n\nI started testing this toner back in late February/early March, but when my skin broke out in hives due to an unrelated reaction from a hair product getting on my face, I had to reset my routine from zero and put this toner on hold. This meant I wasn’t using any toner for most of March, and in early April I only used Evian mist (pure water) as my toner. When it came time to add a proper toner back into my routine during the last third of April, I reached for the Aqua Toner, since my other sensitive skin toners (Acwell and Klairs) were near-empty, and the ingredients list looked pretty clean. I was quite apprehensive, since I was still haunted by memories of itchy, angry red hives, and I was afraid of a relapse. Fortunately, the Aqua Toner got along well with my skin and caused absolutely no negative reaction (no breakouts, no irritation, nada). \n\nI tested it about a week over my entire face, and I thought my skin seemed suppler, but to test my hunch, for a couple of days after, I only applied the Aqua Toner to the left side of my face, and I applied my almost-empty bottle of Whamisa Organic Flowers Deep Rich Essence Toner to the right side. The difference was palpable after a couple of days: my left side was softer, bouncier, and much more pleasant to touch, and my left cheek was less red and irritated (I have sensitive skin and mild rosacea, and my cheeks gets irritated just by existing). The right side of my face became very jealous from all the attention lavished upon my left, and so I aborted my split-face experiment before a week had elapsed—I wanted that bounciness all over. \n\nThe more I use this product, the more I love it. I’ve probably used it for about 3 ½ weeks, not including my first testing round that was cut short due to hives. I still have a pretty minimalist routine (no ampoules/essences/serums except for my beloved Shark Sauce), but you’d never know it. I even stopped using my First Essence and am just using the Aqua Toner to prep my skin, and I still have The Glow (granted, Shark Sauce is probably also giving me The Glow, so maybe this comment is less about the Aqua Toner and more about the inefficacy of my current FTE). But the best thing is I have that Gym Mat Effect—do you remember the mats you used in gym class when you did gymnastics? That’s how my skin feels: firm yet soft, and bouncy. QQ, as the Taiwanese say. Now, I have a couple of other products that help with the Gym Mat Effect (Shark Sauce, L’Herboflore Flora Supreme Recovery Infusion Crème), but when I feel my face after applying the Aqua Toner and before applying those other products, I still have the coveted Gym Mat Effect. I feel like a narcissist because I can’t stop touching my face. I’m sad that I’m single because someone else needs to be stroking my Gym Mat Face. \n\nAnother perk of this toner is that it helps to minimize the fine lines around my eyes. I’m in my 30s, and thanks to my oily T-zone, my forehead is still smooth, but I have pesky fine lines in the corners and underneath my yes. My eye cream helps a little bit, but this toner makes the lines almost non-existent (almost…you can still see they’re there, but they’re way less visible). The effect also gets better each day; the past couple of mornings, I’ve awakened to a very smooth, almost line-free eye area, and it’s stunning. I can’t help but wonder what amazement would happen if I had a better eye cream to work in conjunction with this toner (I do have the eye cream in the same line, but I’m waiting to use up my lackluster Whamisa eye essence before I start the new product—I hope the Aqua line eye cream won’t disappoint). This is where the toner exceeds my expectations: I expect my toner to hydrate and prep my skin for the additional goodness that’s going to come its way, and if I’m greedy, I might expect my toner to be soothing, and I definitely expect my toner NOT to irritate my skin, but it never occurred to me that I could expect my toner to help diminish the appearance of fine lines. I thought that’s what fancy serums were for. (Let’s be clear: the lines are still there, but my skin is so plumped with hydration that you can’t see them that well—after all, this product doesn’t contain actives like retinol.) \n\nThe longer I use this product, the better results I see. The first couple of days I used it, I thought it was just an ordinary toner in a strange gel form, but now it’s my favorite step of my routine. Not only does the toner itself seem quite effective at soothing, firming, and hydrating, but moreover, I think it’s acting as a booster to make the products that I subsequently apply more effective. I swear my skin gets bouncier and more Gym Mat-esque each day. \n\n*Who might benefit from using this product:*\n\nI believe anyone would benefit, unless you have an allergy or sensitivity to any of the ingredients, in which case, please stay far away. L’Herboflore’s Facebook page implies that it’s suited to all seasons and all skin types (of course they want to sell product, so why not say that?). I think the people who would see the most results are probably people who are in need of some serious hydration (dehydrated and/or dry skin types) and people who are concerned about anti-aging. I have sensitive combination skin, and it doesn’t make my T-zone oily, and my usually dry and sensitive cheeks aren’t dry and are less sensitive. Some of the ingredients are supposed to be helpful for reducing inflammation and acne, so it might also be a useful product to someone who is acne-prone. I’m not sure how someone with oily skin would react to this product, especially during hot and humid weather. As I said, it doesn’t make my T-zone oilier, but I think I’m less oily than many, and I know some people prefer to use a toner that helps to control oil. Moreover, the weather hasn’t been that hot since I’ve starting using the toner. \n\n*How does it stack up to other toners?*\n\nFor comparison, the three hydrating toners I’ve used in the past year are the above-mentioned Whamisa toner, the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner (original version before the upgrade), and the Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner. The Whamisa is too rich for my skin, especially in summer, and as I discussed previously, it doesn’t give my skin that Gym Mat feel that the Aqua Toner does. I find the Klairs toner very soothing, but nowhere near as hydrating as the L’Herboflore. As for the Acwell toner, I like using it to wipe off residue from Vitamin C or other actives, and the L’Herboflore definitely doesn’t have that “cleansing” aspect. The Acwell didn’t soothe my skin as much as the Klairs toner, and it wasn’t as hydrating for me as either of the other two. (I’ll probably repurchase the Acwell however to have on hand for post-actives cleansing.) \n\n*Where to get this product, and how much will it cost you?*\n\nAs I mentioned, I purchased my bottle from the U.S. retailer [Beautibi](https://www.beautibi.com/collections/lherboflore/products/lherboflore-aqua-plus-moisturizing-toner), where it costs US $48. Beautibi does ship internationally. (And to reiterate, I am not shilling for this site. I love the curation, but I gain nothing by you shopping there. In fact, if you do buy the toner there, that’s one less bottle for me to buy.   )  I have not found any other North American retailer that sells this product. \n\nIf you live in Taiwan, China, Malaysia, or Singapore (I believe Singapore has a physical L’Herboflore stand, but maybe it’s only online ordering), you can visit a L’Herboflore stand in person or probably order online (for example, in China, you can order L’Herboflore off of Taobao—I’m not sure if Taobao ships internationally). According to the official L’Herboflore site, the toner retails for NTD $1500, which is about US $45 (so you can see that the Beautibi markup is not that big). I included the Chinese name of the product above in case you want to do an Internet search, which might turn up more possible places where you can purchase it. \n\n*My rating:*\n\n**Five out of five buckets of snail slime and bee spit**, in spite of the fact that Cosdna thinks it might kill me, and in spite of the fact that it’s the priciest toner I’ve ever purchased. I’m apprehensive to give a product such a high rating, since skin care varies so much by person, but this product continues to impress me each day. Maybe I’m having such good results because my hive outbreak left my face dry, flaky, and in such bad shape that things could only get better, but that makes the product even more impressive to me, since when I started using this product the second time around, my skin was still hypersensitive. I’ll definitely repurchase, though I have the “upgraded” Klairs toner in my closet that I’ll need to try first. \n\nI’ll be reviewing three other L’Herboflore skin care products in the coming week (two others from the Aqua line, one from the Flora line), so we’ll see if the rest stack up. So far, I am very excited about the brand and about T-Beauty, and I regret that I didn't buy one of everything that L’Herboflore sells when I had the chance in person. \n\n*Final disclaimer:*\n\nIt concerns me that someone could read this and drop almost $50 on a product that potentially doesn’t work for him/her, so if you choose to purchase this toner, please do so at your own risk. Remember that what gives one person a Gym Mat Face could give another person a dermatological nightmare. \n",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

    "body": "Warning this post is a long one:\n\nSo I went to cancel my base box and saw that Boxycharm had already put some spoilers up for the upcoming pop up sale, (someone made a posted already with the items, so you can see it there) obviously the lovely 111SKIN item caught my eyes.  As of right now base on the price of $24, I’m incline to believe the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask shown on the picture would be a “real” 111SKIN item, made in the same factory in UK as the other 111SKIN items that gets sent to Saks, SpaceNK, CultBeauty, their actual website.  So yay no fake “made in China for 111SKIN” crap, where the ingredients for the same 2 products are miles apart and completely different (see my post on Avant and 111skin, if you’re interested). \n\nSo is the real 111SKIN made in UK Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask that has a RV of $200 worth it? Let’s have a look.  \n\nFor people who aren’t skincare nerds, a moisturizer/night mask (basically the same, especially this one since it tells you to apply on dry skin, I’m guessing 111SKIN wants you to use this instead of a moisturizer at night) should always contain these 3 different types of ingredients, occlusives, humectants, and emollients. (For more detailed info on these types of ingredients, read the long explanation at the end).  \n\nFor now I’ll get to the short definitions\n\n- Occlusives are ingredients that form a seal around the skin and traps water in order to prevent transepidermal water loss.  Having hydrated skin is very important in age prevention.  Depending on the occlusive ingredient, it can also prevent irritants, pollution, dirt, etc from. coming in contact with the skin.  Common occlusive ingredients: sunflower seed oil, silicones, squalane, beeswax and carnauba wax, Shea, cocoa, mango butters, mineral oil (nothing wrong with mineral oil I go further into details about this later on), lanolin. \n\n- Humectants are “compounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.” (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information).  Common humectants used in moisturizers: glycerin, hyaluronic acid (and its many forms such as sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid etc), amino acids, hexylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, aloe vera.  \n\n- Finally we have emollient type ingredients, they are used in moisturizers to soften and smooth the skin, also it acts as a lubricating agent, if you have cracked and flaky skin emollients can help fill the the open spaces with fatty acids (lipids) and prevent water loss.  Now many occlusive ingredients are also going to be emollient ingredients as well (like beeswax and carnauba wax) common emollient ingredients used, borage seed oil, Shea butter, almond oil, avocado oil, caprylic/capric, triglyceride, cetyl alcohol, cholesterol. \n\nSo now we’ve listed the 3 types of ingredients that make up moisturizers (obviously other types of ingredients like antioxidants, texture enhancer, preservatives etc are also in moisturizers but these 3 are the building blocks/foundation of any moisturizer).  \n\nIngredients of the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask (ingredients list taken from 111skin.com):\n\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN (a very good start, glycerin is one of the best humectants, and it’s the 2nd ingredient which probably means they are going for the gel like texture for this product), PANTHENOL (Vitamin B5, like glycerin it’s a great humectant.  Draws water from the air and from the deeper layers of the skin to the top layer so that it can plump out the skin thus wrinkles and fine lines look less visible and skin feels smoother.  Its also an excellent soothing ingredient, helping reduce inflammation, redness, irritation.  It helps to repair and strengthen the skin’s protective barrier and its a great antioxidant.), XANTHAN GUM (and here’s where the good for skin ingredients end, xanthan gum excellent thickening agent and texture enhancer It’ll make formulas that’s too watery more gel like.  However the typical concentration of xanthan gum in products are between 0.1% to 0.5%, now this being the 4th ingredient means again 111SKIN wants a gel texture for this overnight mask, cos this is most likely 2 or 1%.  Xanthan gum is perfectly safe and natural it’s just a chain of sugar molecules), ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER (another ingredient used to thicken products/viscosity control.  Now the presence of xanthan gum in high concentrations, and now this ingredient makes me think the Meso Overnight Mask is mostly made of water hence why there’s all these thickening agents, even glycerin has a syrup like texture, so not watery), SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE (a vitamin c derivative that’s very stable and is used in Olehenriksen’s Truth Serum, it’s an antioxidant and an active ingredient that should be the 2nd or 3rd on the list, as the 6th ingredient I’m guessing the concentration is below 1%, what is the point of having below 1% vitamin c derivative especially since they are less effective than vitamin c (Ascorbic acid) plus I don’t see any other powerful antioxidants in this product, yes there’s panthenol but that doesn’t require vitamin c derivative to boost its effectiveness, unlike having vitamin e will increase the effectiveness of vitamin c), NATTO GUM (created through the fermentation of a proprietary strain of bacteria (the safe kinds), not enough research on this one, may become a potent antioxidant), PHENOXYETHANOL (preservatives), SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE(another bloody ingredient that’s used to make something more viscous in texture, so basically it thickens the formula to form a gel, okay we get it 111SKIN you like gel textures), SODIUM HYALURONATE (wow a humectant, salt form of hyaluronic acid), PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL (an emulsifier that’s amber/yellowish in colour (and that’s the colour of the Meso Overnight Mask) its used to solubilized fragrances into water based formulas, it really seems like there’s a lot of water in this product), SORGHUM BICOLOR STALK JUICE (not much information on this one besides skin conditioning agent, soften and hydrates, maybe? But some sites will tell you that it’ll tighten skin and creates a immediate lifting effect.  Again until I find a study or a ton of anecdotal evidence, I’ll call bs on the tightening and lifting claims for now), ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN (preservative), SODIUM HYDROXIDE (a very alkaline pH adjuster), SODIUM BENZOATE (preservative against fungi, not strong enough to work by itself so it’s usually combined with the next ingredient, works best at acidic pH of 3-5, our skin’s natural pH levels are usually between 5.5 to 6.5), POTASSIUM SORBATE (preservative thats not strong and often is paired with the previous ingredient) PENTYLENE GLYCOL (a humectant, also makes product feel nice on the skin), HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT (antioxidant, antibacterial, not sure why it’s at the end of the ingredients list in such low concentrations), CAPRYLYL GLYCOL (it’s a humectant, but it’s mainly used cos of its ability to boost the effectiveness of other preservatives mainly phenoxyethanol, there are sure a lot of preservatives on this ingredient list), PARFUM / FRAGRANCE.\n\nSo here’s the breakdown of the $200 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask. NO OCCLUSIVES, NO EMOLLIENTS, the best ingredient is the panthenol, but without any occlusive/emollients ingredients everything will evaporate right off the skin that also will take moisture from your own skin too!  After analyzing the ingredients list of this lovely $200 product I’m incline to believe it’s basically water.  I like the panthenol but La Roche Pasay Cicaplast Balm B5 is so better, and it also has a gel version, it’s also $15. \n\nSeriously wtf is 111SKIN thinking? I can’t even consider this as a moisturizer or serum or overnight mask or toner, I don’t know what kind of product this is....cos from looking at the ingredients it’s just water with panthenol and a lot of THICKENING AGENTS to get that gel texture.  \n\nBelow are more information on occlusives, humectants and emollients if you’re interested feel free to have a look: \n\nOcclusives are ingredients that form a physical barrier around your face so that all the moisture from serums and moisturizer won’t evaporate off the skin making it drier, you’ll often hear dermatologists refer to this as transepidermal water loss (TEWL), for obvious reasons having a hydrated skin will contribute greatly to age prevention.  They also act as a shield protecting the skin from physical irritates, pollution, etc, think of occlusive ingredients as a saran wrap for your face or body, except it only traps the water and keep out irritates especially for people who have compromised skin barriers.  Some examples of widely used occlusives are: \n\n- Shea butter, cocoa butter, mango butter \n\n- Petroleum jelly and by default mineral oil since it’s derived from petroleum, for reasons unknown the Clean Beauty Movement has demonized Vaseline (and mineral oil) and it’s been made out to be this monster that’ll take your first born and use it as a sacrifice, but it’s still one of the best occlusive ingredients we have, quote from one study on moisturizers “Petrolatum in a minimum concentration of 5% reduces TEWL by more than 98% followed by lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.”obviously it’s less cosmetically elegant (it’s grease) but perfectly safe to use the molecules are too big to get into the skin that’s why it makes such a good barrier ESPECIALLY for people who suffer from compromised skin barrier issues (eczema, psoriasis etc) and when you’ve messed up your skin barrier with too much retinol and exfoliating acids.  The new trend in Korea is I think called “slipping”? Where people put on a layer of Vaseline before bed to stop TEWL.  As for people with oily skin maybe stay away from this one. \n\n- Squalane, soy, sunflower oil, lecithin\n\n- Cholesterol and ceramides (two important skin lipids that can be found in the famous Skinceuticals moisturizer 2:4:2 (the first 2 are two different ceramides, 4 is 4% cholesterol, and the last 2 are fatty acids, it looks like they used sunflower seed oil)\n\n- Beeswax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax\n\n- Lanolin, silicones \n\nSorry for rambling, next important class of ingredients are humectants, “compounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.” (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information). Common humectants used are:\n\n- Glycerin \n\n- Propylene glycol (again the Clean Beauty Industry has labelled this one as antifreeze and brake fluid....long story short, it’s not and safe to use), hexylene glycol, butylene glycol.\n\n- Hyaluronic acid and it’s many forms, like sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate etc \n\n- Lactic acid, PHA (the acids that’s in Glow Recipe’s toner, or Olehenriksen’s Phat Mask) it’s a very gentle exfoliating acid and they also retain moisture. \n\n- Urea, amino acids \n\n- Aloe Vera \n\nFinally we get to last category of ingredients, emollient ingredients are used in moisturizer to make your skin soft and smooth like a new born baby (I wish it were that easy). They are usually lipids (fatty acids, which are super important to a healthy skin barrier) and oils,  a lot of occlusives are also emollients.  Common emollients found in moisturizers (some are also occlusives) \n\n- Lanolin \n\n- beeswax \n\n- Shea butter \n\n- Jojoba oil \n\n- Castor oil \n\n- Moringa seed oil \n\n- Linoleic acid\n\nTL:DR : even if the 111SKIN Overnight Mask in the pop up spoiler is real as in made in UK with all the other real products that’s going to be sold in Saks, CultBeauty, SpaceNK etc, it’s still junk, beyond junk, it’s basically water, and then a lot of ingredients to make the water into a gel, the ONLY beneficial ingredients are panthenol (vitamin B5), glycerin, and hyaluronic acid....seriously that’s it, all those ingredients are available in the Ordinary’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum.",

The formula is suitable for all skin types and also appropriate for breakout-prone skin.\n\n**Ingredients**: \n\nWater, Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C/antioxidant), Ethoxydiglycol (slip agent/penetration enhancer), PPG-26 Buteth-26 (emulsifier), PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil (thickener), Tocopherol (vitamin E/antioxidant), Ferulic Acid (antioxidant), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin-repairing ingredient), Acetyl Octapeptide-3 (cell-communicating ingredient), Glycerin (skin-repairing ingredient), Panthenol (skin conditioning agent), Sodium Metabisulfite (stabilizer/antioxidant), Triethanolamine (pH adjuster), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).\n\n**My skin type, in detail**: \n\nSensitive, very irritation-prone, dry-combination (dry cheeks, oily t-zone), very small pores, easily congested skin, stubborn acne spots. Responds well to BP spot treatments. Responds well to BHA and anti-inflammatories. Responds well to lactic acid (AHA). Responds okay to glycolic acid (AHA), can be irritating. Responds very poorly to tretinoin (retin-a, renova, adapalene). Many ingredients break me out (cetearyl, cetyl alcohol; natural oils; some fillers/thickeners).\n\n**My current routine as of Dec. 3, 2013**:\n\n* AM - Cleanse with [PC Hydralight Cleanser](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Hydralight/_/Hydralight-One-Step-Cleanser/)\n* AM - Tone with [PC Hydralight Toner](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Hydralight/_/Hydralight-Healthy-Skin-Refreshing-Toner/)\n* AM - Pat on 3-5 drops [PC C15 Super Booster](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/antioxidants/_/RESIST-C15-Super-Booster/). Allow to absorb 5-10 minutes.\n* AM - Pat on pea-sized amount of [Elta MD PM Therapy](http://eltamd.com/product/pm-therapy-facial-moisturizer/) if feeling dry.\n* AM - Apply [Skinceuticals Physical Fusion](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/physical-fusion-uv-defense-spf-50.htm) is going out for extended periods of time (15m or more).\n* PM - Remove makeup or sunscreen with [Albolene](http://www.albolenecleanser.com/) or [Clinique TTDOB](http://www.clinique.com/product/1673/6424/Skincare/Cleansers_Makeup_Removers/Take-The-Day-Off-Cleansing-Balm/index.tmpl). If no makeup or SS, skip step.\n* PM - Proceed with normal AM cleanse/tone routine.\n* PM - Apply 2 drops of C15 to nose, cheekbones, under eyes.\n* PM - Mix 3 drops C15 with 1 squirt of BHA 9. Apply all over trouble areas (forehead, below cheekbones, jaw). Let absorb 10-15 minutes if possible.\n* PM - Pat on pea-sized amount of Elta MD PM.\n* PM - Pat on tiniest amount of Vaseline on driest spots, if needed.\n\n**Other skincare habits and details**:\n\n* I have taken Ortho Tri Cyclen for about 5 years now.\n* My diet isn't anything to write home to mom about. I enjoy fatty foods and red meats. I drink very little soda and consume virtually no sweets. \n* I sleep on a silk pillowcase.\n* I do not wash my pillowcase every night. I'm lucky if I remember to wash it once a week. Gross, I know.\n* I rarely talk on the phone, and when I do, you can bet my phone hasn't been wiped down with alcohol in the past week. Sorry, y'all.  \n\n**Review**:\n\nI have been using this product for roughly 1.5-2 months now. I first picked up a sample with my 2% BHA liquid re-order out of sheer curiosity. I had heard many good things about the product, from people like [Goss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaKI15KTTes) to [Veronica Gorgeois](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKOvcV6nnM) (who I do really like and feel gives pretty solid skincare advice, if you want an educated YouTuber). The sample is a bit larger than a normal sized perfume sample and lasted me about 7-10 days at 5 drops per day. \n\nAs a background, I have been using NuFountain 10% Vitamin C serum for roughly 6 months (20% was consistently too irritating for my skin and broke me out in tons of angry, red bumps). NuFountain's formula is very light and basic, consisting of essentially water, 10% L-AA (form of vitamin C), and glycerin. It feels a lot like water, but needs to be refrigerated due to the lack of preservatives and the unstable form of vitamin C. \n\nBy comparison, the Paula's Choice serum is a bit thicker than water, but not entirely gel-like. It is also a bit tacky once it is applied to the skin. Since I apply it after toning and before a moisturizer, it hasn't bothered me. It also becomes less tacky over time.\n\nThe packaging is also excellent. It comes in a box with the bottle dropper separate from the bottle itself (which is sealed, obviously). Inside the bottle is a bit of a seal so the product remains air-tight when not in use, which is excellent for an antioxidant serum where the antioxidants can become unstable and/or ineffective if exposed to oxygen too long. \n\nAlso, at $45 USD, this is a great dupe or replacement for the famous [$153 Skinceuticals CE Ferulic](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/c-e-ferulic.htm) serum.\n\nNow, I cannot compare this product to the Skinceuticals product, since I have not used it myself. However, I can say that I have achieved much better results from this product as opposed to my NuFountain. While I like the NuFountain, it hasn't been a complete game-changer like the PC C15 has been. \n\nWithin my first 3 days of usage of the sample (in place of my NuFountain serum), I noticed I had bouncier, supple, healthier looking skin. My skin also felt a bit more moisturized -- a big deal for a dry skinned lady like myself that can't use a majority of fatty alcohols. \n\nMy glowy skin remained all while I used the product. It also became a bit more even-toned and my acne less inflamed. \n\nEventually, I ran out of the sample and went back to my NuFountain serum. Within 3 days or so, my skin returned to it's less glowy, less refined, drier, and not-quite-as-healthy-looking state. I ordered a bottle of the C15 and began using it as soon as it came in.\n\nWithin 3 days my skin's state while using the sample had returned. Healthy, vibrant, less angry looking. \n\nI'm almost 2 months in of consistent usage and my skin is still very healthy and glowy looking. Definitely a HG product for me. \n\n**Bottom line**: \n\nDo I recommend this? Yes, especially if you are looking for a good C serum without the enormous price tag and are not sensitive to tocopherol (vitamin E). \n\n**Other notes relating to this serum**:\n\n* [Ferulic acid and why you should consider adding it to your skincare routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1oovij/ferulic_acid_and_why_you_should_consider_adding/)\n\n---\n\nEdit: Paula's Choice now has a Refer-a-Friend program -- someone refers you, you save $10 on your first purchase.

Basically any lotions that are manufactured here in the SEA has a different formula now. \n\nI was quite devastated at first as I have been a loyal consumer of the Premium Shirojyun Whitening Rich Lotion for 5 years. After the news got out, I found myself a way to get the ones with the OG formula, since they are still manufactured with the same formula from other countries outside of SEA(mainly china or japan).\n\nThe hada labo Mild Peeling Lotion which used to have a very minimal ingredient, now has a long list of them. It did amazing for my dry dull sensitive skin as the exfoliating ingredients were only a PHA and tranexamic acid. And knowing that they changed the formula is breaking my heart. I also found a post in this sub somewhere saying that this particular lotion(or rather the whole range, im not sure) is only being sold in SEA, which means they do not sell it anywhere else? I hope this is not true. \n\nDoes anyone know a dupe to this? I basically in need a toner with PHA and brightening ingredients. I’m not a fond of BHA since I found it could be a bit too drying on my skin. I will list out the ingredients before and after they changed it for the Mild Peeling Lotion.\n\nbefore: \nWater, Gluconic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Tranexamic Acid, Polyquaternium-51, Sodium Metabisulfite, Phenoxyethanol\n\nafter:\nWater, Niacinamide, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Fomes Officinalis (Mushroom)\nExtract, Triethanolamine, Salicylic Acid, PEG-12\nDimethicone, Chlorphenesin, Amylopectin, Glycolic Acid, Lactobionic Acid, Hydroxyethy|piperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Dextrin, Xanthan Gum, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Urea, Trehalose, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Serine, Pentylene Glycol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Sodium\nHyaluronate, Hydroxyethy|cellulose, Olea Europaea (Olive)\nLeaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Disodium Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Algin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate",

    "body": "So I've been testing this product over the past month, and since I haven't seen any other reviews of it I figured I would write one myself!\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is dehydrated from tret. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. I started using tret in november of last year, and had 5-6 weeks of purging consisting of cystic acne on both cheeks, which resulted in pretty bad PIH. My persistent acne has since cleared up, but I still get random spots that pop up here and there, and they usually end up in PIH regardless of whether or not I picked at it. For reference, here is my full routine:\n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)   \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)    \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nMissha FTE Intensive  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence    \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nCosrx honey sleeping pack  \n\nBoth the Missha FTE and the NR emulsion contain niacinamide, but they didn't make a significant difference in fading my PIH, which is why I decided to try out the capsule essence. For some reason, I can't find the product on the nature republic website right now, but when I last checked the site it states that the product contains 5% niacinamide! The product packaging also states 5%. The other products in the white vita line, if I remember correctly, contain 2%.  \n\n\n**Edited to add** Ingredients: Water, Niacinamide (5%), Methylpropanediol, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Articum Lappa Root Extract, Pancratium Maritimum Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Nymphaea Alba Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Tranexamic Acid, Panthenol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Gelatin, Carbomer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-51, Glycosyl Trehalose, Glycerin, Cellulose Gum, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Raffinose, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Disodium EDTA, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Calcium Alginate, Agar, Gellan Gum, Propanediol, Acetic Acid, Dipropylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Zinc PCA, Sodium Palmitoyl Proline, Inositol, Bisabolol, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bioflavonoids, Ascorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Hesperidin, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate  \n\nThe essence is a clear, slightly runny gel. You can see tiny bead-like capsules in the bottle, but they aren't so noticeable when you pump out the product and apply it. It sinks in quickly and provides light hydration. There is a slight tackiness after it absorbs, but it goes away after I apply the rest of my routine. The essence does contain fragrance, but the scent is surprisingly very subtle and clean. I barely notice it, unlike with the other NR products I've used. Also the essence came in a set with mini versions of the white vita toner and emulsion (I don't think NR sells the essence by itself, although some other online sellers might). Unfortunately they both contain alcohol, which I am sensitive to, so I couldn't test those.\n\nSo, does the essence work? For me, yes! I've noticed that over the past few weeks, my PIH is fading much faster than usual. The stubborn marks all over my cheeks have become noticeably lighter. Now that the PIH is finally going away, I barely need to use concealer for them. I haven't introduced any other products over the past month, so for now I'm attributing the improvement to this essence. I'm hoping this improvement continues, and if it does, this essence might find a permanent spot in my routine.\n",

Also, except the fact that they used too many extracts/fragrances,  they use pretty safe stuffs like pentylene glycol and methypropanediol for solvents. Betaine is a nice moisturizer, and sodium hyaluronate and Argan are also added. Even though negligible amount, Retinyl Palmitate & Vitamin C is there as well. This is a serum with excellent ingredients. Amazing!!\nAgain, Thanks for sharing!! I would definitely go online, and order it. \n\nLove, \n\nRandy",

    "body": "I had been wanting to try the old NR FTE for a long time, but it was discontinued earlier this year. Since I really liked the white vita capsule essence, I decided to take a chance on the white vita first essence after my Missha FTE intensive ran out. Since I haven't seen reviews for this product, I figured it would be good to post one myself.\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is extremely dehydrated. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. My main concerns are keeping my skin hydrated, fading PIH, decreasing redness, and acne prevention. For reference, here is my full routine:  \n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)  \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)  \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nNR white vita first essence  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence  \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nDr. Jart ceramidin cream    \n\nIngredients: Saccharomyces ferment (edited to add: 87.8%), methylpropanediol, propanediol, niacinamide (2%), betaine, phellinus linteus extract, articum lappa root extract, dioscorea japonica root extract, pancratium maritimum extract, nymphaea alba flower extract, olea europaea (olive) leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, argania spinosa kernel oil, hydrogenated lecithin, 1,2-hexanediol, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, water, glycerin, sodium citrate, bifida ferment lysate, ethylhexylglycerin, citric acid, polyquaternium-51, glycosyl trehalose, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, raffinose, biosaccharide gum-1, butylene glycol, lecithin, dipropylene glycol, sodium palmitoyl proline, bisabolol, acetic acid, lactic acid, dicaprylyl carbonate, ascorbyl glucoside, zinc pca, sucrose distearate, ceramide np, retinyl palmitate, bioflavonoids, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, hesperidin, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate  \n\nTexture: The first essence is a runny liquid, but has a slight viscosity to it when compared to water. It isn't as runny as the Missha FTE. It sinks in well and provides light hydration, definitely more hydrating than the Missha. The first essence has the same light fragrance as the white vita capsule essence.  \n\nEffect: Glow! The NR first essence has given my skin much more glow than the Missha FTE did. In addition to the glow, the NR has helped with reducing PIH (the Missha had no effect on PIH). My white vita capsule essence was already doing a good job of lightening PIH, and using the first essence along with it has boosted the speed at which the PIH fades. I'm really glad I took a chance and tried the white vita first essence.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "So there are roughly 12748 reviews of the Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin toner. Apparently it's actual magic, according to said reviews. However! There really don't seem to be any reviews of the **Softfull** Booskin toner. Like really zero. I looked. A lot. To my knowledge it isn't discontinued or anything (it's still available for purchase on several websites), so I was surprised that there was just so much...*nothing*. \n\nAnyways, I'm going to leave a review here in hopes that it will help someone else down the road. \n\nFor reference, my skin is combo/oily, dehydrated and clog prone because I have giant pores. My skin is not a fan of denatured alcohol or silicones, but otherwise I'm not sensitive to much. Fragrance is okay with me, too.\n\n**What it Does:** According to the product descriptions, the Softfull Booskin is meant to \"control unnecessary and excessive sebum and prevent shine to boost clear and clean skin. Optimizes condition of oily skin after cleansing to [enhance] the effect of the next stage of care. Creates moisturized skin inside and smooth and matte skin outside.\" Oh, and my favorite part: \"Creates cotton veil for soft and gentle skin texture like downy hair and fills moisture evenly with tightening effect.\" \n\nOh man, skin that feels like downy hair? Sign me up! #goals\n\nWhat I've gathered is that, like the Moistfull Booskin, it's meant to be a hydrating/prepping toner for oily skin. That's how I've been using it, at least.\n\n\n**CosDNA Analysis:** \n\nUnfortunately, this one isn't on CosDNA. Only the Moistfull Booskin shows up. ;-; I've tried finding it on the Enprani website, buuuut since my Korean isn't the greatest (re: um mostly nonexistent), it didn't exactly go well. If anyone out there knows/has access to the exact ingredient list, I would *looove* to see it! I don't have the box, because this was purchased used from r/asianbeautyexchange. I know, I know. Sorry guys. \n\nI don't want to assume it's similar to the Moistfull Booskin because I genuinely have no idea. I will say that all of the product information I *was* able to find say that Rose of Jericho extract, witch hazel and cotton seed are a few of the star ingredients.\n\n**EXCITING UPDATE:** The absolutely lovely u/ganbattelilone was kind enough to post an ingredient list for me AND add it to CosDNA! Here you go, dears:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (licorice), Phenyl Methicone, **Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract**(this is Rose of Jericho), Propylene Glycol, **Witch Hazel Extract**, **Cotton Extract**, **Artichoke Leaf Extract**(improves elasticity), **Spiraea Ulmaria Extract**(this is meadowsweet- anti-irritant), PPG-16-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Triethylhexanoin, Fragrance.\n\nThe only potential trigger is the ever-present butylene glycol. \n\n*The following geek out is totally optional. Just skip down to the next part if you don't care about me nerding out over ingredients. I won't be offended, promise.* \n\nRose of Jericho is sweet, you guys. It's called the \"resurrection rose\" because it survives crazy desert climates by curling up into a dead-looking root ball. Once it detects moisture though, BAM! It opens up and comes alive [like this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41z0ifszDnL.jpg). Cool, right?! Apparently trehalose (a sugar) is responsible for this. In the plant, it regulates metabolic function to conserve energy; on skin, though, it binds moisture and gives a similar \"revival\" effect. \n\nIts dynamic nature is what (allegedly/anecdotally) makes it such a great skincare ingredient. Supposedly the extract contains some of the same enzymes that allow the plant to respond to its environment, which translates to skincare that's better suited to your specific skin/moisture levels. I couldn't find any scientific research on topical usage, so I don't know how true that is in general. I only know that biologically that makes sense to me and my own experience seems to support that reasonably well. So take it with a grain of salt.\n\n(ﾉ^ ヮ^ )ﾉ✧:・ﾟ✧ *OKAY GUYS /NERD RANT BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED REVIEW:*\n\n**My Experience:** \n\nI've been using this for ~3ish weeks for my morning and evening routine, as well as whenever I sheet mask.The first few days I used it, I did a split-face test to see 1. if it would cause a weird reaction, and 2. to see if it actually made a difference for the rest of my routine. \n\nOh boy. It made a huge difference. I was genuinely shocked by just how immediate and pronounced the difference was. I felt like my face was lopsided because the Booskin side was so soft and bouncy and the other side just wasn't.  \n\nThe bottle is huge, and I don't usually need much.The toner itself is very liquidy; it's really only slightly more viscous than water. The bottle has one of those tops that aftershave or hot sauce have where you need to tilt and shake it to get a couple of good splashes out. I like that, though, because it keeps me from accidentally spilling it everywhere. I use two splashes into my clean hands, pat them together and then pat the toner gently all over my face with my palms until it's fully absorbed. It absorbs quickly and my skin immediately feels softer and more hydrated. I don't have a cool digital skin analyzer (YET) but I *know* there's a difference in moisture levels. \n\n**There is definitely a scent.** And it lingers. Personally, I really love this part, but I know a lot of ABers are not in the Fragrance Fanclub. The scent is not overpowering at all, though. It's soft, feminine, a little powdery, a little floral, and a little bit of something else I can't quite place. Honestly, it just smells nostalgic to me, but not in a \"my-grandma's-Avon-perfume-from-1979\" way. Honestly, I'm happy it hangs around.\n\nIt makes every other product in my routine absorb quicker, and I feel like it helps the other products do their job better too, including my sheet mask essence. I guess that's the \"optimizing skin and enhancing care\" part! As for the controlling excess sebum aspect, I have been waking up with consistently less oily skin than I had been prior to adding this product to my daily routine.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** \n\nI love this toner. I was never really into toners of any kind prior to this. I was of the opinion that they were mostly just a waste of time and money. I'll definitely be repurchasing this one, though. It does exactly what it's advertised to do, and it does it *very* well. I'm super happy with how well this impulse buy worked out.\n\n(ﾉ ^ ヮ ^ )ﾉ✧:・ﾟ✧  **4/5** Would definitely repurchase!   ",

It's not anyone's fault, and neither does a product description of \"for all skin types\" help. Lately, I've been more mindful of trying out products more geared for my super oily skin. Based on your flair, you're pretty much my skin twin, so thank you again for this review and recommendation!",

The texture is fantastic. The fragrance isn't off-putting either. A very good moisturizer but the only con is, it doesn't nourish my skin just hydrates if ykwim? It gets absorbed fast and my skin feels dry after it does. I think I would prefer this for intense summer like June? But yes I do use this when I have to write after moisturizing so that the pen doesn't slip and this is nice if I want hydration but isn't good for intense moisturization. Overall I love it but the moisturization is meh but the hydration is 😍😍.  Would I repurchase it? Absolutely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Product name*: **Dove Cooling Gel Crème (Cream)** \n\n*Price :* Starts from around Rs 180(?), usually on sale easily available in nykaa, pharmacies and normal departmental stores. \n\n*Ingredient List:* Water, Glycerin, Dimethicone O, Isopropyl Palmitate, Petrolatum, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil , Carbomer, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide , Benzophenone-4 Disodium EDTA Menthol, FragranceCitral, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool, Ci 42090\n\n*Experience and opinion: Okay I will come out and say it, this is a little better than the ponds one just for body moisturizer, well ofc it's made for moisturization but ykwim? In my condition, this works well. Does exactly what it claims, cools. Feels nice on the skin, good fragrance, great texture, and good hydration. I won't say intense moisturization but it's great IMO and doesn't make me sweat so IDK what's better hehe. It is really good if you want a nice summer moisturizer that makes your skin soft and doesn't feel chip chip and hydrates.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Comparison***: both of them are really good moisturizers and have their plus points but I like the dove one more for body moisturization. The ponds one isn't as long-lasting as the dove either. Overall verdict, the dove is better than ponds for moisturization, maybe because it is a cream, not a gel but if you have a condition like me you will prefer this more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay I know this can be an unnecessary post but I wanted to really post this comparison IDK why and yeah here it is, please be nice omg and don't call me out and say IDK anything coz I'm actually anxious about that happening haha xD okay lol, enough Rona. \n\nHope this helps anyone who had this doubt \n\nlove you<3",

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down\n\nThat's because silicones are not the devil that cg hair community paints them out to be... Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

    "body": "I wanted to share my thoughts after buying and testing two bottles of the Global Beauty Care Shimmering Body Oil, one with Pineapple & Glycolic Acid and one with Coconut & Polyglutamic Acid. \n\nObservations:\n* They come with a safety seal, but one of the bottles had a punctured seal. This is just my reminder to check the seal before you leave the store. \n* The first two ingredients are glycerin and water (pic 4). There is very little oil in these, if any (the coconut one has a small amount of coconut oil). PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil is polyethylene glycol derived from castor oil and often used in cosmetic products as an emulsifier and emollient. This feels more like a gel on the skin, and left my arms stick rather than oily. \n* There's no visual difference in color between the two bottles' shimmer when you apply it to the skin. I wouldn't consider this a shimmer either, more like visible glitter pieces (pics 2 and 3). \n* Both products smelled nice, but the fragrance did not last very long. \n* After applying to my skin and massaging it on, my hand had more glitter on it than where I applied it. \n* I did not use these long enough to observe any benefits from the actives listed on the front, but based on ingredient order it is likely that there's not enough of any of them to be effective, and in my own opinion I wouldn't seek these out for the acids and retinol. If I'm going in the sun to show off the shimmer, I don't want potentially photosensitizing ingredients in the shimmer product. Sunscreen is a must with these types of actives. \n\nBuy it if:\n* You're a fan of glitter gels a la 1990s\n* You don't mind sticky texture\n* You're OK with glitter getting everywhere\n\nSkip it if:\n* You want subtle sheen or body oil\n* You want the benefits of the active ingredients\n* You have texture sensitivities\n\nAlternatives\n* Mix a hefty squeeze from a liquid highlighter (like the LA Colors one from this week's Anti Haul post) or bronzer (like the bpure bronzer drops) with a dollop of body oil (like the Personal Care vitamin E or coconut oils) and apply\n* Generously apply a highlighter stick to the area (like the bpure highlighter sticks) and then massage it into the skin with an oil like the ones mentioned above\n\nVerdict:\nThese aren't for me, but I can see the appeal of them. So I'll be giving one away to a friend who can use it, and tossing the one that came opened. ",

Butylene Glycol, Haematococcus Pluvialis Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Laminaria extract, Carnitine, Ubiquinone, Collagen, Sodium acetylhyaluronate, Rose Hip Oil, Glyceryl Tricaprylate-caprate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Octanediol*\n\n**Product smell, texture & finish:** Lightly scented, viscous fluid that finishes dewy and a bit sticky.\n\n**Product effects compared to claims:** I can't speak for any anti aging clams, since that was not one of my goals, but for hydration it does okay. I haven't noticed any significant changes in my skin since starting to use it. No significant plumping, and hydration wise, I've also noticed minimal effect.\n\n**Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products:** It's a hydrating lotion, so for me it comes right after double cleansing. It does not help with the absorption of other products, it does however make sticky products even stickier since it itself is a viscous, almost slimy feeling fluid. It absorbs much slower than some other lotions I've used in the past.\n\n**How long it has been used for:** Approx. 4 weeks\n\n**Has it been/will it be repurchased:** No, I will be trying other products.\n\n**Concluding remarks:** Overall, it filled a step in my routine as I was waiting for another lotion to come, but I feel that it does not deliver any particular effect in regards to plumping and even hydration. It was just... okay.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Review no.2*\n\n**Full Product Name:** Meishoku Ceracolla Super Moist Lotion\n\n**Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate:** Combo/Fair Olive/Hot & Humid\n\n**Reason for Use:**Hydration & plumping\n\n**Product Size & Price:** [180ml/11,12€](https://www.amazon.de/Ceracolla-Skin-Lotion-180ml-Super/dp/B00IJSWSBE/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499675589&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=meishoku+ceracolla)\n\n**Packaging:** Drip bottle, very precise. You can easily measure out droplets to evade wasting product.\n\n**Ingredients:** (according to Cosdna)\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene glycol, Methyl gluceth-10, PEG-75, Ceramide, Ceramide 3, CERAMIDE 6 II, Hydrolyzed collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium chloride, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben*\n\n**Product smell, texture & finish:** Scented fluid, ever-so-slightly viscous. Smells like a baby-oriented product, I find it very pleasant.\n\n**Product effects compared to claims:** Quite nice, I've noticed a few changes in hydration levels since starting its use. My skin also appears slightly plumper.\n\n**Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products:** Another hydration lotion which comes right after double cleansing. It's a thin liquid that absorbs fairly easily and does not leave my skin feeling sticky unless I use it for the 3/7 skin method. \n\n**How long it has been used for:** 1 month\n\n**Has it been/will it be repurchased:** Yes, most likely, although I will continue searching for better products. This will work nicely as a secondary hydrating lotion (yes, I'm a product hoarder).\n\n**Concluding remarks:** Very pleasant and affordable. I particularly enjoy the fact that the liquid is not *too* viscous - it stands somewhere in the golden middle, which leaves my skin feeling nice and supple. Its effects have been no where near remarkable, but it is a reliable product for bringing in that extra hydration.\n\n\n\n*Note: I've also posted this in the review section in r/abdiscussion for the audience there. :)*\n",

    "body": "[Product Picture 🖼 https://imgur.com/a/CTKGFVJ] \n\nF/26\nClimate - North India. Hot in summers, goes low to about 10°c in winters. But I mostly stay indoors in AC environment so moot point. \n\nCurrent Skin Type - Combination, Acneic. Sensitive to some natural & specific ingredients, resilient to most actives.\n\nPrice : ₹350 for 50ml ; but you can always find it on discount. \n\nIngredients List :- Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Propanol-2, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Capryloyl Glycine, Allantoin, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium Ascorbate, Tocopherol and Retinol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Disodium EDTA, Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca Alternifolia) Leaf Oil.\n\nIt's got 1.5%Salicylic Acid as the active ingredient afaik. \n\nHas hydrating & soothing ingredients like aloe juice, panthenol & allantoin, tocopherol (Vit E) as antioxidant & emollient, hydrogenated castor oil which makes mists moisturizing. Sodium ascorbate helps in brightening skin & Retinol the superstar which exfoliates, smoothens skin & also helps treat acne. TTO - which is a potent anti acne spot treatment on its own as its anti microbial & anti bacterial. Together all these ingredients make for a wonderful cocktail for skin. \n\nIt's marketed for the body but I used it on my face as the percentage is not high. \n\nViscosity - Thin watery with slight oil slick feeling. Biphased micellar water type texture. \n\nLet me preface this by saying I used Salyzap Spray everyday twice a day for 1.5 years, sometimes I even used it thrice a day in case of painful pimples ; & my facial skin type used to be OILY all over. The product feels just as non oily as it did a year ago, no dryness or extra oiliness. So I'd say it's a product that suits all skin types. \n\nThe spray from the nozzle isn't fine, but it's not a harsh squirt either. It sprays in the diameter of a 10g silver coin,not wider than that. If I spray it very close to skin I can reduce the spray size to area of about 1 finger tip unit. \n\nI love this product. *Holy Grail. WRP* . Its so cheap & works so well & a lot easier to incorporate into my routine compared to spot treatment gels or clay masks. \n\nI use about 4 to 5 sprays for my whole face. \n\nThe Salyzap Spray reduces the size of whitehead to half in 1 use, pustules in 2 uses, & they'll be gone in 3 uses. \n\nWith regular usage my blackheads disappeared & they don't occur anymore. \n\nIt doesn't work on papules but it does work on cystic acne to some extent. After regular usage they flatten out on their own. They don't erupt & come to a head so I'm saved the trouble of dealing with PIH as aftermath. \n\nI believe the retinol helps in evening out skin texture &and the sodium ascorbate (a mineral salt of vitamin C) helps in lightening the acne marks. My pimples don't scar or leave less severe dark marks behind compared to other acne treatment products I have used. \nIt also helps in reducing pimple size so there's smaller area to deal with later. I think it's because of the retinol. \n\nBefore using Salyzap spray I used to use Tea tree oil from The Body Shop combined with a salicylic acid spot treatment gel & another anti acne gel moisturizer from Tvakh to keep my pimples at bay. Now as I use this I've cut down acne management into just 1 step. So convenient 😍 \n\nI love this. If you aren't sensitive to tea tree oil then buy it eyes closed. It works great & is so inexpensive & great value for money at ₹350 for 50ml. \n\nI'd go as far as saying its better than PC BHA. I have the PC BHA & it's very gentle & works quite slow compared to this. Salyzap is like a SOS, where as PC is more like daily mild treatment, despite the fact it has 2% SA.\n\nIf you're looking for a leave on BHA exfoliant or spot treatment I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SALYZAP SPRAY.",

I enjoyed this product a lot more. \n\nI was going to stick to this until I came across an influencer post talking about oxidization where I commented about the colour of this product, & the influencer replied saying it’s wrong. I know, I know, we are not supposed to believe everything they say, but still it raised a doubt in my head enough for me to check their website & their IG page, wherein, the texture shots for this product shows a clear & transparent liquid.\n\nYou can imagine my confusion & worry, coz here I was using that product every day that it was nearly empty thinking it’s okay, but then also wondering why didn’t it bring out any reaction, instead it made my skin better. I DM’ed their IG page with images asking for clarification, and their reply was this:\n\n_The product contains Ferulic Acid & Fullerenes that have the property to impart light yellowish color to their formulation. The colour is not an indication of any type of degradation. The degradation is signified by dark orange/brown color. Their Vitamin C serum is a stabilized Vitamin C derivative, which is further stabilized by Ferulic Acid & Vitamin E._\n\nI'm confused here coz (1) If the colour is meant to be yellow, why put texture shots with transparent colour liquid? and (2) Pigmentation got very less on using this product, so I'm guessing the product does work, but it does raise question on the credibility. \n\n**Repurchase:** Will research more and if all is clear, I see myself returning to this Serum for sure.\n\nUpdate:\nTurns out the light yellow colour of their formulation is due to Ferulic Acid, and not due to oxidisation. So as per the site, it's safe to use. I am on my second bottle now.",

I take good care of my serums, keeping them in the dark and always tightening the bottle immediately. So I guess it is supposed to be light yellow, but I agree with your point that why then it is portrayed as transparent in their ads and website. Minimalist should come clear on this. \n\nAbout the efficiency of the product- I love it! My skin has cleared up and it has helped me with uneven pigmentation too. The face looks much more bright. So I'm definitely going to re- purchase. However, I use it with their niacinamide serum, with me alternating vitamin c  and niacinamide everyday.",

Aldi replaced it with Formic Acid for which CosDNA has no irritant/acne score, but did replace Laureth-10 with Laureth-4 which is worse according to CosDNA (but it’s very low on the ingredients list). \n\nAldi foaming wash has added Lactic Acid lower down on the list (Moisturising in low concentrations).\n\nBoth kinds of Aldi wash have added Glycerin.\n\nAt first glance, Aldi improved their face wash while Simple made theirs possibly slightly worse. \n\nAll product images here https://imgur.com/a/Y2qE1LZ",

[It's now finally up on the website](https://www.superdrug.com/search?text=calm+skin), meaning I can post about it without having to type out all the ingredients by hand ;)\n\nThe range has a night mask, a facial oil, a cleanser, a 'rescue gel', a hydrating spray and a 2-in-1 serum/moisturiser. They're all £2.99, and they're all on buy 1 get 1 half price. I bought 4 products - the mask, the rescue gel, the spray and the serum/moisturiser. I skipped on the cleanser, as it has SLS, and I couldn't be bothered with the oil at the time, especially since I wanted even numbers because of the offer. \n\nI also emailed Superdrug's customer support to enquire about the % of niacinamide, as I was worried it would be insufficient. After some back-and-forth, the customer service rep contacted the new product team and got this response:\n\n\"I cannot give out specific information regarding our formulations but I can confirm that the percentage of niacinamide is >5% in all of the below.\"\n\nThe below being the four products I was asking about, I imagine. (The oil doesn't have niacinamide, btw - it's only soluble in water)\n\nAnyway, nice!\n\nAfter a month or so of testing on and off, here's my mini reviews of the ones that I got:\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin De-Stress Refreshing Facial Spritz 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-De-Stress-Refreshing-Facial-Spritz-100ml/p/741142)**\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Bisabolol, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Moisturising spray? It's kind of weird. There's a slight oiliness to it, and a definite stickiness which is probably the large amount of glycerin. \n\n**Scent:** Definitely floral, vaguely chamomile-y\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, this is... a bit weird? I've mostly been using it as a hydrating toner. The difficulty is that it plays nice with some serums/moisturisers, but with others it seems to lead to bobbling. But I am rather bobble-prone, so it might just be me. Anyway, if I can get it to go on okay it definitely makes me feel more hydrated, particularly when I'm in the dry-aired office I keep complaining about. One day I was feeling kinda bored so I tried out the '7 skin' method by spraying it on every few minutes until it wouldn't absorb any more. I think I got to about six? It definitely hydrated my skin! And probably calmed it down as well. Is it a bad idea to put so much niacinamide on your skin? I don't know, but it's unlikely I'm going to be doing this on a regular basis.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Well, it's a very cheap, very hydrating toner, so probably.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Hydrating 2in1 Serum & Moisturiser 50ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Face-Cream/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Hydrating-2in1-Serum-%26-Moisturiser-50ml/p/741125)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide, ‭Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Polyacrylamide, Butylene Glycol, ‭Phenoxyethanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethiconol, Parfum, Betaine, Laureth-7, ‭Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, ‭Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa ‭Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower ‭Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, ‭Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** So siliconey it's vaguely unnerving\n\n**Scent:** Heady floral, not unpleasant but kinda odd to find in this context. It's not at all chamomile-like? More of a tuberose, kinda luxe-y but definitely not one for people who don't like heavy scent\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, I think the reason it's described as a 2-in-1 is that there's SO MUCH SILICONE you really can't use much else with it or it will turn into a peeling gel, which is what it did to me several times. I think it might be a good thing for me in the summer when I need something very light, but right now I want to use a heavier, more wintery moisturiser and to layer stuff and this isn't meant for that at allll\n\n**Will I repurchase?** I don't know, let me try it out in the summer and see if I can find a sunscreen that'll play nice with it.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Rescue Gel 15ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Rescue-Gel-15ml/p/741146)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Allantoin, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile)Flower Extract, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gel\n\n**Scent:** Alcohol\n\n**Overall Experience:** Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot?\nI did actually try this a couple of times and it did nothing much, which honestly is better than I should have expected, by rights it should have made my face fall off.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Nope\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Overnight Face Mask 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Overnight-Face-Mask-100ml/p/741143)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, ‭Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Prunus ‭Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, ‭Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Parfum, Sodium ‭Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, ‭Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Isohexadecane, C13-14 ‭Isoparaffin, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Bisabolol, ‭Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate ‭(Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sorbitan ‭Oleate, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, ‭Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium ‭Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gloop. Sinks in pretty quickly.\n\n**Scent:** Light floral\n\n**Overall Experience:** Help, I really like this. It goes on nicely even over other stuff (eg Scinic Honey AIO), is nice and occlusive, smells okay and - the kicker - actually leaves my skin looking better in the morning, with red marks noticeably diminished. My only complaint is that it's tiny, considering you'll want to use a hefty glop of the stuff.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Almost certainly",

Niacinamide isn't necessarily irritating in higher pH products, otherwise the vast majority of skincare products with niacinamide would be irritating, since most products aren't formulated at <pH 4.5. Alcohol denat. is a penetration enhancer and many people don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, particularly if their skin is in good condition to begin with and/or if they don't have alcohol in every single product. Citric acid is a pH adjuster. It's almost impossible just by looking at an ingredient list to be able to talk at length about the overall formula, and none of these ingredients in a normal product are 'face falling off' level of concern. Thanks for sharing these products!",

    "body": "Hi all! I have recently gathered all the info on Salicylic Acid that I have in my personal knowledge base and decided to publish it as a guidelines that can be referenced in the future.\n\nI decided to do this because question about Salicylic Acid appear from time to time in the sub and I also see some wrong information from YouTube videos when people are trying to formulate it. Hope this information would be helpful for you!\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI AM NOT A CHEMIST!\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR!\n\nI DON'T HAVE ANY SKINCARE, CHEMISTRY, MEDICAL OR BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION!\n\nAll the information is gathered over the internet sources and some is referenced (+ a bit of personal DIY experience). I am open to any corrections and additions. Please leave them in comments and I'll include them in this article.\n\n# General info\n\n>**BE CAUTIOS! IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO ASPIRIN THEN YOU MOST LIKELY HAVE ALLERGY TO SALICYLIC ACID**\n\n**INCI:** Salicylic Acid  \n**Type:** Acid, BHA  \n**Functions:** Exfoliation, Anti-inflammatory  \n**Treats:** Acne, Blackheads, Keratosis Pilaris, Sebum production  \n**Usage rate:** 0.5 - 3.0%  \n**Usable pH range:** 3.5  \n**pKa:** 2.97  \n**Solubility:** Alcohols, Glycols, Oils, Surfactants  \n**Molar mass:** 138.121 g/mol (Daltons)\n\n# Usage rate\n\nDue to possible poisoning, based on European regulations ([SCCS - Final Opinion on Salicylic acid](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/sccs-final-opinion-salicylic-acid-2023-06-09_en)) maximum usage rates of Salicylic Acid in skincare products are:\n\n* 3% in wash-off hair products;\n* 2% in other leave-on products, excluding the mentioned below;\n* 0.5% for body lotions, eye shadows, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, oral products and non-spray deodorants.\n\n>**!DANGER!**  \nBetter to avoid formulating sprayable products due to possible inhalation. Also, special attention is required for the use of SA in eye products, as it shows potential of causing serious damage to eyes.\n\nUSA most likely has the same regulation on SA. It is also an OTC drug in USA and should be labeled in a special section of the product packaging.\n\nSouth Korea has even stricter rules for direct SA. The maximum usage rate is up to 0.5% for any product type ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2d613u/maximum_bha_in_korea_05/)). That's why Korean skincare products often use **Willow Bark Extract** and/or **Betaine Salicylate** as active ingredient instead.\n\n# Solubility\n\n# Water\n\nAlthough Salicylic Acid is a polar molecule it is poorly soluble in water (which is also a polar molecule), because the polar parts of the molecule attached to the bigger non-polar part of it, affecting the properties. ([Chemical Book](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/the-polar-and-non-polar-characteristics-in-the-structure-of-salicylic-acid.htm)).\n\n# Depending on temperature\n\nSolubility in water depending on the temperature ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid)):\n\n|Water temperature (°C)|Solubility (g/L)|Solubility (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0|1.24|0.124|\n|25|2.48|0.248|\n|40|4.14|0.414|\n|75|17.41|1.741|\n|100|77.79|7.779|\n\nWhich means if you take 100ml of water under room temperature (25 °C) you can dissolve up to 0.248g of SA in it. If you boil the water it will take up to 7.779g of SA, but precipitates when you cool the solution down.\n\n# Depending on pH\n\nSolubility increases with increasing pH, because part of SA becomes \"neutralized\" and therefore more soluble in water. Can be estimated for any given pH using the pKa of Salicylic Acid:\n\n* At a pH of 2.97 (pKa): 50% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form\n* At a pH of 4: 90% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form.\n* At a pH of 5: about 99% is in \"neutralized\" form.\n\nHere is a free acid calculator (not only for BHA) at any pH level: [LabMuffin Beauty](https://labmuffin.com/free-acid-calculator-for-exfoliants-at-specific-ph-levels/). WIth this spreadsheet you can calculate how much Salicylic Acid will be in protonated form (not neutralized, free acid) under any pH.\n\n# Betaine\n\nDue to strict regulation of SA in Korea and high popularity of Korean skincare products, new ingredient has been researched and introduced as a gentler alternative to SA called **Betaine Salicylate**.\n\nBetaine forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with Salicylic Acid rather than a salt, which increases its solubility. Formulated with it at pH 3.0-3.5, with a 2:1 molar ratio (1.7g to 1g) of Betaine to Salicylic Acid and it remains relatively soluble. Betaine mixed with Salicylic Acid at the right proportion results in a liquid ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/do-sodium-citrate-or-betaine-react-with-salicylic-acid/)).\n\n# Surfactants\n\nGreat solubility in many surfactants, especially the ones that start with \"Sodium\" (Sodium Laureth Sulfate etc). That's why formulating a face wash or shampoo with Salicylic Acid is not a big problem and won't be covered here.\n\nAccording to [\"The solubilization of salicylic acid by a series of non-ionic surfactants\"](https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-abstract/23/Supplement_1/241S/6200573) the likely mechanism is somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation.\n\nBased on [\"Solubilization of Salicylic Acid by Polysorbate 80 as Determined by Solubility Titration\"](https://jpharmsci.org/article/S0022-3549(15)33858-2/abstract), to completely solubilize SA in water the ratio between SA and:\n\n* **Polysorbate 80** should be 0.15\n* **Polysorbate 20** should be 0.13\n\nTherefore to solubilize 2% of SA in water required around 13.4% of Polysorbate 80 or around 15.4% of Polysorbate 20.\n\n# Ethanol (Alcohol)\n\nSalicylic Acid is highly soluble in **Ethanol**, that's why many companies use Ethanol as a main solvent or a co-solvent of the product.\n\nUnder normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg Ethanol, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Propylene glycol\n\n**Propylene Glycol** is often used as a solvent and penetration enhancer in skincare formulations. Solubility rate of SA in Propylene Glycol is 248.63 g/L or 257.64 g/kg Propylene Glycol, which means 25.76g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Propylene Glycol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Sodium Citrate and Sodium Lactate\n\n**Sodium Citrate** and **Sodium Lactate** are salts of weak Citric Acid and Lactic Acid respectfully. Since SA is a stronger acid, when mixed it can replace Citric or Lactic acid and gives **Sodium Salicylate**, which is highly soluble in water:\n\n>Sodium Citrate + Salicylic Acid -> Sodium Citrate + Sodium Salicylate + Citric Acid + Salicylic Acid\n\nMentioned salts are not usable as solubilization enhancers since they basically neutralize SA, but they are good buffering agents to prevent SA recrystallization in case of pH drift or temperature change.\n\nSuggested ratio of salt to SA is 1:10 ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/precipitation-and-gel-incompatibility-salicylic-acid-serum/)), meaning for 2% of Salicylic Acid include 0.2% of the buffer.\n\n# Mixed solvency approach\n\nAccording to [Hydrotropy, mixed hydrotropy, and mixed solvency as trending concept for solubilization of lipophilic drugs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128144558000050) and [\"Mixed-solvency approach\" - Boon for solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44298504_Mixed-solvency_approach_-_Boon_for_solubilization_of_poorly_water-soluble_drugs), a mix of different solvents usually gives better solubility than if one pure solvent is used of the same content. This allows to decrease the content of each individual solvent in the formula leading to a more elegant product.\n\nSolubility in mixes of Water, Propylene Glycol and Ethanol was studied in [Solubility prediction of Salicylic Acid in Water-Ethanol-Propylene Glycol mixtures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16649546/). The study defined a formula to determine how much Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in a custom mixture of this solvents and also proves mixed solvency approach.\n\nHere is a calculator spreadsheet that I made based on the study: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqJaMGAa1Wu3BKck55dkqUWt4ACU_FPo). Fill in percentage of Ethanol and Propylene Glycol in the mixture (water will be calculated automatically) and you'll see the solubility calculated.\n\n# Substitutions\n\nThere are alternative ingredients that are readily soluble in water and can be used to avoid the hassle with Salicylic Acid itself:\n\n* **Sodium Salicylate**. Salt of Salicylic Acid. Very soluble in water. There is a publication in cosmetic journal ([Exfoliation for sensitive skin with neutralized salicylic acid](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x)) showing that Sodium Salicylate is as effective as actual Salicylic Acid in terms of exfoliation. But the methodology of studies are not disclosed and anti-acne effect is not tested. Used in [Revox Just Salicylic Acid 2% For Scalp](https://incidecoder.com/products/revox-just-salicylic-acid-2-for-scalp)  and [Keve Salicylic Acid 2% Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/keve-salicylic-acid-2-serum)\n* **WIllow Bark Extract**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Pyunkang Yul Acne Dressing Mask Pack](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-dressing-mask-pack);\n* **Betaine Salicylate**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Cos De BAHA S2 Salicylic Acid BHA 2% Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cos-de-baha-s2-salicylic-acid-bha-2-liquid);\n* **Salicylic Acid in Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine** solution. Used in [The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution)  and [Revolution 2% Salicylic Acid Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/revolution-2-salicylic-acid-serum);\n* Spray dried **Salicylic Acid with Acacia Senegal Gum**. Used in [Somethinc 2% BHA Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment](https://incidecoder.com/products/somethinc-2-bha-salicylic-acid-acne-treatment) and [Attivi Puri Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/attivi-puri-salicylic-acid-niacinamide-lotion)\n\n# Formulation strategy\n\nBased on the data above, the strategy of formulating a stable SA serum is:\n\n1. Formulate with not more than 2% of Salicylic Acid to meet requirements for skincare products;\n2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. At this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed);\n3. Use several solvents (glycols, ethanol) for better solubility based on mixed solvency approach;\n4. Include some mild non-ionic surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to form micelles and encapsulate part of the acid;\n5. Use Betaine to convert part of SA to Betaine Salicylate and adjust the pH;\n6. Add some weak acid salt (Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate) to prevent precipitation in case of pH drift or temperature change;\n7. Since our target is low pH, maybe Ethanol content and maybe high salt content be sure to use a tolerant gelling agent. Sepimax Zen, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose or HMW Hyaluronic acid are good choices, while Aristoflex, Carbomer, Lecigel won't thicken the solution.\n8. Avoid natural extracts (or add at 0.01% amount for marketing claims) and ingredients that in low pH will hydrolyze over time and shift the pH level up (Niacinamide, Urea etc).\n\n# Example of a commercial product\n\n[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n* Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n* Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n* Used Betaine as a hydrotrope tp boost the solubility;\n* Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\n# Example of formulas\n\n# Very basic waterless solution\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Propylene Glycol|98%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n\nThe easiest and fastest approach is to dissolve Salicylic Acid directly in Propylene Glycol.\n\nPros:\n\n* No water - no solubility and recrystallization problems;\n* No water - no pH;\n* No water - no need for preservation;\n* Easy and fast to prepare;\n* Damn strong since whole SA content is in free acid form.\n\nCons:\n\n* Unpleasant to wear, PG has very oily texture (can be balanced with Ethanol to some degree);\n* Runny texture, hard to thicken;\n* Damn strong. Yes, it is not a typo, this can be both - advantage and disadvantage.\n\n# Basic one-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Optional: preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Propylene Glycol|50%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n5. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nPreservative is optional because the formula has a lot of humectant (Propylene Glycol) that binds water and also low pH.\n\nUsed much more PG as required because no other co-solvents or buffering agents used, so higher amount is required to maintain the stability and prevent recrystallization of SA.\n\n# Basic two-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Ethanol|20%|\n|Propylene Glycol|20%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

[Essential Labs: How to Use Salicylic Acid Powder in a Serum](https://youtu.be/SI2GP7X3JKY) \\- although uses only ethanol as a solvent, shows good how Sodium Citrate can prevent recrystallization of Salicylic Acid;\n\nExample of suboptimal formulas:\n\n1. [PRIME SIDE: How to make 2% Salicylic acid serum](https://youtu.be/jfT3lBKyi6M) \\- formulated at pH 5-6, which means SA is completely neutralized and there is no acid in free form.\n2. [poshskin secrets: ow To Make DIY Skin Lightening Salicylic Acid Toner At Home](https://youtu.be/X6eA2PBv-ps) \\- Salicylic Acid is totally neutralized by baking soda and Sodium Citrate;\n3. [TaraLee: DIY Paulas Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant](https://youtu.be/LIubTz7QIW8) \\- too little of solvents, too high pH (because lower pH will lead to more free acid and recrystallization due to lack of solvents).\n4. [Cosmateur: DIY Salicylic Acid 2% Serum | 4 ingredients](https://youtu.be/RFBUwxkrkaU) \\- although the amount of solvents seems right, the formula is written in volumes, which means SA content is higher than 2% allowed (ethanol is lighter than water). Also, part of the ethanol evaporates during extensive mixing, so the concentration gets even higher. Moreover, the pH is not adjusted at all.\n\n# Community formulas\n\n* [Cleansing pads](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/vywxmu/super_simple_salicylic_acid_cleansing_pads/)\n* [Paula's Choice dupe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/jav3qq/i_made_a_2_salicylic_acid_toner_loosely_based_on/)",

        "body": "A great comprehensive view! I have a few comments/corrections/additions. Feel free to disregard them :)\n\n>Under normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nI would add \"**g/kg ethanol**\", otherwise this can be confused with g/kg solution (which is the more common use of the unit). \n\n>2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. Under this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed)\n\nAs you decrease pH, more acid will be in the free-acid form (that is, protonated). However, above pH 3.5, you'll reduce the amount of free acid (increase the ionized form). It should be updated to read \"**Above** this pH, if you add...\".\n\n>4. Include some mild surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to decrease surface tension and boost the solubility;\n\nI don't see that the article comments on the mechanism of solubilization. However, the likely mechanism would be somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation. Surfactants decreasing air-water interfacial surface tension is an intrinsic property of surfactants, and doesn't really pertain to boosting solubility. It's a nit-picky suggestion, but it's just because I work with surfactants.\n\n>[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n>1. Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n\n>2. Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n\n>3. Used Betaine as pH adjuster;\n\n>4. Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\nBetaine (also called N,N,N-trimethylglycine) isn't a pH adjuster because it's largely zwitterionic in solution, and has a pKa of around 2.33, and so won't be appreciably protonated (i.e. taking up protons to buffer the solution) until after you've protonated a >50% of the salicylic acid. However, triethanolamine is a pH adjuster, and will form a small amount of triethanolammonium salicylate (which does increase solubility, albeit by neutralization). \n\n  \nAll in all, a lot of great, helpful information! Thanks for putting this together!",

Why are you using a 10% solution of a strong alkali (sodium hydroxide) in your diy formulations instead of a weak acid (sodium citrate or sodium lactate)? \n\nFormulas DIY Nomenclature...\nWater is a solvent so is generally To 100 not q.s. like pH adjustment.\n\nThank you for sharing this.

    "body": "For me, it would be \n\n1. Oryza moisturiser-the ingredient list looks interesting and seems perfect for the dry winter months. I am a bit scared to use this,not gona lie, because of all the heavy ingredients, but winters tend to get very dry where my hostel is, hence I am going to go out on a limb and try this out. \n\n2. UV doux sunscreen-pretty self explanatory. This is one of the most raved about sunscreens right now. I am trying to hate pan my Lotus gloop (the damn thing refuses to finish wtf dude)\n\n3. Dermafique toner- i have checked out the ingredient list and it seems interesting (Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260). \n\nI am not big on toners, but seeing panthenol so high up on the ingredient list made me so happy. \n\n4. Aveeno dermexa emollient cream- although I have one body butter and a body lotion to finish up, I still want to go for this lotion solely for my hands and feet. My knuckles tend to get very dry(and sometimes bleed) during extreme dry winters and this looks like could help. \n\n5. Baidyanath/dabur almond oil- i always buy a bottle of almond oil before the winter begins. It is an amazing all purpose product. \n\n6. Sebamed foaming face wash- i am currently using cetaphil. I want to try out something else. No specific reason for choosing sebamed out of everything else. I am not fussy about facial cleansers. \n\n7. Fabindia charcoal face mask- I have used this one before and this cleared up my skin like no other. Fabindia's products are incredibly underrated. This is one Indian homegrown brand that I can fully get behind. I have used quite a few of their stuff and none disappointed me. \n\n8. Neutrogena lip balm with SPF15- no specific reason for choosing this one out of all. Just wanted to try out a lip balm with spf. \n\n9. Any one of nykaa's moi perfumes- I simply love perfumes. i have the one in black(can't remember the name). I want to try out more of their perfume line. I will stick to the minis for now. \n\nThat is all that I have in my wishlist for now! Share us yours!",

The finish of uv doux is good though but that’s pretty pointless for me if the protection isn’t. If you don’t mind the price I’d suggest the avene or isdin. Avene is more white cast and kind of thick. Isdin is cosmetically very elegant.

    "body": "Just a small review on a new little happy hitter in my pile! A few months ago I was buying some cream on iHerb and needed something to fill space for free shipping. At the time Coxir was on sale so I got it for $12.16. It had snail and that was enough to be a target. I kind of considered the brand to be a Cosrx knockoff, which it very well may be, or just have super similar packaging. But I absolutely did not take the purchase seriously and it sat on my shelf for a while. \n\nAbout a month ago I opened it and gave it a try. I’ve used it on and off since then, never quite committing until recently. Here’s what changed and what I think about the product!\n\nWhat changed: on a lark I decided to smear half my face with Coxir and the other half with Missha’s Misa Cho Gong Jin Toner (bigger review for later). I was shocked by how the Coxir immediately dimmed the redness on its side. It was very visible. It soaked in and bam: calmer skin. I have mild rosacea so calm skin is my battle. Calm skin in summer is like a war. \n\nUsing it more and for me, it’s just a really nice product. It’s thin but thickened enough that it’s not so watery it flows off your hand immediately. You can easily layer it. It doesn’t feel heavy on my skin; it’s barely noticeable. I really enjoy the scent which is very powder fresh to my nose. It’s just a nice simple easy to layer non-offensive toner (for me). I didn’t even look at the ingredients until now but they’re nice: (and kudos to Coxir for having them easily available on their website)\n\nSnail Secretion Filtrate, Water, Betula Alba Juice, Butylene glycol, Methyl Gluceth-20, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycoproteins, Betaine, Glycerin, Yeast Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Black Soybean Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Adenosine, Copper Tripeptide-1, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Parfum\n\nA lot of stuff I quite like and gravitate to normally. Because of this I’m going to be checking out some of their other stuff in the future. The Black Snail Collagen line has a few products and this has been more visibly valuable than several centella focused products I’ve used over my AB journey.",

The first time I used it, I broke out almost immediately. Still, to be fair, I gave it another chance… but nope, it was 100% the culprit behind the sudden breakout. 😭\n\nHow do I know for sure?\n\n1. It’s the only new product I added to my makeup routine.\n2. The breakouts appeared in places I don’t normally get pimples (like the sides of my face and around my mouth).\n3. I usually only get a few pimples on my forehead or chin around THAT time of the month (🩸), and I definitely wasn’t on my period, nor was I premenstrual.\n\nSo, a heads-up to my fellow acne-prone folks..this might not be the best choice for you! I’m guessing the PVP and/or PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil in the ingredients triggered my breakout (and perhaps the Niacinamide—which I already have sensitivity to—also contributed to the bad reaction). Proceed with caution! \n\nIn retrospect. I really should've checked the ingredients list first before making the purchase, but nabudol ako kasi naka super sale siya at the time. 🙃",

I slather it in my hands and then rub it on my damp face. In mx this is $88mxn-$108mxn (4.5 - 5.5 euro).\n\n[lasts a long time! I first purchased it in november and i still have and i use it daily in the mornings. ](https://preview.redd.it/a9vrp4jehxqa1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=387eb3c9c1b9118e522aa8d728ebe18f983dc1e2)\n\nTo target trouble areas, this is specifically for my seb dermatitis, my derm recommended me: **keroseb emulsion,** I'm pretty sure the brand is spanish HD cosmetic efficiency I think its called, this product was a bit more \"expensive\" but it lasts a long time, I purchased it in November and I think I still have a lot, it's a pump bottle so I don't know how much. It is heavily fragranced which confuses me given its for such sensitive skins, but I haven't had an issue (and fragranced tends to be an issue for me). I apply it after I cleanse on my trouble areas which for me are the sides of my nose and eyebrows and forehead. The ingredients are \\*Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Glycerin, Squalane, Cyclo- pentasiloxane, Pentylene Glycol, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Dimethicone, Piroctone Olamine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Biosaccharide Gum-2, Papain, Zinc Sulfate, Sodium Polyac- rylate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Proline, Alanine, Maltodextrin, Parfum (Fragrance), Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Calcium Pantothenate, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Urea, Magnesium Lactate, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Lactate, Magnesium Chloride, Serine, Sodium Citrate.\\*Is not completely fungal acne safe, but I find that it really soothes my skin if I'm having a flareup, if my skin is compromised in those areas this product will sting a little, and itch a tiny bit (nothing like finacea gel) as it is absorbed into the skin, but by the end of that same day is so much better! A little goes a long way, texture is like a gel cream, I don't find that it pills, and it doesn't flare my perioral dermatitis either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kly322wv04ra1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=312c2610e7c4a186e4e0988ba58b258c90063992\n\nFor the body: **Lactovit** another spanish brand, this is super cheap for me they have a cream that has a 10% complex of urea, lactic acid and retinol. It always kinda seems that the packaging comes half empty, but the package is just bigger, it's like 10 usd for 400ml, I use this for the body. It absorbs fast, it has fragrance but it smells nice to me, kind of powdery. They have a shower cleanser too which I use that really helps with ingrown hairs and KP.\n\n[version for the mex market](https://preview.redd.it/m80yerhqhxqa1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf8e228928a277467cbc0243e88294c486cd0489)\n\nTo protect: for spf I use the **Cetaphil liposomal lotion** which in the EU is the exact same as the Daylong Protect and Care spf 50+ (or Daylong extreme spf), I find this to be an excellent primer for makeup, it doesn't pill, it doesn't break me out, it doesn't have fragrance, it feels like it lasts all day, and also calms my skin.\n\nThat's it. For facial moisturizer I use a small American brand named Malezia, I absolutely swear by them but the shipping price can be hefty in international orders and so not sharing them here.\n\n\\*\\*I find several products of this routine to be quite affordable given the price they have in the Mexican market, I hope that's the same case for EU.\\*\\*  \nxx  \nedit: to add the correct lactovit cream  \nedit2: to remove the malezia link the only american brand i mentioned because it gave the main image to the post and seemed misleading.

Also, these are not cheap products.  One example is the **Rose & Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Toner by Fresh - $45 at Sephora.** The packaging is beautiful and with a brand name Fresh, you would assume that it is natural especially as Sephora marks it with their \"Clean at Sephora\" symbol which means \"**Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more. For the full list, check out the Ingredients tab.\"**\n\nSounds good right?  Yes, compared to other brands which do contain these but when you look at the full ingredient list on this toner product, there are still some to be cautious of:\n\nWater, Glycerin, **Butylene Glycol**, Rosa Centifolia Flower, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Rosa Multiflora Fruit Extract, Angelica Keiskei Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, **PEG-150**, **PPG-26-Buteth-26**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Citrate, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, **BHT,** **Parfum** (Fragrance), **Phenoxyethanol**, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\n*Butylene Glycol*  \\-  skin, lung and eye irritant; environmental toxin\n\n*Sodium hyaluronate* \\- naturally occurring but found in connective tissues such as cartilage, so if you are looking for a vegan product, this would be out!\n\n*PEG-150 -* polyethylene glycols are often contaminated with 1,4-Dioxane; suspected endocrine disruptor; linked to cancer in animals; skin and eye irritant.\n\n*PPG-26-Buteth-26 -* not much information on this one but another synthetic product I would rather not put on my skin, esp my face\n\n*PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil -* Pure castor oil is readily available, so why go for one that could be contaminated with toxins?\n\n*BHT* \\- synthetic preservative\n\n**Parfum** \\- this is actually the most concerning ingredient because not many people realize that the single word Parfum (or fragrance), is a mixture of synthetic chemicals (any combination of over 3000 chemicals used in the skincare industry to denote fragrance).  Of these chemicals, several are highly toxic.  Only choose a product that uses pure essential oils as additives, if you are truly looking for something natural.\n\n**Phenoxyethanol** \\- a synthetic preservative found in almost all skincare products that is an endocrine disruptor and carcinogen in animals\n\nIf you do a quick search online, you can find several diy formulations for skincare care toners that use very simple ingredients such as rose water, glycerin, pure aloe vera, and pure skin oils.  \n\nHope this helps others who scrutinize labels like I do!",

Phenoxyethanol's endocrine disrupting abilities are so small, especially in the usage rates used to cosmetics. Even if you use several products with it, it is unlikely to cause an issue.\n\nIn preservatives, I actually prefer parabens which are the most widely researched and safest preservatives in cosmetics. And before you tell me they can cause cancer, please do your research. They do not cause cancer and the one paraben that they 'thought could cause cancer in the horribly done study that everyone cites was taken off the market ages ago.\n\nAlso, methylparaben naturally occurs in blueberries. It's just mass produced synthetically. There are also numerous natural ingredients that can cause irritation and cancer. \n\nas someone who use to be very big on natural skin care, I really hope you do some more research and read more scientific studies. I still love natural skincare, but there is so much misinformation it's scary. People with fungal acne can't use a lot of natural ingredients and ingredients like dimethicone, mct oil (caprylyl/capryl triglycerides) and mineral oil help them greatly.\n\nWhat is natural has very different meanings to different people.

Ok.\nReview time~!\n\n\n**Product Info:**\n\nShara Shara\n\nHoney Bomb All In One Ampoule\n\n250ml\n\n**Claims:**\n\n* Combines three steps (toner, serum and moisturizer)\n\n* Hydrates\n\n* Improves skin texture\n\n* Whitening (brightening)\n\n* Anti-aging\n\n[Ingredients:](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_0e10177275.html) (CosDNA link)\nWater, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Diglycerin, Betaine, Pentylene Glycol, Polyquaternium-51, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Propolis Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Pueraria Thunbergiana Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Paeonia Lactiflora Root Extract, Cnidium Officinale Root Extract, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Hamamelis Virginiana Flower Water, Soluble Collagen, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated Starch, Hydrolysate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Xanthan Gum, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Disodium Edta, Caramel, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Acacia Senegal Gum, Folic Acid, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol, Raffinose\n\n**Results:**\n\nI normally have dehydrated, dry and very dull skin around this time of year. I have quite a bit of products that help with that and they do help don't get me wrong, but this baby? Whew~! It adds quite a glow to the skin regardless of how I use it. When I do use it as a mask or sleeping pack I do wake up with a bit more hydration than just slapping it on, but that is expected. As I stated, I've been using this since November and I've barely scratched the surface! Luckily I have 12 months to use this! I've soaked cottons in this and given them to my mom (she has super dull skin) and now she expects them every time I visit -.-\n\nI can't say much on anti-aging as I don't have really fine lines or wrinkles yet (YET), but I can say it definitely hydrates and brightens the skin. It definitely helps when I'm in such a rush to get out the door but don't want to leave my skin dry all day~! \n\nI also put mine in the fridge as I've mentioned and man oh man does it help to not only add a glow to my face but the cooling helps waken my tired eyes up!\n\n**Pros:**\n\nHydrates\n\nBrightens skin\n\nCan be used in quite a few ways\n\nTONS of product\n\nNo heavy scent\n\nFeels light on skin\n\n**Cons:**\n\n$40 could be a bit pricey to some\n\nOnly the ingredients are in English",

You can see the image of a jar spilling out the the cream to make the shape of a face or a face mask.\nThe back packaging has some some of its instructions printed in both Korean and also English with pictures on how to use the mask properly.\nThe ingredients were also stated at the back along with the expiration date.\n\nREVIEW:\nThe sheet itself was protected between two layers of film and divided into two parts, the upper part and lower part which was quite convenient to use.\nInstead of the clear essence/serum, it has a white gel-like cream with a thicker consistency than the typical essence in sheet masks.\nThis mask felt cooling on my skin and it did indeed soothe the redness and calming those zits on my face.\nThe after effect left my skin looking clear and moisturized. It gives me that healthy and radiant glow to my skin. I almost resisted putting on a moisturizer and night cream due to the moistness it provided to my face.\nHowever, the effect only lasted for 2-3 days but I'm sure with constant use, my skin will continue to improve.\n\nOVERALL:\nThis mask evened out my skin tone and made my face look plump. It also deeply moisturized my skin and provides a cooling sensation to it. The mask is good for pampering yourself after having a hectic day, preferably during night time. I recommend this mask to anyone with dry skin and also to those looking for a 2-in-1 mask (soothing+hydrating).\n\nRATING:\n8/10",

I won't list the product here. (No changes in his medications)I'm listing the product ingredients and want to know what could possibly the reason for actual hairgrowth from people who know it better. There seems to be no Minox in there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \"Skrzypovita Serum Pro\", because of all the downvotes here you have it holy xd\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story is below the Ingredients. It's the same Ingredient order as on the package.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Propanediol, Arginine, Lactic Acid, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycerin, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Lamium Album Extract, Salvia Officinalis Leaf Extract, Pinus Sylvestris Bud Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Extract, Arctium Majus Root Extract, Citrus Limon Peel Extract, Hedera Helix Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tropaeolum Majus Flower Extract, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract, Betula Alba Leaf Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Actinidia Chinensis Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus Fruit Extract, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Biotin, Glycoproteins, Ethoxydiglycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pyridoxine HCI, Panthenol, Zinc Chloride, Acetyl Cysteine, Glutamine, Methionine, Saccharomyces Lysate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylalycerin. Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Lactate\n\nSo my Dad is 90% bald on the top with little small hair in the crownarea and some on the front between the temples. Huge donorarea tho. He has been like this for the last 20 years. But somehow he just noticed like a year ago that he went bald lol when I complained about my own hair. Even his ID 10 years ago shows him being in the same state as he is now.So he bought some random shampoo's and gave up on them. But he keeps using a \"serum\" which is just advertised in my land. And two weeks ago he said, \"my hair is getting back\" and my Mom agreed that he is really growing some hairs.I ignored it knowing how hard it actually is to get it back after spending thousand of hours reading about hairloss.But I remember checking his scalp from time to time, just cuz fkit I'm balding and wanted to see what I will end up with ok xd. And he is getting more hairs, his crownarea is of course thin af, but there are more hairs then some months ago.The package of the product says the same thing that we know from Minox. \"Takes 2-4months of use to see any difference and that it puts hairs into the anagen phase and keeps them there for longer period of time. Reduces hairloss up to 60%\"But there is no minox in here so what could be the reason it's doing any work?\n\nI buzzed my hair yesterday, thinking to try it out cuz I've lost the fight anyway. But I don't want to put something up there when I've no idea what it is for the rest of my days.",

    "body": "**Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\nWell, I think it has finally happened…I’m officially out of my sunscreen rut LOL! I had such a good experience with the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence last month…and this product from Troiareuke is another really nice chemical (and a bit of physical) sunscreen.\n\nIf I thought the lightweight feel of the Soft Airy UV Essence was special…this sunscreen from Troiareuke goes a step further. This formula is one of the thinnest and most lightweight feeling sunscreens I have used! And, considering this is a denatured/drying alcohol free formula…it’s kind of incredible. I’ve only felt this type of watery consistency with some Japanese sunscreens that are usually heavy on the Alcohol Denat. \n\nInactive ingredients include various texturizes, stabilizers, and silicones followed by fragrance (yeah…we will get there). Aloe Leaf Juice, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Centella Asiatica can also be found in this formula. Active ingredients include some fairly common chemical sunscreen filters (at least for K-Beauty)…but Titanium Dioxide in a rather small 1.49% makes an appearance as well. To be honest, the extracts and ingredients following fragrance were kind of lost on me. I didn’t see any soothing or exceptionally hydrating result from this product. But, I was really here for the feel and protection…so no hard feelings there. \n\nOkay, going back to the scent LOL! This product has a rather strong and slightly lingering clean/floral/powdery scent…and I do not like it. Similar to my one complaint about the Troiareuke ACSEN Pore Control Mask…I have no idea why the brand chose to add fragrance to a line geared towards acne prone/sensitive skin. Because of the texture and result this sunscreen still falls into my “love it” category. But, it would have been so much more amazing to me had Troiareuke omitted the scent.\n\nApplication of this product is pretty straightforward…just slather it on LOL! But, the silicones really help this sunscreen to spread around and distribute super evenly. I was never left worried that I missed a spot as everything glides and smoothes around the nose and chin. The little bit of Titanium Dioxide does leave behind the slightest of white-cast…but it absorbs/disappears within seconds and was actually helpful to see where I might need a bit more product. I never thought I would refer to physical filters in a sunscreen as being “beneficial” (at least for my darker skin tone)…but here we are LOL!\n\nOnce absorbed, this product leaves a VERY dewy and slightly shiny look behind. I know a lot of people (including my oily/combination skin peeps) might not like this “nearly greasy” feel/look…but I really love the ultra-dewy result. It might not be something I appreciate as much in the hotter months. The high amount of silicones helped to create this effect without the literal “grease” feeling though. Plus, they are a decent occlusives and help to hold in the hydration from toners/essences/lotions. I’ve used this product multiple times a day for the past couple fo weeks with no breakouts or excessively clogged pores.\n\nIn fact…this sunscreen provided a slight “pore blurring” effect (thanks silicones) much like the ACSEN Pore Control Mask. In it’s ability to mask larger pores and create a more even looking texture…the ACSEN line from Troiareuke has really wowed me so far. \n\nProtection was just fine when using the Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. Even though I am used to using products with a PA Rating of “++++”…I didn’t see any increase in redness or darkening of my skin with this PA+++ product. I feel like the Titanium Dioxide in this product helped to “reflect” and dissipate a bit more rays causing me to feel slightly more cool/comfortable in the sun. This benefit was really minimal to be honest but it was something I did notice.\n\nSo, overall…a really good sunscreen. Aside, from the fragrance this product was a total win. But, it is most likely something I won’t be coming back to and would probably NEVER be a sunscreen I would recommend. GASP…such a change of heart. Here’s why…\n\nThe Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence…in all of it’s 50ml…is priced at $55.00 USD on Soko Glam as well as the majority of sellers I looked up. Rarely does this sunscreen go on sale and if so the discounts are minimal. To me, this is simply too expensive for a sunscreen of this size. \n\nIt honestly frustrates and saddens me to see a sunscreen product this good be priced at such a prohibitive price point. I am a firm believer that sunscreen is the number one most important step in an effective skincare routine…but something at this cost excludes so many potential buyers. I would hate for someone to take a look at this product and say “Nope! I guess a good sunscreen is just too much for me…and the less expensive ones don’t work for me…so no sunscreen I guess!”\n\nI absolutely appreciate the elegant and super dewy finish as well as finally finding a part physical product that doesn’t make me look like a ghost (LOL)…I just cant see myself burning through 2 bottles a month (which is my current rate for 50ml sunscreens) and dropping $110 USD for them. IT MAKES NO SENSE LOL! I was lucky enough to find this sunscreen on Amazon for Buy 1 Get 1 Free…but it was a promotion that they forgot to remove from the site so I had to fight to get the deal. Outside of that (like I said earlier), I haven’t found them for much less than full price.\n\nRecently…I’ve taken to calling products that have exceptionally potentially irritating ingredients lists and/or unreasonably high prices (in my opinion) “irresponsible” for me to recommend. This sunscreen from Troiareuke falls into that category…I just cant LOL!\n\nMaybe, just maybe…this could be a “special occasion” sunscreen that you wear when that intense glow is super important. With the high amount of silicones in the formula…I could also see this product being excellent to wear under makeup as a primer/for that high sheen “show off that glow at the wedding” look. \n\nBut, for those that want the same protection, lack of white-cast, and a really nice dewy finish (although more watery and less shiny)…the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence is your new BFF. I love that product for all the same reasons as the Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. However, the fragrance is so much more bearable and it comes in at less than half the cost. If purchasing at Wishtrend…you can get 160ml of the Klairs sunscreen and still have $9.00 USD in your pocket for the price of one ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. I mean…come on.\n\nIf you have the extra cash and want to go “all out” with a sunscreen purchase…this is a worthy choice. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an affordable and well performing sunscreen. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Homosalate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Caprylyl Methicone, Titanium Dioxide, Isononyl Isononanoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Lauryl Methacrylate/Glycol Dimethacrylate Crosspolymer, Cyclopentasiloxane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Fragrance, Allantoin, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Sorbitan Oleate, Xanthan Gum, BHT, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexylglycerin, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Extensin, Niacinamide, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glycerin, Cyanocobalamin, Biotin, Ascorbyl Glucoside, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $55.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-uv-protector-essence](https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-uv-protector-essence)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kir0vv5f30x41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0661e8956db35e86a155f8d487f1d6f8e3b752a9",

    "body": "You may have heard of the Swiss brand, **La Prairie**. It is well-known for two reasons: history and price It's a really big name brand with a history, and **a price** point several times higher than many premium brands. In February, they released a new product **priced at $1,980**!!! Which is very expensive for 24 ml.  \n⠀  \n**So, what's inside**? I reached out to La Prairie for the full list of ingredients in this cocktail. They kindly answered and sent the full list (I'll put it at the end)\n\nThis is a quite impressive cocktail. I was initially skeptical about it, as I am about most highly-priced products. It is clear from the ads how much money and effort is invested in the product.  \n⠀  \nAs promised by the manufacturer, the product contains *a special mixture* of a couple of glycoproteins derived from yeast and *Lactobacillus*, *ginseng*, and *horsetail extracts*. It can be found in many La Prairie products. The distinctive component is *colloidal platinum*, and what’s even more interesting is the *mixture of growth factors* of plant origin. Plus, there’s a mixture of moisturizing ingredients (*amino acids, minerals, saccharides*). This is what a good anti-aging serum should look like.\n\nEven though the composition may look amazing, don’t let appearances be deceptive. The base of the composition is growth factors (plant) and good old Matrixil, and there are other cocktails containing this type of base which are as efficient, and much cheaper.\n\nLooking at the packaging of the product, it looks as if it’s worth even more than the 24ml product itself! \n\nI wouldn’t mind having this cocktail in my routine, but not at this price. Would you buy this product?\n\n\\---- The ingredients list ----\n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric/Succinic Triglyceride, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, **Glycoproteins\\*, Panax Ginseng Root Extract\\*, Equisetum Arvense Extract\\*, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract\\*, Lactobacillus Ferment\\*, Colloidal Platinum, Sodium Hyaluronate**, Argania Spinosa Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Rosa Rugosa Leaf Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Extract, **Oligopeptide-6, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Nicotiana Benthamiana Octapeptide-30 SH-Oligopeptide-2, Nicotiana Benthamiana Hexapeptide-40 SH-Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-10, Decapeptide-4**, Arginine, Threonine, Lysine HCL, Histidine, Serine, Glycine, Tryptophan, Soluble Collagen, Chitosan, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Sodium Mannose Phosphate, Mannose, Folic Acid, Calcium Pantothenate, Propanediol, Cellulose, Isomalt, Phospholipids, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Glucose, Xanthan Gum, Tin Oxide, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethylhexylglycerin, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Phosphate, Polysorbate 80, Sodium Oleate, Cysteine, Benzotriazolyl Dodecyl P-Cresol, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Potassium Sorbate, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Ext.

Products like these might have 2mg of peptide per mil. \n\nYou are much better off buying 100IU of HGH for $200, use 3iu a day and see real results. Plump and full skin, fat loss, thicker hair, softer skin, improved sleep,and a general feeling of wellbeing. Thats $200 a month for a product that is backed by countless studies and is still 1/10 of what you would pay at an antiaging clinic. Its very easy to find. If you can't afford that then spend $50 a month on injectable ipamorelin and sermorelin which is basically poor man's HGH. Anti aging clinics carry both of these but you will pay $250 min per month.",

I read every how-to guide, tried a ton of different conditioners, and just eventually decided maybe it wasn't for me.\n\nFast forward to last weekend- I went out of town and just threw a couple of random shampoo and conditioner samples I had on hand into my bag. One of them was a [Sachajuan Hair Cleansing Cream](https://shop.sachajuan.com/products/hair-cleansing-cream)\n\nI got to the hotel, realized it wasn't a shampoo and decided to give it a shot according to the package directions. I had low expectations, but it was AMAZING. My hair looked great air dried with no product, and the wash lasted with just a little dry shampoo for a solid week.\n\nI looked into buying a bottle and it is really outside my budget. I am willing to pay for good quality hair products, and I can technically afford it, but we're trying to save up right now, so I'm hoping there is something close, even if not an exact dupe, available for less $$.\n\nThe ingredients are: AQUA (WATER),GLYCERIN, ISOPROPYL PALMITATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, STEARAMIDOPROPYL DIMETHYLAMINE,GLYCERYL STEARATE, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), HYDROLYZED RHODOPHYCEA (RED ALGAE) EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, DICAPRYLYL ETHER, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, LINALOOL, LIMONENE.\n\nI've searched the sub and read a lot about what different ingredients do, but I'm not sure what's most important here?\n\nSo my question: am I just looking for something with glycerin high up on the ingredients list? Is there some combination of these ingredients that's most important? Or should I just suck it up and buy the real thing?\n\nIf it matters, I have thick, wavy hair that tends to be oily. Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated!",

YMMV BUT here are my results\n10 days in a row, if you skip two days (you'll see it) you'll have to start over...smh. There's no Vitamin C if you want something extreme..everything is \"natural\" and heck this really smells like oatmeal and feels...quite wet and soothing.

So would I buy this? NO haha my mom buys this for me and I am 100% appreciative. I think it's most effective for anyone who's skin is mildy oil with a few pimples at times. IF YOU have a bit of extreme acne (borderline cystic or pretty much cystic ;A;) it doesn't break me out. \n2/5 I use this when I run out of my vitamin c stuff (dr wu or dewytree) \n\nThank you for reading ;A; ",

I'm always on the look out for fragrance-free milk and cream cleansers, and I don't like to spend a lot on them really, I'd rather drop the ££ elsewhere in my routine. This one contains meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil and shea butter, which is nice because I always like a few oils in a second/AM cleanser to replace what's lost when you wash your face. It also contains a couple polymers, which apparently stop surfactants from penetrating too deeply and over cleansing your skin. The high oil content here might even mean that this cleanser can break down makeup and water resistant sunscreens, but I haven't tried it to find out yet!\n\nThe surfactants used don't look particularly interesting and seem few and far between, so perhaps this is a better option for those who use a washcloth or who like cleansers that leave a light emollient film, but I thought I'd share this on here since I've never really seen a cleanser this budget (£2 for 200ml!) with such a good INCI. Presumably it's pretty accessible too since it's Sainsbury's own brand, if it's sold in most stores then it'd be pretty easy just to pick up with your shop. It looks like a great budget option for anyone with dry or sensitive skin - isopropyl myristate can be an acne trigger for some so be mindful of that, but it’s in a good few of my favourite cleansers and despite being super acne prone it never breaks me out.\n\nThey also do a [foaming facial wash](https://incidecoder.com/products/source-of-nature-facial-wash) that looks pretty great too - I don't usually bother with foaming cleansers but the ingredients here look pretty promising and it's £2 for 150ml. Come to think of it, it actually looks more interesting than the milk - lots of glycerin, two really great gentle surfactants, soybean oil, but sadly no polymers unlike the milk. They do a toner and a couple night creams (toner doesn't look up to much but the creams look nice), and an eye makeup remover that might be worth looking into too. So pleased to see a budget skincare line formulated with care, and it's so cool that they made them fragrance-free so anybody can try them!\n\n**Source of Nature Cleansing Milk White Tea & Shea Butter:**\n\n*Aqua, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Squalane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycine Soja Oil, Disodium EDTA, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Polysorbate 60, Tocopherol, Citric Acid*\n\n**Source of Nature Facial Wash:**\n\n*Aqua, Glycerin, Coco-Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Glycine Soja Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Tocopherol, Chloroacetic Acid*\n\nYou can find the rest of the product's on [Sainsbury's website](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SearchDisplayView?catalogId=10241&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=44&amp;krypto=%2FDRH%2BBsB4VVnkVm97G%2F8Mu8Bsx8j7NduAzxTe1ccgua5bGLF7lGU%2BINmM35%2B2Ncnumxpqa4cpZzK5G09peKvec46DINkM8jgRfYq%2FEK425jsHdBj5D%2FUSC1VzkdVHP3hM1%2BNZeRNnNz1owO8jHWT9E4cAhUumZ09bC0tuezO4nygeWTndXU%2FwOhCaWRr7qtwdGBbzetv5jrKnyz0vTzNkg%3D%3D), the full INCIs are there.",

If you're interested in Lululun's products, I recommend picking up their weekly mask packs as a sort of trial period, if you will. I wish I did this. I'm not looking to fear monger or anything like that, either. \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium PCA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Alpha-Glucan Oligosaccharide, Honey, Paeonia Albiflora Flower Extract, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Peel Extract, Yeast Extract, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben \n\n[Source](https://www.lululunusa.com/lululun-face-mask-pink-36-sheets.html)\n\nType of skin: Combination (meaning it can be dry one day and oily the next)\n\nSensitive skin: Yes.\n\nSkin concerns: Minor uneven skin, lack of hydration, redness in some places along with some acne here and there.\n\nThe pros I can get into about these masks is that the mask itself fits pretty well on my face. The material also makes the application process quick and painless. I typically left it on for 10 minutes, sometimes a bit more. Afterwards, my face would feel plump to the touch and actually pretty smooth. I enjoyed how satisfying the experience of wearing it felt and how there would be this \"cooling\" sensation (probably due to the A/C in my home) I'd get from wearing them. I was going in the direction of mainly wearing these masks to the point where I bought more than just the singular box I've been using. Hindsight is 20x20, I wish I waited it out a bit more because of the cons that I experienced. \n\nAt some point in my experience of using the mask, I began to encounter some sort of skin irritation/burning on my upper cheeks around my nose, just a quarter inch below my eyes. Basically around where my cheekbones are located. I was a bit disheartened to find that yes, I was experiencing the issue many have mentioned in and outside of the subreddit. If I were to put it on a 1-10 scale of how intense the burning felt, I'd say it is about a 4, sometimes 5. At times, the sensation would go down to 2.5. I used this particular mask a few more times to see if it was just me. Now looking back, this was not a good idea. \n\nI tried it one more time tonight and I couldn't keep the mask on for more than 2 minutes because of the burning. I genuinely thought it was the product combination I used (Senka and Hada Labo products), but it turns out that it is the mask. I re-washed and everything so all is good. But the conclusion I've come to throughout all this is that I'm probably not going to be using Lululun products going forward because of how it affects me. Again, I'm not looking to fear monger or say that you shouldn't use their products but, even in their most recent formulation, skin irritation is still fairly present in at least the mask variant I used. Definitely try to get the 7 pc masks to try them out first. I can genuinely see why they are one of the best selling masks in Japan. \n\nMy skin personally didn't respond well to the mask at the end of the day. Everyone's skin is different. I'm going to be sticking to Kose mainly, but might try Senka's and Hada Labo's masks at some point for the heck of it. I'm going to try and cross reference the ingredients of the Kose mask I do have with Lululun's and see if there's just an ingredient I really should avoid going forward.\n\nEdit 08/19/2021\nAfter some light cross referencing, I came to the conclusion that a specific called citric acid is likely to have caused the irritation and burning. I'm not sure if this means the mask itself is too acidic for me, but I'm choosing to stay away from products that have citric acid in it. Which would mean doing away with the regular, precious, and over 45 line of Lululun. It is a shame because I loved these masks when they didn't affect me the way they do, but it's not worth skin irritation let alone burning to use them.",

I know what I'll be sticking to!\n\nThe moisturisers also seem very basic to me, I was hoping to basically see the regular serum with SPF in it for their light emulsion moisturiser, but appears not. Think I'll stick with my Simple Light SPF15 for £2.00/125ml instead of £5.00/50ml with this.\n\nDisappointing for me, was hoping this would have been a great expansion to the line, not a downgrade in ingredients for higher prices!",

    "body": "This review is for the orange bottle! Just received my purchase a couple weeks ago and so far so good! I'm Filipino with medium brown skin, acne-prone combination skin, and Fitzpatrick Type IV. I'm also undergoing laser treatment for acne/hyperpigmentation, so sunscreen is a MUST. Biore Watery Essence is my HG sunscreen, but I was looking for something that was water/sweat-proof for the beach and working out. Found this on Ratzilla's new release list for 2018 and subsequently purchased it on ebay. SUNCUT's sunscreen is oil, sweat, and water resistant. Unfortunately, that was before I saw the threads about the dangers of non-reef-safe sunscreens, so I'm still on the look out for a suncreen for beach days that doesn't turn me into a ghost, AND doesn't contain Oxybenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, PABA (Aminobenzoic Acid), enzacamene, octisalate, homosalate, or avobenzone. Let me know if you've found one!\n\nAs far as this sunscreen goes, no white cast! I like that it's kind of like an unscented version of Biore Watery Essence. The texture is very similar, though it leaves my face with a very slight tacky feeling. After it's sunken in a little, it's not noticeable to me at all. Presumably, this is from the alcohol content, which doesn't bother me personally. But beware if you are sensitive to it. I've only used this on days that I expect to sweat, so I'm unsure how it would perform under makeup, but Ratzilla says that it's supposed to act as a makeup base. They also state that it features a new Suncut serum \"Allerguard\" that supposedly prevents environmental particles, like pollen and dust, from clinging to your skin. But who knows how true that can be. It's reasonably priced, at least for my budget; I purchased the 110g bottle for $21.99. Overall I'd rate it 9/10. But obviously, YMMV.\n\n* SPF: 50+\n* PA++++\n* UV Filters: Octinoxate, Parsol SLX, Uvinul A Plus, & Tinosorb S.\n* Ingredients: Water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, alcohol, isododecane, polysilicone-15, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, silica, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, clematis vitalba leaf extract, spiraea ulmaria flower extract, equisetum arvense extract, hypericum perforatum flower/leaf/stem extract, hedera helix (ivy) extract, calendula officinalis flower extract, sodium hyaluronate, tilia cordata flower extract, centaurea cyanus flower extract, anthemis nobilis flower extract, phaeophyta extract, soluble collagen, butylene glycol, BHT, dipropylene glycol, PEG-10 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, xanthan gum, glycerin, propylene glycol dicaprate, silica dimethyl silylate, behenyl alcohol, polyethylene, polyhydroxystearic acid, potassium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben\n\nSources:\n1.

    "body": "**Brand:** Ace High\n\n**Product name:** Blue Suede Clay\n\n**Made in:** Rochester, Michigan, USA (Metro Detroit)\n\n**Container size(s):** 4 oz glass jar\n\n**Price:** $18.00\n\n**Unit price:** $4.50/oz\n\n**Product type, hold, finish:** Clay, medium-firm hold, natural finish\n\n**Top 5 ingredients/other formulation notes:** Water, beeswax, castor oil, bentonite, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil\n\n**Appearance:** Opaque, thick, has a light slightly-greenish gray hue typical of products high in bentonite, contains tiny darker flecks throughout.\n\n**Fragrance:** Apple jack, eucalyptus, and orange peel. On the first whiff you really smell the eucalyptus, and if you put your nose closer, it starts to smell of a sweet whiskey. Once in the hair, this whiskey-like smell is predominant, and throughout the day dies down to a sweetish woody scent that is very subtle. An unscented version is also available.\n\n**Scoop:** Getting this product out of the jar is a non-issue. Will come out with just fingertip pressure. Easy to take too much if you aren't careful.\n\n**Emulsification:** This is where things get rough. The breakdown starts out okay, but it almost immediately gets very sticky. If you took too big of a scoop, forget about it -- it felt like my hands were being glued together when I made this mistake! Pea-sized amounts are the key.\n\n**Application:** As with most other clays I use, Blue Suede goes into damp, towel-dried hair one small scoop at a time. Despite the stickiness in the hands, it goes into damp hair quite easily. However, if you took too long and your hair started to dry, you will lose a couple hairs. (This happens to me a lot -- the edges always dry faster than the middle.) All things considered it isn't as brutal as the Anarchist clay I reviewed earlier this week. WARNING: This product is not as forgiving as others I've used regarding amounts. I'd recommend starting with just a single scoop and build from there if you need more hold. Just a bit too much, and you will end up with hair that's near-impossible to style, clumps together, and feels disgustingly waxy.\n\n**Styles:**\n\n* Pompadour - 2 scoops followed by blow drying give me good lift in front while also keeping the back down. Using too much will produce a psycho quiff type look instead because the hair will want to stand straight up. Product feels very light in the hair. [https://imgur.com/a/7uoQIEE](https://imgur.com/a/7uoQIEE)\n* Textured side part - A scoop and a half does the trick. Finger combs nicely into place while using the blow dryer. [https://imgur.com/a/jv72tK2](https://imgur.com/a/jv72tK2)\n* Slickback - Works OK, but not great. Hold from 2 scoops is strong enough to keep the unruly edges of the long portion of my hair from sticking up. [https://imgur.com/a/sga9Ayr](https://imgur.com/a/sga9Ayr)\n\n**Results:**\n\n* 1 hour - Can feel the product in the hair, a little waxy. Smells almost as strong as when I first put it in.\n* 8 hours - A little volume deflation but not looking too bad. Still receptive to combing/brushing. Scent has died down to a very mild, slightly sweet woody smell. [https://imgur.com/a/0qHL7kj](https://imgur.com/a/0qHL7kj)\n* 24 hours (next day) - Pieces of hair are sticking up and won't stay down with just brushing or finger combing. Smell has gone away completely. The overall shape I created yesterday is still there, but it's starting to fall apart and look disheveled. It's looking a bit greasy. Time to wash out. [https://imgur.com/a/scfznRt](https://imgur.com/a/scfznRt)\n\n**Pairs well with:** Hairspray for extra hold. \n\n**Washout:** Comes off the hands with water. You are going to need shampoo to get this completely out of your hair though. One wash with shampoo was enough for me. \n\n**Final rating and thoughts: 8/10.** An overall solid product and great effort by Ace High. The volume it gives is pretty good, and the hold is on the borderline between medium and firm. Adding more Blue Suede to get more hold is not a good idea, as too much will turn your hair into a waxy, stringy mess. It scoops out smoothly but gets really sticky in the hands. I would use this for a single day at a time due to the greasiness on the second day. I will admit that I did not care for the scent at all at first (some people have said it reminds them of cough medicine, which I can totally see), but after owning it for a few months I'm starting to not mind it as much. I would buy it again, but in the unscented version!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout me/background: 30s F of northern/eastern European background with type 1A fine, straight hair which I color with henna. I've suffered from TTM for the past 10 years so my hair is also rather thin... this has gotten better since I've started putting product in daily, as I can't run my fingers along the strands as easily as before. I prefer low shine to matte products, of which clays are a favorite. My pre-styling and washout routine for all products is a wash and condition with either Bearsville shampoo bar or Suave non-clarifying shampoo, and Herbal Essences conditioner. I apply most products before blowdrying, with a few exceptions. My styling tools consist of a cheap round brush, a rattail comb, and two sizes of Conair pick comb. All products reviewed are used by themselves (meaning no hairspray, mousse, etc.) unless specified.",

The simplest way to explain it is that the b3 works like doubled sided tape inside each hair strand and helps the strands reform as one strand. This treatment is only designed to last 6ish weeks, and is not a permanent long term fix.\nAlmost all products sold as a split end “repair” treatment will not actually repair the split ends. They’re most likely smoothing the hair shaft to give the appearance of less split ends, and it washes out when you wash your hair. The emollients concentration in these products is heavy, so they can be very challenging to people with oily hair, because you are essentially adding more oil to the hair.  These products will not help repair the split ends, they more likely mask the problem. \n\nThe only way to get rid of split ends once they are actually splitting is to get a haircut.",

In the study they used a sunscreen that they deemed SPF 50+ UVA-PF 40. They also listed the ingredients as follows:\n\nAppendix S1 Ingredients of Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+, UVA-PF 40 (INCI): Aqua, Alcohol Denat, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Octyldodecanol, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, Titanium Dioxide (nano), Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Myristyl Myristate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, Glycerin, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Tapioca Starch, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Xanthan Gum, PEG-40 Castor Oil, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Parfum\n\nThese are the exact same ingredients as are listed on the [Eucerin Sensitive Protect SPF50+](https://incidecoder.com/products/eucerin-sensitive-protect-extra-light-spf50), and in the same order. It may then be safe to assume this has a UVA-PF 40.\n\nI was excited to read this as other than the Eucerin medical device sunscreen, Eucerin doesn’t normally reveal the UVA-PF of their products.

        "body": "Is this even still available? As far as I was aware, Stemm was discontinued a couple of weeks ago, and the parent company Deciem was selling off their remaining stock at a discounted rate. They’re apparently going to somewhat reformulate the products and bring them back under another brand heading, but idk if they’ve done that yet.\n\nStill, if they have any left and you’re thinking about getting it, here’s my experience so far. I just got the density stimuli like a week ago, after buying it when it became discounted. I use it every night, and the instructions say to use it on a dry scalp, and not to wash it off - so don’t use it directly before or after a shower.\n\nIt’s fairly easy to massage into my head, but it’s definitely a very wet serum, and it takes time to dry, almost an hour if I’ve been liberal with it. The top of my head definitely looks like I’ve just taken a shower after I use it. Its consistency is only slightly thicker than water and it kind of trickles down your head if you don’t immediately massage it in. But at the same time, it’s sticky?! Even after it dries, even in the morning, it feels a bit sticky, which is frustrating if you’ve just washed your hair. But if I brush through the stickiness, it dissipates and my hair looks normal. That’s my biggest complaint about this product - the stickiness makes my hair feel unclean.\n\nIt also has a very natural earthy but medicinal type of smell that doesn’t bother me and that I quite like, but I completely understand if someone else would be bothered by it. The first night I used it, the smell lingered for a while, but on subsequent nights I noticed it less and less, probably because I got used to the scent.\n\nIn terms of effectiveness, this is a serum that’s supposed to increase density of growing, so it needs time to take effect. As I understand it, it probably won’t have much effect on already grown strands of hair. So I need to wait about 3 months before I actually compare before and after. But so far there has been a very strong placebo effect where the morning after, I feel like my scalp is less visible through my hair. Again, probably just a placebo effect, but I like feeling like something is actually working, so that’s why I’ve kept it up.\n\nIn terms of ingredients, I’m most interested in the fact that it has a highly soluble version of caffeine, which has been proven to stimulate hair growth. As for oils, it says in the ingredients list that it has castor oil (which explains the stickiness to me, castor oil is notoriously sticky) so maybe not the best product for you? But also, it’s very low down on the ingredients list, so maybe you can tolerate it??\n\ntbh I’m 50/50 on it so far. I might be more upset if I’d actually paid the original $30+ for it, but since it was about $13 when I bought it, I’m ok with what it’s been doing so far.\n\nHope this helps!",

I suspect that these are good if you have sensitive skin or don't need a ton of exfoliation - I've found straight AHAs or BHAs too strong on my skin before. \n\nThe menthol gives me pause, even though it's the last ingredient on the list - why would there be menthol in an exfoliator, when it irritates the skin? Maybe to give a fake \"it's working\" sensation?",

I told her to try the silk naturals super serum, some avene retinol, some spf, Cerave cream and a weekly Lactic Acid peel. As for the cleanser I am stumped! [This](http://www.yonkausa.com/product/cleansing-lotion) is the current cleanser she uses from Yon-Ka. It needs to be a detergent free cleanser because her face doesn't like soap products too much.\n\nHere are the ingredients in the Yon-Ka cleanser: Water/Aqua, Mineral Oil/Paraffinum Liquidum, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Algin, Phenoxyethanol, Peg-35 Castor Oil, Chlorphenesin, Peg-40 Castor Oil, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Lactic Acid, Borneol, Fragrance/Parfum, Blue 1/Ci 42090, Alpha-Isomethylionone, Coumarin.\n\nAlso has anyone used [Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Rapid-Wrinkle-Repair/dp/B005OLQJGE/ref=pd_sbs_bt_2). It has Retinol in it and I'm thinking that may be easier for her to use than the Retinaldehyde in Avene and Osmosis products.",

The chrophenesin  is an antifungal/antibacterial but is used internally as a muscle relaxant. Seems like something odd to add in there, but I'm not a formulations expert haha.  There's lactic acid in there, but I don't know if it's used for exfoliation---the cleanser pH would need to be no more than 4 for it to be effective. \n\n\nAnyhow, I think a moisturizing cleanser would be good. Maybe something like Clinique Extra Mild Liquid Facial Soap, one of the GoW creamy cleansers, or even just Cerave Hydrating.",

It's quite plain for a character mask but at least the brand's name was printed down below.\nYou can find some more information at the back where the upper half is mostly in korean language while the lower part is in English.\nThe expiration date can also be found at the bottom, though you have to really squint your eyes to get a better view on it.\nOh, and it's also difficult to tear the packaging.\n\nREVIEW:\nWhen I first tore the packaging, the scent immediately hit my nose. The mask obviously smells like fresh apple. So yummy up until the point that I wanted to eat it.\nThe sides of my face have a nice fit, except for the eye area which I found it to be quite big for my eyes.\nThe sheet mask doesn’t fall off from my face.\nThe essence leaves a sticky residue so I won't recommend this for morning usage as the essence does take a while for it to fully soak into the skin and thus this will affect the application of your makeup.\nAfter patting the remaining essence onto my skin, my face immediately feels more hydrated and more plumper and I kept on touching it non-stop.\nHowever, the effect only lasted for a day.\n\nOVERALL:\nHm, not bad for a face mask. I wouldn't repurchase it because there are about billions of masks to try and this mask is not that great, to be honest.\n\nRATING:\n5/10\n\nHave you guys tried any of the character mask from The Face Shop?",

It's a really interesting pre/probiotic spray based on vegan coconut yoghurt, and it makes my skin soft, clear and even, yes, slightly glowy. However. For some reason Superdrug decided to scent it heavily with what I'd describe as a 'Barbie perfume meets nappy bags' scent. A blogger online has described it as 'poundland cotton scented candles'. It's bad. It lingers on the skin. It attaches itself to everything.\n\nNow, one thing I'm aware of is that a lot of these cheapy Superdrug offerings are dupes of stuff that's more expensive elsewhere. And I'm hoping that that's maybe the case for this? Google searches so far have thrown up a few probiotic toners but nothing that looks similar, but I am very much not tapped into the Skincare World right now and who knows, maybe a dupe is out there.

    "body": "Troiareuke ACSEN Toc Toner\n\nA fairly quick review for the Troiareuke ACSEN Toc Toner (at least compared to what I usually write haha!\n\nThis lightweight yet not completely watery toner features castor oil, chia seed extract, and chameleon plant extract. Sulfur and glycolic acid also make it onto the list for a formulation that is geared towards calming and mildly “clarifying” oily/sensitive skin.\n\nThe pump action bottle allows for the perfect amount to be applied to hands for patting in. Alternatively...Troiareuke recommends using this product with a cotton pad.\n\nWhile I did find this toner to be surprisingly lightweight and easily absorbed (considering the oil content)...it never really left my skin feeling sufficiently hydrated or “chok chok”. Even when patting in the famous “seven skins” my skin always ended up feeling pretty much the same.\n\nThe glycolic acid and sulfur are fairly low on the list which makes sense for those with especially sensitive skin. But for me, this translated into not much happening after nearly three weeks of use.\n\nGiven the size (100ml) and how much I needed to apply to cotton pads or for all of those layers...I BURNED through this product. I have a bit left in my bottle but I doubt I will make it the full month with this one. Another slight bummer considering the price of $38.00 USD.\n\nThe lackluster results and smaller than what I would have hoped for size makes this something I don't think I’ll be coming back to. Had the AHA percentage been a bit higher I could justify this as a “PM only” acid product...but the ACSEN Toc Toner just didn't have what it takes.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Glycerin, Methylpropanediol, Dipropylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Salvia Hispanica Seed Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Propanediol, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Dimethyl Sulfone, Betula Alba Juice, 1,2-Hexanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $38.00 USD - 100ml): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-toc-toner](https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-toc-toner) \n\nPS: I will be introducing another toner into my routine in the coming days that is even smaller in size than this one from Troiareuke. Keep in mind that I will be cutting that product a bit more slack as it is marketed as a mist...and for mist standards its size is average. Personally, I don't use mists as they are always intended and go for them in my toner step. Just wanted to clear that up to avoid any confusion between my ding against the Troiareuke product...look out for that review in the coming weeks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27wvx4b4cjo51.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d71ae5bb49d461c3ab542d70116acf662c41ecdc",

Since turning 30, my skin is consistently becoming dull so I am in the market for something to help return the youthfulness to my skin. The rep who was helping me gave me a sample of the Murad Advanced Active Radiance Serum. I used it this morning and it seems to be a nice product.

I said, “Well nowhere in your instructions “How do I make a return” on your website does it say that I had to track the order back to you.” It slyly lists it under “How are refunds processed.” So Instead of asking for tracking, I followed their lousy instructions and just shipped it at the post office and put the Return number with the packing slip in the box, as indicated by your website. They REFUSE to give me a refund now and they won’t call their “3rd party warehouse” to check to see if my package is there!

    "body": "Hi! So I recently bought this Vit C mask by garnier (more details below) and thought that it's too much liquid to reasonably use in one go. I decided to take it out into an old minimalist dropper bottle to store and I'm now using it as another layer in my serums and if it suits my skin then I feel like I hit a gold mine lol. I'm not sure if it'll be equally efficient cuz according to the pack you have to use three of these a week to see results, but I'm happy to microdose instead because I'm on actives and I don't want to go overboard. \n\nDetails: \n\nProduct: Garnier Vitamin C Shot Fresh Mix Booster Mask (there's also a hyaluronic acid variant)\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Betaine, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Algin, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Hydroxyacetophenone, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Citric Acid, CI 19140 / Yellow 5, Parfum / Fragrance. \n\nDescription: The pack contains a section filled with liquid which is separated by a breakable seal with a sheet mask. You're supposed to break it, mix the liquid into the sheet mask and use it in one go. \n\n[The mask package](https://preview.redd.it/ij5cuostfer71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=bea1709c75d616c1d3dd02ce0194b00f431256a1)\n\nThat's all, I just wanted to share this here in case you guys had any insight on how it'll work out or if this helps anyone :)",

    "body": "i've been contemplating and over thinking this post for far too long now, i'm new to SCA and i have plenty of unrelated questions but i didn't want to spam the community, so for now i've decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, there are many companies for example, The Ordinary that are making great products that are inexpensive. \n\nYour lucky you don’t really have acne prone skin so here’s the routine I’d recommend to you for blackhead:\n\nAM:\nGentle cleanser - I’d recommend CeraVe ($10.98)  \n\n\nSerum/Acids: For blackheads Id recommend - The Ordinary Niacinimide 10% + zinc 1% as its gentle and is known to un-clog pores. Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

But I looked up some of the Pacifica and Philosophy products on cosdna.com and the ingredients on those seem fine too. \n\nPersonally, I like to alternate my products a lot but that's because I know they all work for me/ don't break me out.

This makes my skin really moisturized and glowy. \n- plain yogurt or milk makes my skin look brighter and less dull\n- honey + green tea leaves\n- Turmeric powder. Add this to any of the above masks for a nice glow to your skin. (Skip if you're very pale because it might be too yellow) \n\n**Products to Try in the future**\n\n- Stridex pads in red box. It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun.

In the past if i ever broke out it was always in my T-zone so these very targeted breakouts in the corned of my jaw/ near my ears are unusual. \n\nI have a Kyleena IUD which I had inserted a year and a half ago. Before that I had the Mirena IUD for 5  years.  I dont know if this would have anything to do with it .\n\nI had been vegan for years and started eating eggs a few months ago. I thought it might have been causing the acne but I have stopped eating them and am still continuing to have breakouts. \n\nI also toned my hair a couple months ago and thought that maybe that was causing the breakout but i dont have any spots on my forehead or anywhere else on my face. \n\nThe only new product I have introduced is a toner which i use occassionally. The ingredients are as follows: Sodium bicarbonate, ppg-26-buteth-26, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, phenoxyethanol, disodium edta. \n\nThis is all the information that i can think of that might be relevant.

    "body": "I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to make your own warming and/or tingling lube at home using essential oils? \n\nI used to really enjoy KY tingling lube, but it has gotten crazy expensive and is really difficult to find, so I'm looking to make my own version. This also has the added benefit of being able to leave out a lot of the chemicals found in traditional store-bought lube. My thought was to use something like X-Lube or coconut oil as the base.\n\n\n\nBefore the comments start to get too off topic, let's get a few things out of the way:\n\n* I understand not to apply essential oils without properly diluting them first.\n* I understand that if you use an oil based product (i.e. coconut oil or similar) to dilute the essential oil that the lube will not be compatible with latex condoms.\n* I understand that some essential oils have a max dermal limit. I plan to stay way below the IFRA (International Fragrance Association) max dermal limits for leave-on products (those are significantly lower than wash off, usually half the rate).\n\nI'm interested in hearing from people that have actually tried this and getting feedback and suggestions on things that worked well. Along with any math and/or ratios for specific recipes and/or oil combinations that provide pleasant sensations.\n\n\n\nI also plan to start with the absolute minimum and work up from there. \n\nEx) Let's say that the maximum number of drops is 20, but the recommended number is 10. I would honestly start with 1 drop and test a small amount. If that doesn't have much of a sensation, I would add another drop, remix, and test again until I found a suitable ratio.\n\n\n\nTo be clear, there are already several commercially available lubes that use essential oils in their products. Here are a few that I was able to find in a quick search, but I'm sure there are others:\n\n**Durex Massage & Play 2 in 1 Lubricant, 6.76 oz, Sensual with Ylang Ylang Ingredients:** Water, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Saccharin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sorbitol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, **Cananga Odorata (Ylang Ylang) Flower Oil**, Ethylhexylglycerin, Flavors.\n\n**KY Natural Feeling Lube & Massage Gel with Botanical Essence Ingredients:** Water, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Flavor, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Saccharin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sorbitol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, **Cananga Odorata Flower Oil**, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**Cake Cooling Lube Ingredients:** water (Aqua), propanediol, polysorbate 20, gluconolactone, hydroxyethylcellulose, sodium benzoate, **mentha piperita (peppermint) leaf extract**, citric acid.\n\n**Cake Stim For Him Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Polysorbate 80, Oleth-10, Sodium Hyaluronate, **Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) oil, Kwao Krua Dang (Butea Superba) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract**, Caffeine, Niacin, Menthol, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aminomethyl Propanol",

A lot of common preservatives for topical formulas can be irritating or otherwise not ideal for mucous membranes, and you can't just reduce the concentration the way a commercial operation might because it's expensive to stress-test the formula and make sure it's not growing microbes despite a weaker preservation system.  Commercial factories are also able to maintain close to sterile environments that are hard to replicate at home, which means the preservatives in a home formula have to work harder.  If you must use a water-based formula, use it up that day and discard any excess, even if you stored it in the fridge.\n\nIf you're not using it with condoms, anhydrous oil-based lube would be easier to store.  Be careful sourcing your essential oils and other additives, I would use cosmetic-grade ingredients from a reputable source (e.g. not Amazon).  You can also buy pure cosmetic-grade menthol crystals as an alternative to essential oils.",

    "body": "Tldr: The oral rinse I'm using contains a bunch of preservatives and antimicrobials - is it wiping out good bacteria with the bad.  Is this stuff food grade?  What are the concentrations? Most importantly, Will my sense of taste ever return?   \n\nLet me start off by saying I am not a chemist... Also I am typing this on my phone so I'm not including references but I'm trying to use trustworthy/scientific sources and am checking against multiple websites and articles.  Do your own research\n\nI started using Therabreath about a week ago because of my bad breath/tonsil stones and have been satisfied with the results EXCEPT from the complete loss of taste. I've read all the FAQs and reviews and I am trying to suffer through the \"week or two\" until my taste buds reset, however it is nearly unbearable not being able to taste.  Even water tastes like it has a slight vinegar taste... \nAnyways, this morning I thought I might take a look at the ingredients to figure out why this stuff affects your taste buds so much.  Again, I'm not a chemist. \n\n  I am currently using Mild Mint: \nWater (Aqua) - Good start, no problems here\nPEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil - Polyethylene Glycol. Meh but ok I can live with it, I'll just try not to drink too much\n Sodium Chlorite - antimicrobial / preservative.  The FDA warns that it can be harmful if swallowed.  Also FDA warns that an activator such as citric acid can covert Sodium Chlorite into Chlorine Dioxide (bleach).  Mild Mint doesnt have citric acid as an ingredient but Invigorating Icy Mint does. What's that about?\nTetrasodium EDTA - a food preservative. I'm undecided on this one.  I try to avoid heavily processed foods and chemical preservatives. \nSodium Benzoate - a food preservative that inhibits growth of bacteria and other microbes. It's generally deemed as safe in very low concentrations, but the concentration isn't listed\nSodium Bicarbonate - baking soda. No issue here. Baking soda is proven to reduce bad breath\nMentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil - favor.  It's the last thing I taste every morning Sodium Hydroxide - Used to nuetralize acids.  I don't have a problem with this, it's pretty widely used in food and oral hygiene products so I'm sure it's fine. \n\nThis is just information I found on the interwebs. I'm looking for someone to answer my questions, I'm not writing this to discredit the product in any way. The loss of taste makes me nervous and I want to make sure I'm not doing permanent damage to my mouth by killing off all the bacteria in my mouth twice a day.",

    "body": "**Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\nWell, I think it has finally happened…I’m officially out of my sunscreen rut LOL! I had such a good experience with the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence last month…and this product from Troiareuke is another really nice chemical (and a bit of physical) sunscreen.\n\nIf I thought the lightweight feel of the Soft Airy UV Essence was special…this sunscreen from Troiareuke goes a step further. This formula is one of the thinnest and most lightweight feeling sunscreens I have used! And, considering this is a denatured/drying alcohol free formula…it’s kind of incredible. I’ve only felt this type of watery consistency with some Japanese sunscreens that are usually heavy on the Alcohol Denat. \n\nInactive ingredients include various texturizes, stabilizers, and silicones followed by fragrance (yeah…we will get there). Aloe Leaf Juice, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Centella Asiatica can also be found in this formula. Active ingredients include some fairly common chemical sunscreen filters (at least for K-Beauty)…but Titanium Dioxide in a rather small 1.49% makes an appearance as well. To be honest, the extracts and ingredients following fragrance were kind of lost on me. I didn’t see any soothing or exceptionally hydrating result from this product. But, I was really here for the feel and protection…so no hard feelings there. \n\nOkay, going back to the scent LOL! This product has a rather strong and slightly lingering clean/floral/powdery scent…and I do not like it. Similar to my one complaint about the Troiareuke ACSEN Pore Control Mask…I have no idea why the brand chose to add fragrance to a line geared towards acne prone/sensitive skin. Because of the texture and result this sunscreen still falls into my “love it” category. But, it would have been so much more amazing to me had Troiareuke omitted the scent.\n\nApplication of this product is pretty straightforward…just slather it on LOL! But, the silicones really help this sunscreen to spread around and distribute super evenly. I was never left worried that I missed a spot as everything glides and smoothes around the nose and chin. The little bit of Titanium Dioxide does leave behind the slightest of white-cast…but it absorbs/disappears within seconds and was actually helpful to see where I might need a bit more product. I never thought I would refer to physical filters in a sunscreen as being “beneficial” (at least for my darker skin tone)…but here we are LOL!\n\nOnce absorbed, this product leaves a VERY dewy and slightly shiny look behind. I know a lot of people (including my oily/combination skin peeps) might not like this “nearly greasy” feel/look…but I really love the ultra-dewy result. It might not be something I appreciate as much in the hotter months. The high amount of silicones helped to create this effect without the literal “grease” feeling though. Plus, they are a decent occlusives and help to hold in the hydration from toners/essences/lotions. I’ve used this product multiple times a day for the past couple fo weeks with no breakouts or excessively clogged pores.\n\nIn fact…this sunscreen provided a slight “pore blurring” effect (thanks silicones) much like the ACSEN Pore Control Mask. In it’s ability to mask larger pores and create a more even looking texture…the ACSEN line from Troiareuke has really wowed me so far. \n\nProtection was just fine when using the Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. Even though I am used to using products with a PA Rating of “++++”…I didn’t see any increase in redness or darkening of my skin with this PA+++ product. I feel like the Titanium Dioxide in this product helped to “reflect” and dissipate a bit more rays causing me to feel slightly more cool/comfortable in the sun. This benefit was really minimal to be honest but it was something I did notice.\n\nSo, overall…a really good sunscreen. Aside, from the fragrance this product was a total win. But, it is most likely something I won’t be coming back to and would probably NEVER be a sunscreen I would recommend. GASP…such a change of heart. Here’s why…\n\nThe Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence…in all of it’s 50ml…is priced at $55.00 USD on Soko Glam as well as the majority of sellers I looked up. Rarely does this sunscreen go on sale and if so the discounts are minimal. To me, this is simply too expensive for a sunscreen of this size. \n\nIt honestly frustrates and saddens me to see a sunscreen product this good be priced at such a prohibitive price point. I am a firm believer that sunscreen is the number one most important step in an effective skincare routine…but something at this cost excludes so many potential buyers. I would hate for someone to take a look at this product and say “Nope! I guess a good sunscreen is just too much for me…and the less expensive ones don’t work for me…so no sunscreen I guess!”\n\nI absolutely appreciate the elegant and super dewy finish as well as finally finding a part physical product that doesn’t make me look like a ghost (LOL)…I just cant see myself burning through 2 bottles a month (which is my current rate for 50ml sunscreens) and dropping $110 USD for them. IT MAKES NO SENSE LOL! I was lucky enough to find this sunscreen on Amazon for Buy 1 Get 1 Free…but it was a promotion that they forgot to remove from the site so I had to fight to get the deal. Outside of that (like I said earlier), I haven’t found them for much less than full price.\n\nRecently…I’ve taken to calling products that have exceptionally potentially irritating ingredients lists and/or unreasonably high prices (in my opinion) “irresponsible” for me to recommend. This sunscreen from Troiareuke falls into that category…I just cant LOL!\n\nMaybe, just maybe…this could be a “special occasion” sunscreen that you wear when that intense glow is super important. With the high amount of silicones in the formula…I could also see this product being excellent to wear under makeup as a primer/for that high sheen “show off that glow at the wedding” look. \n\nBut, for those that want the same protection, lack of white-cast, and a really nice dewy finish (although more watery and less shiny)…the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence is your new BFF. I love that product for all the same reasons as the Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. However, the fragrance is so much more bearable and it comes in at less than half the cost. If purchasing at Wishtrend…you can get 160ml of the Klairs sunscreen and still have $9.00 USD in your pocket for the price of one ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. I mean…come on.\n\nIf you have the extra cash and want to go “all out” with a sunscreen purchase…this is a worthy choice. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an affordable and well performing sunscreen. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Homosalate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Caprylyl Methicone, Titanium Dioxide, Isononyl Isononanoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Lauryl Methacrylate/Glycol Dimethacrylate Crosspolymer, Cyclopentasiloxane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Fragrance, Allantoin, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Sorbitan Oleate, Xanthan Gum, BHT, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexylglycerin, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Extensin, Niacinamide, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glycerin, Cyanocobalamin, Biotin, Ascorbyl Glucoside, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $55.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-uv-protector-essence](https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-uv-protector-essence)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2haphf6o30x41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3911c8481f0a3f708b9483101194a5f8d1b325f9",

Before i just used a [cleanser](http://www.boots.com/en/Simple-Kind-To-Skin-Refreshing-Facial-Wash-Gel-50ml_955963/) in the shower in the morning or just washed oil off my face with water.    \n  \n    \n  I've introduced two new products the [Avene cleanance](https://www.sanareva.co.uk/avene-cleanance-water-micellar-400ml.html)  and moisturiser [LA ROCHE-POSAY EFFACLAR duo+](http://www.feelunique.com/p/La-Roche-Posay-Effaclar-Duo-Unifiant-40ml?option=69761&gclid=CjwKEAiA6YDBBRDwtpTQnYzx5lASJAC57ObMvvJsGXV7U_Sa5fHEQ0L7_l-VeHBYAPBchLpWzKYB-RoCCcrw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).     \n\n\n  So I'm thinking either the cleanser is causing a purge or breaking me out. The ingredients are: **AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC  GLYCERIDES. PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CETRIMONIUM BROMIDE. DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE.

I have used 3 in the past [simple](http://www.boots.com/en/Simple-Kind-To-Skin-Refreshing-Facial-Wash-Gel-50ml_955963/), [nivea men](http://www.boots.com/en/NIVEA-MEN-Sensitive-Face-Wash-100ml_922607/) (which seemed to work really well), and [simple kind to skin](http://www.wilko.com/facial-cleansing/simple-kind-to-skin-moisturising-facial-wash-150ml/invt/0170376?gclid=CjwKEAiAjIbBBRCitNvJ1o257WESJADpoUt02kmceNAU5pfroS3G0QXi2O570VkPVsAfO_aZ_KFhjRoCJ4Xw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) (which strangely felt like it broke me out more than the other 2). \n\n**bonus point:** I tried the simple kind to skin face wash today instead of avene cleanser and although the avene cleanser doesn't feel tight or necessarily uncomfortable i can feel a difference in cleanser and the simple feels well more comfortable.

Anways, I am almost 21 and I've been pulling my eyebrows for few years already and I've even started pulling out my eyelashes. My father doesn't have eyebrows and eyelashes anymore and I can always see him trying to pick at non-existent hairs which then heavily triggers my trichotillomania on top of me being already stressed and anxious. Unfortunately, he gets angry at me when I tell him to stop doing that so now I'm trying for who knows what time stop pulling all by myself but few months of no pulling is the maximum for me. I'm so tired of spending hours in the bathroom looking at mirror and getting insane urge to pull everything that \"doesn't seem right\" even though I'm fully aware that I should stop doing that and that weird satisfaction at the end is definitely not worth it. My eyebrows and eyelashes were naturally on the darker, thicker, coarser side and people even used to compliment them, but now all I'm getting is people asking why I'm not filling them up or shaming me like my mother, but even all that shame is not enough for me to completely stop (instead I just end up feeling even more miserable). Is it too late for me to regain back what I've lost because right now they are thin, patchy, light and almost looking non-existent? I'm starting to let them grow once again (hopefully I don't relapse this time) and I've even installed some kind of habit tracking app. I also have some kind of lotion for stopping hair from falling out and making it grow even more with these ingredients: \nAQUA, GLYCERIN, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIGONELLA FOENUM-GRAECUM SEED EXTRACT, ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS LEAF OIL, PANTHENOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, SODIUM LEVULINATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, LIMONENE, LINALOOL. Will those help me? Should I get another serum or castor oil? Are my hair roots actually destroyed? What else can I do? Since I don't know how to use makeup should I pay for those expensive permanent eyebrows instead? How fast do the hairs grow anyway? Sorry for all these questions and bad English and thank you kind people of this subreddit, your experiences made me realize I'm not alone and that maybe there's some hope for me as well!",

It’s true that at some point your hair follicles will stop producing hair if you pick a lot but it depends on the person. My hair still grows back and I have a very severe case. I just try to apply castor oil to my lashes and brows every day at night, if I can twice a day. I’m going to be honest with you, there’s no magic cure that will\nHelp and I’ve been told by medical professionals that to some degree despite therapy and meds you will have to deal with it for the rest of your life. Don’t waste your money on expensive treatments, though the one I would receive if I had the money would be microblading (permanent brows). If you end up with literally no lashes as I have, I tend to stray away from serums in fear of them getting into my eye since there’s no hair there to protect it. Stick with castor oil for now. Lashes will grow back in 6 weeks but brows will take a little longer. It has taken me a long time to accept I’m stuck with this but fck others if they’re going to judge me off of that - that does NOT mean I’m not insecure or it doesn’t keep me from doing things because it does. It still affects me. You’re not alone. xo",

I will be trying tomorrow. I have also cut my nails literally super short in hopes it will help. IDK if it would but I'm willing to try \"temperature changes\", so about to go and wash my hands under really hot water just to see if it helps w mania. I have ADHD btw.",

    "body": "Troiareuke ACSEN Toc Toner\n\nA fairly quick review for the Troiareuke ACSEN Toc Toner (at least compared to what I usually write haha!\n\nThis lightweight yet not completely watery toner features castor oil, chia seed extract, and chameleon plant extract. Sulfur and glycolic acid also make it onto the list for a formulation that is geared towards calming and mildly “clarifying” oily/sensitive skin.\n\nThe pump action bottle allows for the perfect amount to be applied to hands for patting in. Alternatively...Troiareuke recommends using this product with a cotton pad.\n\nWhile I did find this toner to be surprisingly lightweight and easily absorbed (considering the oil content)...it never really left my skin feeling sufficiently hydrated or “chok chok”. Even when patting in the famous “seven skins” my skin always ended up feeling pretty much the same.\n\nThe glycolic acid and sulfur are fairly low on the list which makes sense for those with especially sensitive skin. But for me, this translated into not much happening after nearly three weeks of use.\n\nGiven the size (100ml) and how much I needed to apply to cotton pads or for all of those layers...I BURNED through this product. I have a bit left in my bottle but I doubt I will make it the full month with this one. Another slight bummer considering the price of $38.00 USD.\n\nThe lackluster results and smaller than what I would have hoped for size makes this something I don't think I’ll be coming back to. Had the AHA percentage been a bit higher I could justify this as a “PM only” acid product...but the ACSEN Toc Toner just didn't have what it takes.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Glycerin, Methylpropanediol, Dipropylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Salvia Hispanica Seed Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Propanediol, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Dimethyl Sulfone, Betula Alba Juice, 1,2-Hexanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $38.00 USD - 100ml): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-toc-toner](https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-toc-toner) \n\nPS: I will be introducing another toner into my routine in the coming days that is even smaller in size than this one from Troiareuke. Keep in mind that I will be cutting that product a bit more slack as it is marketed as a mist...and for mist standards its size is average. Personally, I don't use mists as they are always intended and go for them in my toner step. Just wanted to clear that up to avoid any confusion between my ding against the Troiareuke product...look out for that review in the coming weeks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/48xyi1ksbjo51.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5a9f6088715153d06b5ae491bc6595962ded1ca",

    "body": "I had my first snafu with an AB product last night when I used an Innisfree mask (rose flavored) with a high alcohol content.  Let's just say that everywhere the mask touched my face turned a nice tomato red and you could see a clear outline of the  mask on my forehead after the mask was gone.  Users in the IRC chat recommended that I put some aloe or some snails on it.  I had a free My Scheming Snail Essence Hydrating & Repairing black mask that came with a box of HA masks.  \n\nHere's a [link](http://www.amazon.com/My-Scheming-Essence-Hydrating-Repairing/dp/B00PKNYQMK) of the mask from Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients from the back of the pack**\n\nwater, glycerin, buytlene glycol, hydroxyethyl urea, cucumis sativus (cucumber fruit extract), chondrus crispus (carageenan), hydroxethyl ethylcellulouse, niacinamide, sodium hyaluronate, xantham gum, cestrum latifolium leaf extract, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, snail secretion filtrate, arginine, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, methylisothiazolinone, fragrance.  \n\nSnail is pretty far down on the ingredients list.  The mask does market itself as hydrating first.\n\n**The Essence**\n\nLike any My Scheming mask, this was full of essence.  I squeezed out the excess and it's the amount I use for lotion on my body.  It was literally running out of my hands.  I put some on neck, arms, legs, and the weird eczema patch on my leg.  I tried to take a picture of the package and had to wipe some essence off and more spilled out.  I put more essence on my legs (hey, I shaved today, they can use the moisture).  I tried to clean the package a second time and even more goop came out and I put more goop on the eczema.  I got a snapshot for my instagram, but I'm pretty sure my phone got snails in the process.  \n\n**Fit**\n\nThere was a little extra space on my forehead.  The ear portion oddly goes a little further back that most masks so my little sideburns are well snailed.  \n\n**The Verdict**\n\nThe mask worked as promised.  My skin is much hydrated and a bit calmer.  I feel like the black part is a bit gimmicky; it's a sheet mask.  \n\nBonus:  This mask is hella scary looking.  It scared my cat.  She stopped and stared at me nervously whilst passing by.  If you want to scare the shit out of your family, friends, and mail carrier--this mask is for you.  It's right up there with the rubbery Daiso mask in creepiness.   \n\nWould I buy it again?  If the price was right.  I haven't seen these guys out in the wild, but box of 8 black masks are selling for the same price as box of 10 normal ones on Amazon.  Maybe I'll try a few more if they call out to me, but I'm not buying a box anytime soon.  \n\n",

    "body": "So, to start things off: I have curly, low-porosity hair that's on the coarse side, and although I love my curls at times I've been really wanting to experiment with doing a silk press. Of course, I want to make sure I won't be damaging my hair in the process or ruining my curls, so I've been doing my research and looking around for my holy grail heat-protectant - one that can tolerate high-heat (around 425 F), has water-soluble silicones, no proteins, and no drying alcohols. I've already found a heat-protectant that I plan on trying soon (Discover Found Avocado Oil Heat Protectant Spray), however I'm still looking for a hydrating, heat-protectant leave-in conditioner to use prior to blow-drying. It's been a long search, and although I haven't found the perfect product I think I've come close enough with some of these. I'm open to some exceptions, such as using Amodimethicone because from my understanding it creates a thin film over the hair, doesn't build on top of itself, and mainly builds in damaged areas in the cuticle. Proteins are something I'd highly prefer to avoid as my hair seems to like getting as much moisture as it can get, but in really small quantities I may be fine. Also trying my best to avoid drying alcohols. So with all that in mind, I'd love to get some second-opinions on these products and which would be the best fit for what I'm looking for. I've left some notes on these, so I hope that won't confuse anyone lol. Any other product suggestions would be highly appreciated.
