I’m just a consumer who cares a little too much about sunscreen because I have a sun allergy. This has been sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks because I feel insecure about publishing this when I’m sure many of you will understand all this much better than I can. I’m also not affiliated with Allie or Kanebo or Kao or even the beauty industry at large in any way. Any corrections will be very welcome and appreciated.\n\nMany of the links aren’t in English, so I’ll indicate the language unless I think it’s obvious: ^(J) = Japanese, ^(E) = English, ^(TC) = Traditional Chinese, ^(SC) = Simplified Chinese (I’m sorry if I get Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese mixed up). Also, ^(PDF) = PDF.\n\n**[TL;DR](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyexf58/)** / **[Additional information](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu)**\n\n# About Allie sunscreens\n\n**Allie Extra UV Gel N** ([brand website](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.jp/allie/),^(J) [official product details](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/2027879),^(J) [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-n-2020/)^(E)) is an SPF 50+ PA++++ gel sunscreen for the face and body from the Japanese company [Kanebo Cosmetics](https://www.kanebo.com),^(E) which is part of the global [Kao Group](https://www.kao.com/global/en/).^(E) Kao as a cosmetics and chemical company is behind [many brands](https://www.kao.com/jp/products/) including Bioré, Curél, and Nivea Japan. Kanebo’s [brands](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/brand) include, well, Kanebo, as well as Allie, Kate, and Suisai.\n\nThe Allie brand also has a [Facial Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-facial-gel-n-2020/)^(E) that’s specifically meant for the face, a [milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-perfect-n-2020/)^(E) that’s also for the face and body, and a few tone-up/color-correcting gels, all of which are rated SPF 50+ PA++++. (And a few water resistant makeup products that I admittedly tend to forget about.) They’re currently marketing their color-correcting sunscreens, [Allie Color Tuning UV](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-color-tuning-uv/),^(E) quite heavily as a foundation alternative that also provides UV protection. Aside from the Color Tuning line, which was released on February 16, 2021, all of the current sunscreens were released on February 16, 2020 (2020 formula). The previous version of the Allie gel, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-spf50/)^(E) (without the “N”), was released on February 16, 2018 (2018 formula), and all the presently discontinued formulations released in 2018 and 2019 were also rated SPF 50+ PA++++.\n\nI’ve been using the Allie gel for nearly a decade now, starting with [the second formulation](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-mineral-moist-n/)^(E) released in 2012. [This 2013 article](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/japan-pa-system-for-uva-protection-revised/) from RatzillaCosme reminded me that I picked it up in the first place because it was one of the first sunscreens to be labelled PA++++. I do still try out other sunscreens from time to time, but I always have a tube of the Allie gel open concurrently with anything else I use. I’ve posted about the difference between the 2018 and 2020 formulas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/gkgwm8/sunscreen_kanebo_allie_februaryapril_2020_new/), and reviews of each version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/jmkjlk/japanese_sunscreens_pt_2_allie_extra_uv_gel_n/), with an update to the 2020 review coming up.\n\n# On testing and reformulations\n\nAfter learning about the loophole in Korean law through [Odile Monod’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) (via u/bloominglace’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/)) and [Instagram Highlights](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTA0MjgzMTIwODUyNTQ4?story_media_id=2553999541407826596_1588058418) (via u/FrenchbunnyG’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/gvbbsmz) in the same post), I tried to find information about the laws surrounding SPF/PA testing for reformulated products in Japan (because I live in Japan and therefore use Japanese sunscreens) but kept getting a bunch of hits about testing methods in general, and gave up trying to sift through it all.\n\nThe only product I personally really care about is the Allie gel, so I wrote to Kanebo directly and asked whether they test their reformulated products individually, with the 2018 and 2020 formulas of the Allie gel as an example, or whether their test results are carried over across formulations. Their response as of April 26, 2021 is that they test each version separately (“SPF/PA値の測定に関しまして、それぞれ測定しております”).\n\nI don’t know whether the same goes for all companies in Japan or not, or even for all Kao/Kanebo brands, but that’s one less thing for Allie users to worry about.\n\n*—And after leaving this sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks, I am adding that* u/ysy_heart *has posted* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) *about what the director of Japan Cosmetic Industry Association said about what their guidelines are on this subject.*\n\n# Hong Kong Consumer Council (October 2020)\n\nIn [the October 2020 report by the Hong Kong Consumer Council](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/jj0n81/sun_care_test_report_of_30_sunscreen_products/)^(E/TC) that everyone keeps referring to, the 2018 formula of the Allie gel (as seen in [the photo](https://imgur.com/seDmooL) published with the report) was rated SPF 61.7 PPD 9.8 (PA+++).\n\n*I’ll post a simplified version of [the results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(E/TC) in the comments, mostly for my own convenience. Pay attention to the countries where they were manufactured, because it won’t always be what you would expect based on the brand name alone (e.g., the Skin Aqua sunscreen they tested is not the version sold in Japan).*\n\nThis report has however been [strongly disputed](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/industry-backlash-against-hong-kong-055209520.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK4TL438S1-PdoMMNuPEgQDoqSsnxGnrdJkx3KD1AFFKhT954eT6y5wqfPHlPNFMeiTWZ-lR6QpiWq3MZrp6PHVo_bdAglpeqsFmR8XtBe5pnnk4BJt4fd153Auf6s1hr1H2AEnr-eQiw-Q7kFDoSSSO7LigiM7a2-yDLpXE0fxK)^(E) (bold added by me):\n\n>Pharmacology professors also warned that **variations in testing meant some results were not conclusive and flagged as an issue the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians**.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>**The Consumer Council outsourced the checks to laboratory company Eurofins in Australia which tested the PA factor in vitro rather than on human skin.**  \n>\n>The products were analysed under a European Union framework as the city currently does not have regulatory standards in place for measuring SPF and PA effectiveness.  \n>\n>The testing recorded the efficacy of Fancl’s Sunguard 50+ Protect UV sunscreen as SPF 14.3 and PA++, but reports from the United States and China, which both tested on human skin, reported an SPF of above 50 and PA++++.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>“Although the Consumer Council test was conducted in 2020, they’re using the methods from 2010,” \\[Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan, co-founder and executive director of Fantastic Natural Cosmetics Limited, the sole distributor of Fancl products in Asia excluding Japan\\] said at a press conference on Wednesday ahead of the watchdog’s publication of results.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>The International Organisation for Standardisation updated its methods relating to sunscreens in 2019 which recommended testing the SPF level on human skin.  \n>\n>\\[…\\]  \n>\n>Henry Tong Hoi-yee, honorary associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s department of pharmacology and pharmacy, said that **results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive as laboratories varied in their methodology and sample testing, often leading to large disparities**, citing three international scientific papers.  \n>\n>“Personally, I think a re-test \\[of the product\\] is needed in order to determine the reason for the large disparity,” Tong said.  \n>\n>He added that **the Eurofins laboratory results might not be entirely incorrect as it was a reputable institution, but its methods were not holistic enough**.  \n>\n>Professor Bernard Cheung Man-yung, from HKU’s department of medicine and president of the Hong Kong Pharmacology Society, said **the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience based on European standards**, rather than relying on a local sample, given **the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin**.  \n>\n>Cheung said consumers should not rely on sunscreen alone to protect themselves against harsh rays, advising the public to wear light long-sleeved clothing and to shield themselves with a hat or umbrella when exposed to sunlight for long periods of time.\n\n*Excerpted from Kathleen Magramo, “*[*Industry backlash against Hong Kong Consumer Council study which finds 83 per cent of sunscreen products do not meet protective claims*](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/industry-backlash-against-hong-kong-055209520.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK4TL438S1-PdoMMNuPEgQDoqSsnxGnrdJkx3KD1AFFKhT954eT6y5wqfPHlPNFMeiTWZ-lR6QpiWq3MZrp6PHVo_bdAglpeqsFmR8XtBe5pnnk4BJt4fd153Auf6s1hr1H2AEnr-eQiw-Q7kFDoSSSO7LigiM7a2-yDLpXE0fxK)*,”* South China Morning Post*, October 14, 2020.*\n\n**SPF testing:** According to both [the SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf)^(PDF) and [the ISO Protocol factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601367/spf-iso-protocol.pdf)^(PDF) that Eurofins links to from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/) on their Australian website, their SPF tests are performed according to the [ISO 24444:2010](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol, which they claim is accepted in Japan (p. 1 on the second PDF; Japan is listed twice, even). However, the current standard for SPF testing in Japan is [ISO 24444:2019](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-2:v1:en),^(E) effective as of February 21, 2020 according to [this notice](https://www.jcia.org/user/common/download/business/guideline/spf/SPF-jcia-r020221.pdf)^(J) (linked from [this page](https://www.jcia.org/user/business/guideline/spf)^(J)) issued by the [Japan Cosmetic Industry Association](https://www.jcia.org/en/)^(E) (JCIA)—or maybe it was also accepted before then? JCIA isn’t a government organization, by the way, so I don’t think they can actually enforce anything, but they seem to be in charge of setting industry-wide guidelines and work directly with the government in some capacity. Anyway, the same notice states that ISO 24444:2019 was issued in December 2019. The major changes between the 2010 and 2019 versions are listed in the Foreword of ISO 24444:2019:\n\n>— The definition of the minimal erythema response (MED) criteria has been revised.  \n>\n>— The choice of eligible test subjects is now based solely on individual typology angle (ITA°) with a requirement for the average ITA° for the test panel to be within the range 41° to 55°, with a minimum of three subjects within two of the three ITA° ranges.  \n>\n>— The ITA° is used to define the range of unprotected MED doses for the provisional or the test day unprotected MED determination (if no provisional MEDu determination is made).  \n>\n>— Three new reference standard sunscreens have been validated and added to the method to validate SPF test panels for products with SPF equal to 25 or higher (P5, P6 and P8).  \n>\n>— New test methods are provided to determine the uniformity of the beam of both large and small beam size solar simulators. A requirement for uniformity greater than or equal to 90 % has been added.  \n>\n>— Sunscreen application procedures have been described in greater detail.  \n>\n>— An informative Annex F has been added with photographic examples of erythema responses with guidelines for grading.  \n>\n>— The reporting tables in Annex G) and the requirements in Clause 11 have modified to provide more complete information on the results of the testing.  \n>\n>— The bibliography has been updated.\n\nThe notice from JCIA also lists most of these changes, with a few additional details. They point out for example that the Fitzpatrick skin type is being phased out as criteria for test subjects in favor of individual typology angle (ITA°), which will be relevant later in this post.\n\n*If you have no idea what an “individual typology angle” is (like me), it’s strictly based on skin color and seems much less open to interpretation than the Fitzpatrick skin type criteria. I found* [*this 2013 review article*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjd.12529)*^(PDF)* *in the* British Journal of Dermatology *really informative, though I admittedly have only skimmed through it very quickly.*\n\nIt’s possible that Eurofins just hasn’t updated their website, but I think this is what Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan (Fancl) is talking about in the quote above about the HKCC report using testing methods from 2010. [Fancl Sunguard 50+ Protect UV](https://www.fancl-hk.com/product_details.asp?item_id=5685),^(TC) their product in the report (rated SPF 50+ PA++++ and tested at SPF 14.3 PPD 6.8 or PA++), was apparently released in [2018](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10153767/top)^(J) in Japan, but according to the *South China Morning Post* article, “\\[Ma Chan\\] said that its product went through two rounds of testing by Cantor Research Laboratories in the United States in 2019 and the Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in China in 2017.” (Fancl also seems to point out that their product needs to be shaken before use in [this article](https://beauty.ulifestyle.com.hk/beauty/skincare/20099/fancl防曬-對消委會測試報告表示失望-強調產品完全符合標示-消委會就事件最新回應),^(TC) which could indeed potentially be something that affected the test results. I feel like it’s common knowledge among anyone that’s familiar with milk sunscreens at all, though, and I would hope that any lab conducting these tests would be aware of this. They also seem to say in the same article that any sunscreens that had extremely different test results should be re-tested in more than one lab, which is fair. But keep in mind that I’m reading a machine-translated version of the article for these observations.)\n\nI’m going to ignore the test run in China in 2017 because I believe it would have been following the so-called outdated testing methods, or ISO 24444:2010 (see the section titled “The Chinese version” below). [Cantor Research Laboratories](http://www.cantorlabs.com) basically just has their contact information on the website, so I can’t tell whether they would have conducted their test according to ISO 24444:2019, which would have been possible if the test took place in December. Cantor Research Laboratories was composed of 15 employees and specialized in anti-aging claims [as of 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09419-cover). *(They apparently do testing for Amway, a major MLM company, by the way; try googling* `\"Cantor Research Laboratories\" Amway study`*. —No, I don’t know whether that actally means anything, it’s just something I noticed.)* Eurofins Scientific on the other hand is composed of approximately 50,000 employees in 800 laboratories in 50 countries ([source](https://www.eurofins.com)), though I don’t have numbers for the Australian location specifically. I don’t know whether larger labs would necessarily produce more accurate results, but I would assume they generally wouldn’t be likely to be *less* accurate (or am I completely mistaken?). Interestingly, Dermatest, an Australian lab that was acquired by Eurofins ([source](https://dermatest.com.au)), lists Cantor Research Laboratories among their “Scientific Associates” on [their Links page](https://dermatest.com.au/information/links/). They also cite Cantor Research Laboratories’ Operating Procedure Manual on what appears to be another one of their factsheets, “No. 28 Antiperspirant Efficacy,” published on p. 12 of the February 2017 issue of *The Science of Beauty* (vol. 6 no. 7; [PDF](https://ascc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SOB-Feb2017.pdf)). On Eurofins’ Australian website, they instruct that samples should be sent to “Eurofins Dermatest,” located at the same address on the Dermatest website ([example](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/)), so I’m pretty sure we can think of them as the same entity. Clearly they know of Cantor Research Laboratories, and I wonder what they would say about the discrepancy.\n\nReturning to the *South China Morning Post* article, I assume that “the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians” is in reference to SPF testing, not PA testing, since the latter was *in vitro*. According to Eurofins’ [SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf),^(PDF) their test subjects “consisted of fair skin individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II or III” (p. 3). As mentioned above, ISO 24444:2019 no longer uses Fitzpatrick skin types as criteria for test subjects, so I think we can establish that the SPF results in the report cannot be compared directly with any SPF ratings based on ISO 24444:2019. There are however multiple sunscreens that were released before 2020 and would have been based on ISO 24444:2010.\n\nSo referring back to ISO 24444:2010, according to [this PDF from some time before 2013](https://www.tes-h.co.jp/documents/SPFPFA.pdf)^(J)—but I’m not sure whether it’s after 2010—Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III were part of the criteria for SPF test subjects (and types II, III, and IV for UVAPF). This would definitely be before 2010, but [this paper](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sccj1979/26/3/26_3_207/_article/-char/ja/)^(E/J) published by JCIA in 1992 also specifies Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III for SPF testing. As discussed below, the same goes for China as of 2015. So it seems like the Eurofins test subjects and test subjects in Japan and China (before ISO 24444:2019) would have the same Fitzpatrick Skin types, but Dr. Dray suggests in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGwjKOHq02w) (“Can we trust sunscreen? Korean SPF controversies,” April 30, 2021) that test subjects in different regions are likely to be skewed toward different skin tones. This is just speculation, but maybe it’s possible that more of the test subjects in Japan and China could have been types II and III, for instance, and more of the test subjects for the HKCC report could have been types I and II. (I’m guessing that this is what Professor Cheung means when he says that “the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience \\[…\\] given the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin.”) In that case, while we absolutely couldn’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report, perhaps the report’s SPF ratings could possibly be pertinent if you have type I skin. But again, this is entirely speculative.\n\n**PA testing:** The Australian Eurofins website seems to confirm that their UVA tests are performed *in vitro*. I’m assuming they follow the [ISO 24443:2012](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24443:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vitro*), since they have [a factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601373/iso-24443-in-vitro-uvapf.pdf)^(PDF) for that too, linked from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/uva-tests/) on UVAPF testing. (ISO 24443:2012 is also mentioned at the bottom of [the report’s results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(TC) in footnotes 4 and 5, but I gave up on trying to figure out what it actually says.) In Japan, however, UVAPF testing is performed according to the [ISO 24442:2011](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24442:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vivo*). Eurofins themselves state in this factsheet that both the Japanese and Korean markets require *in vivo* testing, which they also point out is much more expensive than *in vitro* testing (p. 1). They also state that UVAPF ratings determined by these tests are considered **estimates** of Boots Star, FDA Broad Spectrum,\\* and JCIA UVAPF (= what most of us know as PA) ratings (p. 2).\n\n*\\* The FDA website says in vitro testing is accepted in accordance with* [*21 CFR 201.327(j)*](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b97fda59bb83d2742a276a215cdc115e&mc=true&node=se21.4.201_1327&rgn=div8)*, which I didn’t have the energy to actually read and am assuming is the same thing as Eurofins’ factsheet on* [*FDA Broad Spectrum Testing*](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601376/fda-broad-spectrum.pdf).*^(PDF)* *They say it’s based on ISO 24443:2012 but with “differing film thickness and pre-irradiation requirements” (p. 1).*\n\nIf the UVAPF testing for the HKCC report was indeed in accordance with ISO 24443:2012, I wouldn’t discredit the results entirely—but again, I’m not an expert. While we can’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report (same as the SPF ratings), it seems to me that the PPD ratings they give in the report could potentially be used to make comparisons with sunscreens from other countries where UVAPF ratings are also determined in accordance with the *in vitro* ISO 24443:2012 protocol, or at least with other results within the same report (though we would still have to keep in mind that “results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive”). Eurofins’ own factsheet suggests that ISO 24443:2012 is accepted in Australia, New Zealand, and the EU, but I haven’t done any research to back this up, and we have already seen that their factsheets might be outdated.\n\nThe next versions of [ISO 24442](https://www.iso.org/standard/75496.html)^(E) and [ISO 24443](https://www.iso.org/standard/75059.html)^(E) are about 40% through their respective development processes, by the way, so that’s something to keep an eye on if you’re looking into this stuff.\n\n**EDIT:** u/lovethewayyoulick has posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gycvnq4/) about the formulation of Allie sunscreens, specifically regarding Kao/Kanebo’s proprietary “[ADVAN Technology](https://www.kao.com/jp/skincare/surface/surface-02/),\" the name ADVAN coming from “Anti-Damaging uV-A Network.” In a nutshell, their sunscreens are designed to work with sebum to provide higher UVA protection, which would not be reproducible with standard *in vitro* testing. It also seems to explain why Allie sunscreens don't always do too well in casual experiments using light-sensitive materials (as I discuss in the section I had to delete for length posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyc9sqv/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I’m now also thinking of other Japanese sunscreens that claim to work with different factors to increase their protection. Shiseido’s [Anessa](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/about/) sunscreens, for instance, advertise their “Thermo-Booster Technology” to work with heat and “Aqua-Booster Technology” to work with sweat and water. These product-specific factors may not necessarily be taken into account in third party testing.\n\n**Other possible issues:** Even after looking into all this (without actually reading all the publicly available details in each ISO… sorry, that’s beyond my mental capacity right now), I still don’t know whether the difference between the testing methods would really explain the larger disparities in the SPF results, like the Fancl sunscreen. I’ve seen some of you make a very good point that how old the bottle used for the test is (and I would assume things like storage conditions; last summer was a particularly hot one, and some supplements I ordered from the US arrived practically melted together in the bottle) or even the specific batch could potentially affect test results, too.\n\nFor more information about the actual testing methods, see [\\[Discussion\\]How SPF and PA are measured in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mqysux/discussionhow_spf_and_pa_are_measured_in_japan/) by u/ysy_heart. (I want to note that the SPF testing methods described here are based on ISO 24444:2010 and have technically been phased out, but it seems general enough to be at least mostly applicable for ISO 24444:2019, too.)\n\n*—Phew, that was long! I keep seeing this report being mentioned, so I wanted to try my best to do my due diligence. I don’t have a background in science, though, and it’s my first time even actually looking at ISOs, so I’m sorry if I’m completely off.*\n\n# National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan (May 2020)\n\nIn another [report by the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/)^(E) published in May 2020, either the 2018 formula or the 2020 formula of the Allie gel (unclear) was confirmed to be SPF 50+ PA++++ in two out of two tests using a spectrophotometer, though I’m honestly skeptical of the general accuracy of these tests, seeing how four sunscreens claiming to be SPF 30–35 tested consistently at SPF 50+. I guess Japanese companies *could* plausibly be motivated to label their products with lower ratings than what they actually are, since many consumers here believe that high-SPF products are rough on your skin and can actively seek lower-SPF products for daily use, but as an amateur, it seems like it would be easier to actually make a low-SPF product if that’s what you want to sell.\n\nAgain, these tests were performed with an *entirely* different method, and I imagine their results can only be used to draw comparisons with other results in this same report, if anything at all. (For more information on the testing method, see u/ysy_heart’s research and thoughts in the link for the report.)  If there’s so much hubbub about the testing methods in the HKCC report, I’m sure testing with a spectrophotometer would be even further off. I want to give the NCACJ credit for at least running each test twice instead of just doing it once and being done with it, but I also don’t know whether running the spectrophotometer tests even a hundred times would necessarily be credible.\n\nAlso, although the HKCC report seems to have product name errors too (I’ll cut them some slack because they’re dealing with products from other countries, and the photo helps with product identification), I can definitively say that the report the NCACJ published has [some mistakes and ambiguities](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/gvsj5eh).^(E) This doesn’t necessarily mean that the tests themselves are equally faulty, but it does make me wary of any other potential mistakes in printing the test results.\n\n# The Chinese version\n\nThe Allie gel is also rated SPF 50+ PA++++ [in China](https://allie.cn)^(SC) (and SPF 45 PA++++ after being immersed in water according to [their official TMall page](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a212k0.12153887.0.0.1a67687dAgrr3k&id=596686898582),^(SC) if I’m interpreting “浴后防晒指数” correctly), where they require testing at National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) accredited labs in China, as well as additional *in vivo* testing ([source](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2019/08/19/Sunscreen-regulations-in-the-world-from-European-Union-USA-Canada-to-China)^(E)). The NMPA-approved testing methods seem to be detailed in [this 11 MB PDF](https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/directory/web/nmpa/images/MjAxNcTqtdoyNji6xbmruOa4vbz+LnBkZg==.pdf)^(SC) of their Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics (2015), SPF testing from p. 546 and PA or PFA testing from p. 554. I’ve given up on trying to decipher everything, but it appears that their SPF testing either follows or is based on ISO 24444:2010 (so it might have been updated by now), using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III, and their PA testing either follows or is based on ISO 24442:2011, using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV.\n\nInitially I was satisfied in thinking of this as another separate test performed on the Allie gel, but then it occurred to me that I don’t know whether the Chinese version has the same formulation as the Japanese version or not, though I assume they would at least be very similar. [Based on the packaging](https://imgur.com/a/WbH2gAS),^(E) I’m guessing that the current version there is basically equivalent to Allie Extra UV Gel (the 2018 formula in Japan). [This page](https://www.jeebei.com/pingce/hufupin/ql1z6.html) lists the ingredients as follows:\n\n> 水，乙醇，氧化锌，三乙氧基辛基硅烷，甲氧基肉桂酸乙基己酯，丁羟甲苯，甘油三（乙基己酸）酯，异壬酸异壬酯，丙烯酸钠/丙烯酰二甲基牛磺酸钠共聚物，异十六烷，聚山梨醇酯-80，丁二醇，甘油，双-乙基己氧苯酚甲氧苯基三嗪，乙基己基三嗪酮，聚二甲基硅氧烷，黄原胶，EDTA 二钠，水解胶原，苯氧乙醇，透明质酸钠\n\nThis translates to:\n\n> Water, Ethanol, Zinc Oxide, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BHT, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\nThis is the ingredient list for the Japanese 2018 formula, according to the packaging of a tube I bought in a major drugstore in Japan:\n\n> Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethanol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen\n\n*Both are my own translations and I don’t have a background in chemistry. Also, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate = Octinoxate, Ethylhexyl Triazone = Uvinul T 150, and Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine = Tinosorb S.*\n\nObviously, the order of the ingredients differ, but I don’t know whether China has the same rules about the order of the ingredients or not. One definitively different point, though, is that the Chinese version contains Phenoxyethanol and the Japanese version doesn’t. So while I can’t say how different or similar the two versions might be, it’s clear that they aren’t exactly the same.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that the [Bioré UV Athlizm essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-athlizm-skin-protect-essence/)^(E) and the [Bioré UV Aqua Rich gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-gel-2019/)^(E) and [essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-2019/)^(E) are all rated SPF 50+ PA+++ [in China](https://www.kao.com/cn/products/biore/),^(SC) and not SPF 50+ PA++++ as they are rated in Japan, but since they are sold ~~(and possibly manufactured)~~ locally by Kao (China) Holding Co., Ltd. rather than as import products from Japan, you would have to consider the possibility that they may not necessarily have the same formulation as the Japanese equivalents.\n\n**EDIT:** I’ve just figured out that the Chinese versions of the Allie gel and Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence are made in Japan with different formulations specifically for the Chinese market. See links re: each product [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu).\n\nSimilarly, RatzillaCosme says in a comment on [this page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-gel-spf50-4-plus/) that “Rohto products that are marketed for outside of Japan have different ingredients/formulas than Japan’s and they’re not Japan-made (despite the Japanese printed). If the Japanese version is what you want, both the packaging and product name need to be exactly the same as what \\[is\\] shown in my site.” They also say in a comment [here](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-essence-2020/) in response to an inquiry about [Sunplay Skin Aqua](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/index.shtml) Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ (I’m not sure but possibly [this](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-75.shtml)^(SC)), “That product isn’t Japanese — it’s made in China by a different company. It isn’t produced by Rohto Pharmaceutical in Japan.” (Credit goes to someone on this sub for mentioning that Ratzilla talks about this in their comments section. I’m sorry I can’t remember who it was.) Going back to the HKCC report, the results table says that [Sunplay Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-72.shtml)^(SC) is manufactured in China (in addition to the “Sunplay” in the product name already being a giveaway; in Japan, [Mentholatum Sunplay](https://jp.rohto.com/uv-sunplay/) is a separate Rohto brand alongside Skin Aqua, so “Sunplay Skin Aqua” doesn’t exist), so the results in the report would not necessarily be applicable for the Japanese product, not to mention the other concerns I discussed.\n\nSo the situation arises where there are products that aren’t “fake” but also aren’t exactly the same thing as what’s sold in Japan, kind of like how the American versions of LRP sunscreens wouldn't contain their more advanced filters (which is probably more drastic of a difference than what I’m discussing here). This might be especially important for anyone buying the product from non-Japanese vendors. Double check to make sure you’re getting the version you intended to buy—and if you specifically wanted the non-Japanese version, that’s great too. Like [the American and Japanese Curél Intensive Moisture Creams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/labr3m/difference_between_japanese_and_american_version/), it’s possible that the end result (the user experience) is pretty much the same anyway, but in the case of sunscreen, make sure you know what the SPF/PA rating is for the exact version you’re buying.\n\n# Using sunscreens from major corporations\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNsoPyo1PjA)^(J) posted on March 26, 2020, skinfluencer Arata Tomori says that SPF testing is usually outsourced to a third party lab, and that PA testing is often performed in-house (I haven’t looked into this). She says that different labs can come up with different results, and based on her own past experience with trying to make a sunscreen (I think she has her own skincare line), she has heard of labs that are actually known to give higher SPF ratings. She recommends that we stick with major corporations that are more likely to be working with labs that would provide accurate results.\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTS0Xd-T97s)^(J) posted on March 28, 2020, cosmetic chemist YouTuber Sumisho discusses issues with SPF ratings in general, with the AMA Laboratories case in the US as an example. He says we should be careful with smaller brands, and advises that it’s a good idea to pick products that are made by major corporations that put a lot into sunscreen R&D. He also advises that products sold in China go through additional testing and could be more reliable, and that you could check Tmall for listings, but I want to add again that you would need to make sure you’re looking at the version you want.\n\nOdile Monod also breaks down the difference between OBM, OEM, and ODM products in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) I mentioned earlier. Although she’s talking about the Korean beauty industry, I think this part probably applies for other countries, too, and she advises that it’s (not necessarily foolproof but) a good idea to pick OBM products that are formulated and manufactured in-house.\n\nAnd now [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) about the response u/ysy_heart got from the JCIA director can be interpreted to back up this approach as well. I’m generally in favor of indie brands in spirit, and usually I would think more about how these people might be benefiting from making these claims, but I do see how major corporations would have a lot more to lose from these sunscreen scandals. I also don’t think I’ve seen companies like Amorepacific (for instance) mentioned in connection with the recent scandal in Korea.\n\nI’m still looking up different sunscreens and who actually manufactures them, but the Kao Group (including Kanebo), the Kosé Group, the Pola Orbis Group, the Rohto Group, and the Shiseido Group are some major Japanese corporations that seem to generally have OBM products. I have a huge spreadsheet in progress that I plan on sharing whenever I think it’s ready, with specific products from these companies (and others) and some properties I wanted to compare.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nIf you’re *really* concerned about the accuracy of SPF/PA ratings, I guess the truly thorough approach would be to look at as many tests as possible. You could either stick with the sunscreens that consistently do well in third party testing (guilty until proven innocent) or avoid those that consistently do poorly (innocent until proven guilty).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it just isn’t realistic, especially considering how frequently Japanese sunscreens are reformulated. A test result from last year might not be applicable for a product that was reformulated this year. You would have to make sure where the product tested was manufactured and what year it was released, and then there are the potential issues with storage conditions and different batches, etc. Also, “real” testing is expensive, and it’s not all that likely that there would be multiple credible third party tests following official protocols performed on the same formulation.\n\nAs Professor Tong says in the *South China Morning Post* article, we should probably accept that no single test is going to be an absolutely definitive one. Personally, with regard to what I’m already using, if it’s keeping my sun allergy symptoms from showing up, that’s good enough for me—but I guess you could say that I have the advantage (?) of my face being a hypersensitive UV meter of sorts. As for any products I might try in the future, I’m going to keep trusting the ratings as they are claimed unless there’s a scandal specifically involving that product. We *are* already taking a kind of leap of faith in trusting that the product is otherwise safe to use and that the ingredient list is correct and so on. And regardless of any tests results, even good ones, I would make sure to apply plenty, to reapply, and to avoid relying on sunscreen alone, especially if I’m going to be outside for an extended amount of time.",

I’ve been living in Japan for over 10 years, and am under the impression that the general consensus among Japanese consumers is that you use either Anessa or Allie if you don’t want to tan/burn, Anessa being top-level protection and Allie coming in second while also being easier on your skin. (This seems to specifically be based on Anessa’s [flagship milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/anessa-perfect-uv-sunscreen-skincare-milk-a-2020/)^(E) and Allie’s gel products, even though Anessa also has gels and Allie also has a milk.)\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean they’re absolutely the best sunscreens in the entire Japanese market, of course—the products discussed on this sub represent just a small fraction of all the sunscreens available in Japan—nor do I know how they would really compare with European sunscreens (which I’ve never used, aside from a couple of Asia/Australia-specific LRP products), but it does suggest that they must at least be among the best that are commonly available in drugstores nationwide.\n\nAllie sunscreens seem to do well in those completely unscientific experiment memes where people apply a ton of different sunscreens on their backs and lay out in the sun:\n\n|**Video/Article**|**Sunscreens and UV source**|**Conclusion**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sunameri for Kakaku.com, [人気の日焼け止め10種を徹底比較！ 日サロで肌を焼いて効果を確かめてみた](https://kakakumag.com/houseware/?id=11834), January 14, 2019|10 sunscreens including Allie Extra UV Gel (2018 formula);

I always got a little worried about these reports coming out about my beloved Allie sunscreen, but I feel confident about it now. I went to the sunny beaches Australia, Okinawa, Thailand, and Hawaii with my Allie sunscreen and I've never gotten a bad tan! Granted, I was wearing sunglasses, a hat, and occasionally a sun umbrella but I think that proves your final thoughts - apply plenty and reapply, reapply, reapply!",

I'll be keeping my review of each item fairly short. I also want to mention that some of these products are either discontinued or have been reformulated, which I will note. If I can find the ingredient list for these products I will also be linking them as well.\n\nTo give some context about me and my skin type, I'm mid to late 20 year old male, my skin type is combination (oily T-Zone, dry to normal U-Zone) and I suffer from cystic acne ever since I was a teenager. I live in a climate where it's fairly dry all year round with harsh winters; gets down to around -20C which is -4F, and in the summer it sometimes can get fairly hot around 30C which is 86F.\n\nMy main concerns for my skin is acne and the hyperpigmentation it leaves behind.\n\n**Cleansers:**\n\n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-pyunkang-yul-acne-facial-cleanser) \\- this was just an ok cleanser, nothing to rave about but nothing to boo at. I don't think it'll necessary clear much acne, even if you have common acne. It does create a slight lather. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance free. \n* [*Etude House Real Art Moisture Cleansing Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-real-art-cleansing-oil) \\- was not really a fan of this cleansing oil, I don't really wear makeup so I can't really say how well it cleansed, but the fact that it has fragrance kinda peeves me off. Alcohol free, has been renewed once. \n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing 5.5 Cleansing Foam*](https://incidecoder.com/products/papa-recipe-eggplant-clearing-5-5-cleansing-foam) \\- this is a basic foam cleanser, I don't really think it really helps with acne. Lathers pretty well, and with these foam cleansers, you only need a small amount to cleanse your face so it lasts a long time. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*2ndesign First Cleansing Oil Pure & Fresh*](https://incidecoder.com/products/2ndesign-first-cleansing-oil-pure-fresh) \\- didn't mind this oil cleanser, minimal ingredients, has a tolerable scent for a wash off product and it's quite affordable. Emulsifies well, and doesn't leave a weird film on the skin. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*Cosrx Low pH good Morning Gel Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-low-ph-good-morning-gel-cleanser) \\- i probably have emptied more than one tube of this, but obviously, who can say they've delved into AB without trying a Cosrx product before. I think this is fine because I have somewhat oily skin, but from what I've read general consensus is that it's not great for dry skin. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-hydrating-cleanser-2) \\- for me this cleanser is probably one of the best cleansers on the market. The fact that it's a milky, non-foaming cleanser is somewhat comforting, especially during the colder winter months. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-hydrating-micellar-water) \\- this shit will sting your eyes if you're not careful, it's probably because of the high niacinamide content. Other than that, I think it's fine. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Bioderma Sensibio H2O*](https://incidecoder.com/products/bioderma-sensibio-h2o) \\- i mean, this is fine. I don't think it's really worth how much it cost compared to all the options we have now, but this was the first micellar water if I'm not wrong so, pop off I guess. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Garnier Skinactive Micellar Water All-In-1*](https://incidecoder.com/products/garnier-skinactive-micellar-cleansing-water-all-in-1) \\- i've probably emptied at least five bottles of this by now. If you're looking for a micellar water that's fuss-free, I recommend this one. It's cheap and easy, what's not to like. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Clinique City Block Purifying Charcoal Cleansing Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/clinique-city-block-purifying-charcoal-cleansing-gel) \\- i don't like this. Regardless this has been discontinued it seems. \n* [*su:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick*](https://incidecoder.com/products/su-m37-miracle-rose-cleansing-stick) \\- remember when cleansing sticks were so hyped up? yeah I didn't even finish this. Anyways it's been discontinued but this is not great. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Toners**:\n\n* [*Pyunkang Yul Mist Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner) \\- simple basic mist, it only has five ingredients. I didn't really expect much from it and it didn't really do much for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-toner-essence) \\- there's not much viscosity to this toner, it's pretty much water-like. If you're into minimal ingredients and eastern herbal medicine kinda vibe then you'll like this. It's not terrible, not great. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-toner) \\- if there had to be one toner I'd recommend from the Pyunkang Yul line it'd be this one. At least it has some botanical extracts that will help your skin along with niacinamide. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [Missha Time Revolution Clear Toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-clear-toner) \\- this has been discontinued, but I liked it has a morning cleansing toner. \n* [*klairs Fundamental Ampoule Mist*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-fundamental-ampoule-mist) \\- i enjoyed this mist, it sits in a base of green tea and contains a bunch of skin soothing ingredients. The actual mister itself was alright, it didn't produce the best misting experience. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-supple-preparation-facial-toner) \\- another cult favourite. This is probably the most viscous toners I've ever tried. I probably would prefer the essential oil free version of this much more, but regardless, I still think it's a good hydrating toner to slap on. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*By Wishtrend Mandelic Acid 5% Skin Prep Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/by-wishtrend-mandelic-acid-5-skin-prep-water) \\- this was a pretty good exfoliating toner, mandelic acid is one of the gentler AHAs to begin with and having it at 5% makes it super gentle I feel. If you're wanting to dip your toes into AHA and exfoliating, this is probably a good place to start. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. This looks like it's been reformulated once, to remove the hydrolyzed collagen to make this product vegan. \n* [*Son & Park Beauty Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/son-park-beauty-water) \\- i do not like this product. I know it's a cult favourite but even then it's kinda just meh in my eyes. Fragrance free. \n* [*I'm From Rice Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-rice-toner) \\- this is basically the Laneige Cream Skin, but the rice version, if that makes sense. They're both more moisturizing than hydrating. The only con with this toner is that it requires you to shake it before each use to make sure everything is emulsified together. Overall a good choice if you're someone who is lazy with skincare, since this and the Laneige Cream Skin is a multi-step product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Innisfree Artichoke Layering Light Skin*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-artichoke-layering-light-skin) \\- this product has been discontinued. Didn't hate this product, just a simple watery toner to layer.\n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Skin*](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_248d341348.html) \\- i just don't like anything from this line. I feel like it didn't really do anything for my skin, I'm probably more harsh on products that claim to help with acne as a person who suffers from acne myself. Fragrance and essential oil free. \n* [*Etude House Soonjung pH 5.5 Relief Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-soonjung-ph5-5-relief-toner) \\- if you're looking for some basic products, for some basic skin or introductory products into skincare, I fully believe the Soonjung line is perfect for that. I also believe this now comes in a jumbo size (350ml?). Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-1025-dokdo-toner-2) \\- this is what I use on a daily basis now as a morning wiping toner. It's gentle enough to wipe away the dirt without stripping the skin. Alternatively I also think it's hydrating enough to be used as a toner that you pat into the skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Skin*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-blueberry-rebalancing-skin) \\- i probably would like this toner a lot more if it didn't contain essential oils. It's a milky looking toner, but it's not moisturizing as the Laneige or I'm From toner. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*Cosrx Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-centella-water-alcohol-free-toner) \\- i mean, this was whatever. It's a very basic mist toner, and to be honest, probably didn't do much for my skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Natural Pacific (Nacific) Real Floral Toner Calendula*](https://incidecoder.com/products/nacific-real-floral-toner-calendula) \\- i wasn't really expecting much with this toner, but it kinda proved me wrong. While I think the calendula petals in the actual bottle is kinda of a gimmick it did soothe my skin and feel rather nice on my face. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*TonyMoly The Black Tea London Classic Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/tony-moly-the-black-tea-london-classic-toner) \\- this was oddly viscous somehow, it's probably due to the cyclomethicone being in there. That being said, I didn't really enjoy this toner either. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Cosrx One Step Moisture Up Pad*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-one-step-moisture-up-pad) \\- i've also tried the original pads from cosrx and I gotta say, I just don't like pads. I think they're overpriced for what they are. The only pro is that they're good for travel. Other than that I'm just not on the pad hype train. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n\n**First Essences:**\n\n* [*Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence (Rose Edition)*](https://incidecoder.com/products/secret-key-starting-treatment-essence-rose-edition) \\- simple ingredient list, no fuss, and somewhat affordable. Now does the rose ingredients in here really make a difference, probably not, but this has a cleaner ingredient list than the standard one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Scinic First Treatment Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/scinic-first-treatment-essence) \\- if you're looking to delve into this whole fermented first essence experience. Scinic is probably the best one to start off with, simple ingredient list and affordable. \n* *the Saem The Essential Glactomyces First Essence* \\- it looks like they renewed the packaging for this and it now comes in a reddish purple bottle. The ingredients look the same though it's just 100% galactomyces ferment filtrate. Regardless, this felt oddly greasy? Maybe it's because it's just that one ingredient but it felt greasy and weird to me. Hard pass. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free. \n* *Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence (Intensive Moist & Intensive)* \\- not really a reason for me to go into this as they renew the formula every two years or so. The Intensive Moist and Intensive versions have been discontinued. And yes, I did buy the Line Friends edition simply because it looked so cute. \n* [*Benton Fermentation Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-fermentation-essence) \\- so, why is this only 100ml? Feels kinda overpriced for what it is. Regardless, I wouldn't really suggest this unless you really want to try it or you're a Benton diehard fan. Looks like it's been reformulated. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence Homme*](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-homme-the-first-treatment-essence-200ml) \\- gasp, a male marketed product? The only reason I wanted to try this instead of the regular current version was that it contains more volume, it didn't come in a glass bottle because I drop shit all the time, and it looked like it was formulated for more oily skin. In the end, this was just whatever for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-artemisia-treatment-essence) \\- ok this product is a hit. I really like this product and if you're someone who can't stand traditional eastern medicinal scent, I don't really think you'll like this. But I love how this smells and to be honest, it's probably why I like it so much. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free.\n* [*I'm From Mugwort Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-essence) \\- basically the same thing as the Missha one, but I prefer the Missha one because it's cheaper and the scent in the Missha one is stronger for some reason most likely because Missha ferments the extract? Who knows. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free.\n* [*su:m37 Secret Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/su-m37-su-m37-secret-programming-essence) \\- i don't think this is worth it, it's so expensive and ingredient list is like 50+. Plus there's a shit ton of EO in this product. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Serums:**\n\n* [*Hado Labo Gokujyun Premium*](https://incidecoder.com/products/hada-labo-gokujyun-premium) \\- so i'm sure everyone and their mom has tried something from Hado Labo at this point. If you're looking for something that is hydrating and affordable and that will help with inner dryness, this is the product for you. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence) \\- if you want to try something with snail in it just get this. Probably the most affordable one out of the bunch, probably the best one on the market still. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Mizon Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule*](https://incidecoder.com/products/mizon-snail-repair-intensive-ampoule) \\- i feel like this is another OG AB cult favourite. I mean compared to the COSRX one this one is whatever. It does contain peptides but for the price and the size it comes in, I rather just purchase the COSRX one. Fragrance and essential oil free.\n* *Missha Time Revolution Night Repair Science Activator Borabit Ampoule* \\- some of these product names are so goddamn long. Anyways this is discontinued, I believe the new ampoule is much more thicker and has prebiotics in the formula now. I also think they added EO to the new ampoule. \n* [*Skin1004 Madagascar Centella-Asiatica 100*](https://incidecoder.com/products/skin1004-madagascar-centella-asiatica-100-ampoule) \\- this product has been repackaged but the ingredients are the same, just 100% centella extract. To be honest I did enjoy this product and it's quite affordable. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-buffet-serum-3) \\- for what it is, it's fine. Probably go get the unscented version since the scent is quite strong. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Niod Multi-Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Complex*](https://incidecoder.com/products/niod-multi-molecular-hyaluronic-complex-2-mmhc2) \\- this is expensive. I rather much prefer the Marine Hyaluronics from The Ordinary. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Midnight blue Youth Activating Drop*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-midnight-blue-youth-activating-drop-3) \\- this is tiny and expensive. I like how it's a pretty blue colour, but to be honest, the size of it doesn't warrant the price. Also I had a terrible experience getting this item from Wishtrend when they had a whole batch of it go bad because it was stored at the wrong temperature. \n* [*Niod Survival 0*](https://incidecoder.com/products/niod-survival-0-2018) \\- i actually like this product! I think the orange tint that it comes in is a pit off-putting but it doesn't leave any stains or transfer or have any tint whatsoever. I think it pairs pretty well with any vitamin c product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Marine Hyaluronics*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-marine-hyaluronics) \\- is it weird that I like the smell of this? Regardless, I do prefer this much more than the traditional HA that The Ordinary also offers. I really don't see much difference with this and the MMHC2 from Niod. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-alpha-arbutin-2-ha) \\- i rather much prefer the vitamin c + alpha arbutin. This by itself is quite redundant IMO. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-niacinamide-10-zinc-1) \\- ok so this isn't the most cosmetically elegant and the formula is rather basic, but I'm not going to spend basically $60 CAD for the Paula's Choice one. I will admit the PC one is much more easier to apply, but I'm cheap. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Buffet*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-buffet) \\- this didn't really wow me, I think it's a good basic anti-aging serum.  Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-resveratrol-3-ferulic-acid-3) \\- i just mixed this in with my vitamin c to give it an additional boost, because it's sitting in a base of propanediol it doesn't give it an oily feeling, but most of TO products come sitting in a base of that. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Vitamin-C:**\n\n* [*Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-c-firma-day-serum) \\- i kinda don't get the hype over DE? I mean this was nice, but I don't think it warrants the price, plus because this uses l-ascorbic acid and it's water based it oxidizes pretty quickly, regardless of the packaging. I think there are better options out there for the fraction of the price. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-l-ascorbic-acid-powder) \\- i mean this was ok, but you can purchase bulk vitamin c powder online and do the exact same thing but cheaper? I guess this is for people who rather just mix their vitamin c into a toner or serum and call it day. I will say that this did sting the most out of all the vitamin c I've used, probably because you know, it's straight up vitamin c powder and the measuring spoon isn't the best. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside 12%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-ascorbyl-glucoside-solution-12) \\- i believe this is the only vitamin c TO offers that sits in a base of water. Regardless, this is a derivative of vitamin c so it doesn't offer the powerful punch that traditional vitamin c offers. But I did like it texturally compared to the others, since this doesn't sit in a base of propanediol. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Ole Henriksen Truth Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/olehenriksen-truth-serum) \\- i got ths as a gift so... yeah. I really don't like this. Alcohol free.\n* [*It's Skin Power 10 Formula VC Effector*](https://incidecoder.com/products/its-skin-power-10-formula-vc-effector) \\- this was also meh, pass. Alcohol and essential oil free. \n* [*Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC*](https://incidecoder.com/products/rohto-mentholatum-melano-cc-vitamin-c-essence) \\- so this is another cult favourite, while I did enjoy this, I kinda hate the packaging? I understand it's to keep the vitamin c from oxidizing, but I got a big face so I need a lot of this for my face so having to wait for each single drop to come out is a bit annoying. The amount is also quite small sitting at 20ml. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*goodal green tangerine vita C dark spot serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/goodal-green-tangerine-vita-c-dark-spot-serum) \\-  i think korea is just getting into vitamin c since I do see new products with actual l-ascorbic acid instead of citrus fruit punch with some derivatives sprinkled in there. This is citrus fruit punch and it's full of EO, so I wouldn't really recommend this. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-freshly-juiced-vitamin-drop) \\- so this would be a fine beginner vitamin c serum but it does also contain EO. Also the packaging isn't UV resistant so you need to keep this somewhere dark and away from sunlight. Probably better options out there if you're wanting to try vitamin C. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Retinols**:\n\n* [*Differin Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/differin-differin-gel) \\-  so as someone who has been on accutane three times (and a bunch of other drugs), Differin is a godsend. I know La Roche Posay now offers their version which is cheaper than Diffferin, and you can get a higher concentration of adapalene if you get a prescription. While this doesn't clear my acne 100% it's removed probably around 90% of it. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Life-flo Retinol A 1% Advanced Revitalization Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/life-flo-retinol-a-1-advanced-revitalization-cream) \\- so I bought this to see if it would help with my KP on my arms, didn't do jack shit. Unfortunately I've come to realize that severe KP is untreatable. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-granactive-retinoid-2-emulsion) \\- i prefer this the most when it comes to TO and their retinoid line. Since granactive retinoid is so new I'm not really sure if it doesn't much like tretinion and other vitamin a derivatives, but it is a moisturizing emulsion if anything. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-granactive-retinoid-5-in-squalane) \\- yeah the emulsion is better. I also cannot stand squalane oil for some reason. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Other Actives(?)**:\n\n* [*cosrx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-aha-7-whitehead-power-liquid) \\- so I'm not sure what it is, but my skin does not agree with any of the cosrx chemical exfoliants. This and the BHA one made me breakout, and I've used other AHA/BHA products before. Regardless, I resorted to using this on my arms (for my KP), didn't really do much for the KP. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) \\- read above. Also this doesn't even contain any saliycylic acid so... yeah no. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution - it looks like this product is going through reformulation currently. I'm using the Paula's Choice BHA Liquid right now and I prefer the PC one more, even if it's more expensive. \n* Benzoyl Peroxide - i mean this is just 5% benzoyl peroxide I get from my drug store. I am a strong believer of pairing benzoyl peroxide with other acne medication to make sure you're doubling down on the acne. \n\n**Oils**:\n\n* [*The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-plant-derived-squalane) \\- look i'm not the best person to review oils, since I still have generally quite oily skin. If anything oils usually get mixed into my body moisturizer to give more occlusivity. Also I hate the feeling of squalane for some reason. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-organic-cold-pressed-rose-hip-seed-oil) \\- so I bought this because people kept saying rose hip oil is good for hyperpigmentation, but yeah, my face couldn't handle the oily feeling so it went straight on my body! Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-virgin-marula-luxury-facial-oil) \\- ok why does this cost so much? I've heard this feels much more lighter than other marula oils but still, this costs an arm and a leg. Probably not really worth it. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Moisturizers**:\n\n* [*cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-oil-free-ultra-moisturizing-lotion-with-birch-sap) \\- i don't really like this. It was fine? But now that I found another birch juice/sap moisturizer that one is 100% better than this one. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha) \\- look, you cannot fault this product as it is extremely cheap ($5 for 100ml during this year's Black Friday sale), and the ingredients are decent. If you're looking for a basic moisturizer, just get this one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Emulsion*](https://incidecoder.com/products/papa-recipe-eggplant-clearing-emulsion) \\- yeah no I really don't like this line. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*cosrx Aloe Vera Oil-Free Moisture Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-aloe-vera-oil-free-moisture-cream) \\- probably better to just get an aloe vera gel if you're eyeing at this product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-rich-moist-soothing-cream) \\- i found this too heavy for my skin, plus it's filled with EO. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-midnight-blue-calming-cream-8) \\- now this cream was much better for me. While I believe it's supposed to be used a spot treatment to calm down irritated skin, I just used this all over. I also believe there is a tube format of this now if you hate jar packaging. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Mizon Black Snail All In One Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/mizon-black-snail-aio-cream) \\- not much to say about this cream, didn't really stand out to me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-birch-juice-moisturizing-cream) \\- k this is really good. If you have oily skin, I really recommend this. It kinda feels like you're applying water because the cream just melts and sinks in immediately. It's extremely hydrating and perfect for oily skin as it doesn't feel too occlusive or leave any stickiness. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-aloe-propolis-soothing-gel) \\- i mean this is a decent aloe gel, I just don't think I'm a fan of aloe gels in general as it leaves a sticky feeling behind. This would probably be best if you are sunburnt as it as a nice cooling effect on the skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Inkey List Multi-Biotic*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-inkey-list-multi-biotic) \\- this stinks, so if you do not like your moisturizer smelling like basically yogurt, then pass this one. I found it quite cool and tolerable. The scent doesn't 100% disappear but it doesn't linger if that makes sense. You really have to smell hard to actually smell it after applying it. This was just ok for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Dr. G RED Blemish Clear Soothing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-g-red-blemish-clear-soothing-cream) \\- this is really highly ranked of Hwahae so I decided to try it. I found it alright as it was occlusive but not pore clogging feeling, while it's not the most hydrating this is probably better for dryer skin types as it provides that nice seal. As for decreasing redness, I didn't really see much of a difference. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-cream) \\- didn't really do much for my acne but it is a nice gel moisturizer, not something really rave about though. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [cosrx Centella Blemish Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-centella-blemish-cream) \\- i've recommended this to so many people. I feel like this is really soothes my acne or makes them completely disappear if they're non-cystic ones. I've emptied countless jars of this and I always have one of these on me at all times. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation Perfecting Moisturizer*](https://incidecoder.com/products/olehenriksen-sheer-transformation-r-perfecting-moisturizer) \\- i don't hate this surprisingly? What really shocked me was that this was EO and fragrance free unlike their truth serum. I think this is a good morning moisturizer to pair with your vitamin c as it does contain a handful of antioxidants. A little also goes a long way as it spreads pretty well. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-lala-retro-whipped-cream) \\- i am probably the worst person to ask about DE. But once again I didn't like this product. It probably was too rich for my oily skin, I just really can't stomach the prices of their products. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Benton Fermentation Eye Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-fermentation-eye-cream-2) \\- i'm not really a believer in eye cream so I'm probably the worst person to review this, but yeah, this didn't really change my thoughts on eye creams. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Sunscreens**:\n\n* *CeraVe Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Body Lotion* \\- i think this has been discontinued as I can't find it anywhere, but this was not it. It states to have invisible zinc technology but it was still so pasty and white. I'm only tossing this because I'm pretty sure it's passed the use by date. \n* [*Murad City Skin Age Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/murad-city-skin-age-defense-broad-spectrum-spf-50-pa) \\- so this uses zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as it's filter. It's a pretty elegant physical sunscreen if you can look past the price. I think the tint helps it so that it doesn't have a white cast, at least on my skin tone. You gotta shake this before using this. One downside to this sunscreen is that it does feel greasy for me, and it's not water/sweat resistant so it will rub off with the tint. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Troiareuke Acsen U.V Protector Essence SPF 50+ PA+++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/ascen-uv-protector-essence) \\- combinational sunscreen that uses octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, tinosorb s, titanium dioxide, Univul T 150 as it's filters. The only gripe I have with this is that it does contain fragrance. It's pretty expensive as well. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50+ PA ++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-soft-airy-uv-essence-spf50-pa) \\- so this is awkward. With the whole Purito thing has shaked things up and a lot of Korean sunscreens are now under investigation for having lower than advertised SPF ratings. Univul A Plus and Univul T 150 are the filters for this sunscreen and to be honest since they've stopped the sale of this sunscreen and I'm not sure what will happen to it. We'll see how things end up with this whole debacle but I did enjoy using this if that matters at all.\n* *innisfree perfect UV protection cream triple care SPF 50+ PA+++* \\-  this has been discontinued, but god roadshop brands have the worst fragrances. I'm pretty sure I gave up using this because I could not handle the fragrance. \n* *Mamonde Everyday Aqua Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA++++* \\- again, the fragrance, why. This also has been discontinued. \n* *innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Watery Sun Cream SPF37 PA+++* \\- so this has been reformulated and repackaged, I believe it's now SPF 45 PA+++. I don't the SPF increase really changed much in the formula, it uses titanium dioxide only. But it does have EO. Also shake the product before using it. \n* [*innisfree The minimum sun cream SPF 25 PA++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-the-minimum-sun-cream-spf25-pa) \\- so, idk why I got this sunscreen. Because I think this is either meant for babies or people with extremely sensitive skin. Either way, if you're either of those, probably one to pick up. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* *Missha all-around Safe Block Mild Sun SPF 30 PA++* \\- this has been discontinued as well, once again, not sure why I got this. As it's pretty low protection and is probably meant for babies or people with extremely sensitive skin. \n* [*Etude House UV Double Cut Fresh Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA ++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-uv-double-cut-fresh-sun-gel-spf50-pa) \\- this one has a more tolerable fragrance but it's still not great. If you're ok with EO, alcohol and fragrance in your sunscreen then go ahead. It's inexpensive and does provide good coverage as it uses octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, Unival A Plus, and Univul T 150. But I really just wish brands would stop putting fragrance in their sunscreens, I'm fine with mine smelling like chemicals. \n* *Hyggee Chu Chu Sun Pact SPF43 PA+++* \\- discontinued and yes I did buy it because Pucca was on it. \n\n**Body Care**:\n\n* [*CeraVe Moisuturizing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-moisturizing-cream) \\- i'm pretty sure everyone has tried this before. To me, I think any old body moisturizer performs just as well as this one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*CeraVe Renewing SA Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-renewing-sa-cream) \\- so apparently this is supposedly too high of a pH for the salicylic acid to do much, according to Beautypedia. I bought this in hopes to combat my KP, but it didn't really do much. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*illiyoon ceramide ato 6.0 top to toe wash*](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ceramide-ato-6-0-top-to-toe-wash) \\- i do like this body wash, it's quite gentle but it doesn't produce any lather, so if you want that bubbly foam fantasy this isn't the product for you. It leaves a film behind, which apparently is what low pH cleansers feel like? But regardless, the film isn't con as I really don't notice it after awhile. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*illiyoon ultra repair moisture cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ultra-repair-moisture-cleanser) \\- i prefer their ato cleanser more, this has fragrance and I don't think the added oils in this formula moisturize my skin anymore than the ato one. Alcohol free.\n\n**Powders**:\n\n* [*innisfree no-sebum Mineral Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-no-sebum-mineral-powder-2) \\- cult favourite, but their newer powder has won over my heart. Still this is not bad as a mattifying powder. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*innisfree Pore Blur Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-pore-blur-powder) \\- so this is like a better version of the no-sebum powder. It also doesn't include fragrance! Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Masks**:\n\n* [*I'm From Mugwort Mask*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-mask) \\- this mask is great for cooling the skin down, also I'm addicted to the smell of mugwort so this was a dream come true. It's just a hassle to wash off as there are pieces of mugwort in this mask. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.",

Most supplements out there are bovine because it's cheaper, but from the journal articles I have read it seems like marine collagen has better efficacy for hair/skin/nails while bovine collagen shows better efficacy for things like cartilage and tendons. Worth exploring! I'm a dietitian and I have a scoop of marine collagen in my coffee every morning for last 4-5 months. Lately I've noticed my hair has been growing quickly and skin has also been great (no pimple patches needed in at least 3mo however in this time frame I have also increased my water intake and started a flax oil supplement daily. So perhaps some confounding factors. If nothing else, the scoop of collagen at least is a flavorless addition to my coffee that helps balance my blood sugar in the AM. ☻",

It’s the scaffolding of our skin, joints, and connective tissue, yet most people ignore it, until they start feeling the wear and tear. Supplement companies push expensive hydrolyzed collagen powders, but here’s a biohacker’s secret: you can get the same benefits from something as simple as gummy bears or gelatin (jello).\n\nBoth are rich in glycine and proline, the key amino acids that drive collagen synthesis. A recent study https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8620403/ supports the role of gelatin supplementation in improving joint health and tissue repair, especially when combined with resistance training.\n\nPair your gelatin with vitamin C to maximize absorption. Whether it’s a handful of gummy bears or a bowl of homemade jello, this simple hack can keep your joints, skin, and connective tissue in peak condition without breaking the bank.",

This is true enough. No disagreement there.\n\nBut there is an important caveat to note here:\n\nYou can get glycine from soybeans, spinach, pumpkin seeds, quinoa and mushrooms.\n\nYou can get proline from wheat germs, bamboo shoots, asparagus, chickpeas and cabbage.\n\nIt's rare to find hydroxyproline in plants but the body can synthesise it from proline when needed.\n\nCounterpoint to what I've just written: you would need to eat quite a lot of these things to hit your recommended daily amounts.\n\nCounterpoint to my own counterpoint: The body is quite efficient at synthesising all three. It can create them all from: Nitrogen (found in any amino acid), Threonine (an essential amino acid), Vitamin C and glucose/carbohydrates. That's it. \n\nThere are loads of plants based sources of threonine: soy, hemp, chia, pumpkin seeds, Quinoa, lentils, kidney beans, oats etc... \n\nI personally supplement with isolated pea protein for workouts and its a great source, with only 30g providing more than half the daily recommended threonine. I also eat loads of seeds and nuts \n\nSo, as long as you eat a varied protein rich diet and get plenty of vitamin C you should be okay and get plenty of proline, hydroxyproline and glycine.\n\nThat's my conclusion but happy to be challenged on this as I'm personally trying to learn too.\n\nEdit: I read the paper which is more about treating conditions with collagen supplementation, rather than daily supplementation for healthy people. It's good for the elderly who can't synthesise the glycine, proline and hydroxyproline as well, for certain medical conditions like osteoarthritis, for recovery situations (e.g. from wounds) and for people with compromised synthesis (e.g. people with certain protein absorption disorders).",

    "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nThis is my first post on Reddit. In this post, I'll be reviewing all the AB products I've tried since the start of my skincare journey in 2019 (primarily K-beauty products). This post may become unbearably long if I go into great detail about each product so I’ll try to keep my reviews brief. Also, this post doesn't contain reviews of the products I'm currently using as I need more time to evaluate some new products and my routine as a whole. I've listed them down below if you're curious.\n\nI really wanted to give back to the Reddit skincare community, which has been invaluable for my skin (and my wallet). I've benefited immensely from all the reviews/discussions on this thread (and at r/SkincareAddiction), and I hope that this post contributes to our shared knowledge in some way. A massive and heartfelt thank you to all the kind souls in the Reddit skincare community!\n\n**About me and my skin**: 25F. Combination with oily T-zone and dry U-zone. Not sensitive to fragrance (but will mention it in the reviews if I recall that a product was fragranced). Had mild acne in my teens and clear skin throughout college. Didn’t have a skincare routine at all and didn’t apply sunscreen (gasp!) Started getting cystic acne in my early 20s. Began a proper skincare routine in 2019 and here we are! I live in a sub-tropical region of South Asia and \"enjoy\" extreme temperatures as well as humidity during the summer and monsoon season. It's a bit difficult to purchase K-beauty and J-beauty products here due to lack of availability.\n\n**Tretinoin use**: Before I begin, I do want to introduce a caveat to to this post. Routine use of tretinoin/Retin-A (which I started in Oct 2020) had the biggest impact on my acne. I won’t go into too much detail about tret because it's a potent product for which you need to speak to a dermatologist. But I will say that even though tretinoin did the heavy lifting by forcing the closed comedones (CCs) and cystic acne to the surface, I relied a lot on AB products to hydrate, moisturize, brighten and generally soothe my skin. While tretinoin is like medication for me, I view my (mostly) AB skincare routine as much-needed self-care. Also, YMMV.\n\n# Current Skincare Routine\n\n(will post a shelfie + review in a month or so after using the products for a sufficient amount of time)\n\n* **AM**: Wash with water >> Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Toner >> locally manufactured alpha arbutin serum >> Purito Deep Sea Pure Water Cream >> Avene Day Protector UV EX SPF30 PA+++ Cream (non-AB) (OR) Purito Centella Green Level Safe Sun (trying to finish it up)\n* **PM**: Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser >> Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Toner >> Rx tretinoin >> Rx azelaic acid >> By Wishtrend: Polyphenol in Propolis 15% Ampoule >> Purito Centella Unscented Recovery Cream (OR) Etude House Soonjung Sleeping Pack 5-Panthensoside\n* **Products used occasionally with my PM routine**: Banila Co Clean It Zero Original Cleansing Balm, Krave Great Barrier Relief Serum, Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask, Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask (Berry) and Rovectin Barrier Repair Face Oil\n* Exfoliants are all non-AB.\n\nNow, on to the reviews.\n\n**Key**: HG = Holy Grail; WRP = Would Repurchase; WNRP = Would Not Repurchase; MRP = May Repurchase; (x2 or x'n') = have repurchased the product 'n' times.\n\n**Rating scale**: 1/5 – Disliked the product; 2/5 – Not impressed; 3/5 – Nice product, but better ones available; 4/5 – Really enjoyed it; 5/5 – HG, loved everything about it.\n\n# Cleansing Balm / Oil\n\n* **Banila Co. Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Revitalizing** – Love this. Of all their cleansing balms, have tried this one and the Original one. Both are fragranced but this one was a *little* more slippery and dissolvable compared to the Original. Used it for occasional makeup removal. Didn’t sting my eyes. Used it frequently for the oil cleansing method (OCM) to remove sebum plugs and flaky skin. Have successfully pushed out blackheads during OCM (but not the ones that were deeply embedded). If you oil cleanse for too long, skin can feel stripped and dry. Emulsifies easily. Doesn’t leave a film. **5/5** **HG WRP** (but don’t have a preference between this one and the Original one).\n* **The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Light Cleansing Oil** – Only cleansing oil that I’ve tried. Didn’t irritate my skin. Took off makeup well. Didn’t emulsify easily. Felt greasy even after washing off. Fragranced. **2/5** **WNRP**.\n* **The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Cream** – Worked fine for me but felt a bit greasy after washing off. Fragranced. **3/5** **WNRP**.\n\n# Cleanser\n\n* **Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser** – First low-pH cleanser that I tried. Didn’t sting skin, but skin felt stripped after washing off if it was sensitized. Tea-tree smell. **3/5** **WNRP**.\n* **Etude House SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser** – Really enjoyed this but missed the experience of gel cleansers. Didn’t strip skin. Didn’t sting sensitized skin. **4/5** **WNRP**.\n\n# Toner / Essence\n\n* **Bellamonster Stress Out Solution Pad** – I think the mild exfoliants and the cotton pad itself were supposed to target acne-prone skin. The carrot seed oil was supposed to soothe and nourish skin. But for me, it didn’t really do anything. Certainly didn’t soothe my skin. Don’t think I’m a toner pad gal. **1/5 WNRP**.\n* **Benton Aloe BHA Toner** (mini x2) – Hydrating. Has aloe water and snail secretion filtrate. Absorbs easily. Doesn’t sting sensitized skin. BHA is negligible. Enjoyed the first mini but didn’t think it would be useful in my routine (since I rely on the Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant – non-AB). Purchased a second mini when I started tret and had to stop all actives. The tret purge was leading to more blackheads than usual so I wanted to introduce a gentle BHA product before bringing the Paula’s Choice BHA back into my routine. Folks with sensitive skin may enjoy it. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence** (mini x2 and full size) – Really enjoyed this. Sinks into the skin beautifully (unlike the Cosrx Snail 96 Essence). Hydrating. Made my skin look healthy (plump, glowy). Didn’t have any impact on acne or inflammation though. **4/5 WRP**.\n* **Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** – Unpopular opinion but I’m not a big fan. Gave into the hype and bought it. Takes time to absorb into the skin. Dries with a tacky feeling. Using copious amounts made my skin look plump (and almost poreless) but after a while, skin feels dry and tight. Don’t think it deeply hydrates skin. No impact on acne, inflammation, brown acne marks/post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) or red acne marks/post-inflammatory erythema (PIE). No scent. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx Natural BHA Skin Returning A-Sol** – Didn’t do anything. Watery texture. Strong alcohol smell. **1/5 WNRP**.\n* **Etude House Moistfull Collagen Essence** – Didn’t have a hydrating product in my routine when I purchased this. Didn’t have access to a lot of AB products due to global COVID lockdowns. Wasn’t bad but nothing to write home about. Sinks into the skin well. Doubt that hydrolyzed collagen in cosmetic products that you apply to your epidermis are effective in increasing collagen. Strong alcohol smell. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **I’m From Mugwort Essence** – Really enjoyed this. Lightweight. Sinks into skin easily. Very hydrating. Didn’t see any anti-inflammatory effects or reduction in redness though. Definitely missed this when it finished but can’t justify the price for a product which didn’t do much more than hydrate my skin. **4/5 WNRP**.\n* **Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Skin** – Bought this when I demolished my moisture barrier. Had read good reviews about this and skin was super dehydrated at that point. Product ended up being light, yet hydrating. Didn’t sting skin despite having citrus oils. Have found better hydrating products now. Citrus smell. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner (mini and full size)** – Really enjoyed this. Despite being viscous, it absorbed into my skin pretty easily. Super hydrating. Stung when skin was sensitized though. Has a scent. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner** – Didn’t enjoy this as much as the scented version. Ingredient list is the same except for the plant/fruit extracts in the scented version (as far as I remember). Didn’t realize I would miss those plant/fruit extracts. Didn’t feel as hydrating as the scented version. Also thought that this one was not as viscous as the scented version (but I have read reviews where people didn’t think there was a difference in terms of texture). Folks with sensitive skin would enjoy this. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Laneige Cream Skin Refiner** – Mixed feelings. Wow innovation but also tricky to fit into routine. Watery when you apply, but becomes nourishing when it meets your skin. Using this immediately after cleansing would make it feel like I was applying my serums on top of a moisturizer. Skin felt wonderfully nourished though, especially during the winters. Pre-COVID, couldn’t use it in the morning as it's definitely greasy for oily/combo skin people. Would sting when applied on red, sensitized skin. I enjoyed this product for the most part, but I’ve realized that I want my toner/essence step to be light and hydrating. **4/5 WNRP**.\n* **Rovectin Skin Essentials Treatment Lotion** – Unpopular opinion again but not a fan. Didn’t sink into skin easily. Always felt like there was a film on my face. Skin felt hydrated but I didn’t enjoy the application of other products (serums, in particular) after applying this one. Didn’t sting sensitized skin. No scent. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence (Rose Edition)** – Everything about this product is lovely, right from the packaging to the product itself. Absorbs into the skin easily. Feels super light, yet hydrating. This product is a first treatment essence (FTE) and it’s supposed to be applied immediately after cleansing and before other products. It has fermented ingredients (94% galactomyces ferment filtrate a.k.a galactic mice) and helps other products penetrate better. Had heard so much about the elusive FTE glow, and was thrilled to see it. To clarify, it doesn’t help with PIH or PIE but it makes your skin look brighter and healthier. **4/5** **but WNRP** because I do want to try out other FTEs like the original Missha one and Neogen.\n\n# Serum / Ampoule\n\n* **Benton Snail Bee Ultimate Serum** – Thought I would like this better than the Benton Snail Essence. Did not, in fact, like this better. Wasn’t as hydrating as the Benton Snail Essence. Didn’t do anything for my skin. Taking into account its ineffectiveness, super expensive for the volume. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot Serum** – This one…. Apparently, it’s all the rage in S. Korea. Loved the texture; face felt super nourished when I used it in the AM. Didn’t do anything for PIH though. Zero, zilch, nada. Takes some time to sink into the skin. Citrus scent. **3/5 MRP** because I enjoyed the experience of using this product.\n* **Innisfree Green Tea Seed Face Serum** – I don’t get the hype. This was an ‘entry-into-AB’ kind of product. Didn’t do anything for my skin. Strong alcohol smell. **1/5 WNRP**.\n* **It’s Skin Power 10 Formula VC Effector Serum** – First Vitamin C serum. Has a Vitamin C derivative but I’m not sure which one. Didn’t brighten skin or lighten PIH. Mildly hydrating. Absorbed into the skin really quickly. Not expensive but not effective either. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **It’s Skin Power 10 Formula Q10 Effector** – I suppose the effects of Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10 show themselves in the long run, so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this product. Q10 is an anti-oxidant and is supposed to prevent damage to the skin from environmental stressors and UV rays (cannot replace sunscreen though). The product was lightweight and absorbed easily. Affordable. Would be interested in trying out other Q10 products. **3/5 WNRP.**\n* **Iunik Propolis Vitamin Synergy Serum** – Took me forever to finish this because there was 50ml of product, and the product itself was thick in texture (have read that most propolis-based serums have this kind of texture). Skin felt nourished after applying it. A bit heavy and sticky so had to apply at night. Didn’t see the ‘propolis glow’. Enjoyed it, but didn’t really need it in my routine. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Serum** (mini and full size) – Tried out the mini when my skin was doing okay in terms of redness and sensitivity. Sinks into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave a tacky feeling. I want to say that this product is hydrating but I don’t think it can help with the deep hydration that folks with dehydrated skin need. Purchased the full size when it was on sale, and at the time, my skin was super sensitized (thanks tret). This stung oh man and I don’t know why. Was disappointed with the soothing and calming claims of this product. Didn't detect a scent. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop** (x2) – Has 5% ascorbic acid. Wasn’t potent enough to help with PIH. But did brighten by complexion and make it more glowy. Didn’t throw away the box it came in and stored the bottle in the box while I was using it; didn’t oxidize at all (over a period of \\~3.5 months). Feels like a dry oil. Takes some time to absorb into the skin, but it’s not greasy. Interested in trying out vitamin C at higher concentrations. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum** – Purchased it when my skin was sensitized from over-exfoliation (which is a rite of passage for all skincare enthusiasts). This product stung. Didn’t notice the impact of the 49% centella asiatica extract because it hurt to use this. Absorbs easily into the skin though and doesn’t leave a tacky finish. Would be interested in trying out the Unscented version; maybe that won’t sting and I’ll enjoy it more. **2/5 WNRP**.\n\n# Exfoliant\n\n* **Cosrx AHA Whitehead Power Liquid** – Glycolic acid is not for me. I think this has 7% glycolic acid. Stung every time I applied it, regardless of whether skin was sensitized or not. Didn’t notice a reduction in CCs or acne (mostly because my skin would feel sensitive after applying the product and it would give rise to inflamed bumps). This is less about the product and more about my skin apparently holding a grudge against glycolic acid. No scent. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid** – Felt pretty gentle on my skin. Didn’t have an impact on stubborn CCs or on blackheads. Worked well on sebaceous filaments on the nose though. Prefer the Paula’s Choice BHA to this 100%. Product has a slip to it. Leaves a film on the skin when it dries down. No scent. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Neogen Bio-peel Gauze Peeling Wine** – Bought it because it was on sale. After using it on my face and my body, I can safely say that it’s not a good idea to put physical exfoliants in my hand because I don’t know how to be gentle with my skin. It’s essentially a pad with a soft quilted side and a more abrasive gauze side. Took me so long to finish up this product. Has a fruity scent. **2/5** **WNRP**.\n\n# Moisturizer / Sleeping Pack\n\n* **Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel** (mini) – Didn’t do anything for my skin, i.e., hydrate, nourish or soothe. Skin felt tight after using. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Benton Snail Bee High Content Steam Cream** (mini) – Face felt greasy and suffocated. Product didn’t seem to absorb at all. Skin did feel moisturized but the experience using this product was unpleasant. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx Advanced Snail 92 All in One Cream** – Felt calming and soothing on my over-exfoliated skin. But the application was annoying because of the unique texture of this product. Didn’t feel heavy or unbearably greasy. But didn’t fully absorb into my skin either. Think I would have enjoyed it more if the texture was airy and light (if that makes any sense). No fragrance. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx Hydrium Green Tea Aqua Soothing Gel Cream** – Used this in the summer. Maybe gel creams just aren’t for me. Not hydrating or moisturizing enough. While skin didn’t feel very tight, it certainly seemed to crave nourishment after a couple of hours. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx Ultimate Nourishing Honey Overnight Mask** – Worked well in the summer as a sleeping pack, but wasn’t thick enough for the winters. Doesn’t feel heavy on the skin at all. Feels like you’re applying a gel cream. I don’t know if it’s actually nourishing or if it just does a good job of acting like an occlusive and the rest of your skincare does the heavy lifting in terms of nourishment and moisturization. Dried down pretty quickly. **3/5 MRP**.\n* **Etude House SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream** (x2) – Love this during the winters. It’s perfectly basic but that’s why it’s great. Has a soft mousse-like texture but will embrace your face in a warm hug on application. Skin felt moisturized. Used it while adjusting to tret and it didn’t sting sensitized skin at all. Not greasy but because of how moisturizing it is, you certainly know that it’s there on your face. Didn’t cause CCs for me. No fragrance. **5/5 HG WRP**. But at the moment, I’m interested in trying out the Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Pack.\n* **Etude House SoonJung Hydro Barrier Cream** – Thought this would be the answer to all my day-time moisturizer problems. But it wasn’t. Instead of feeling moisturized, skin just felt greasy. It was almost like there was a waxy layer on top of my skin. Texture was mousse-like. **1/5 WNRP**.\n* **Innisfree Aloe Vera Revital Soothing Gel** – I used this product as a mask more than a moisturizer. ~~It has alcohol but I think that allows it to~~ Sinks into the skin really well. Mildly hydrating. It’s not amazing but quite cost-effective for the amount you get. Not expensive. Don't really need it in my routine though. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Cream** (x2) – Great product. Can easily use it as a day-time moisturizer. Skin didn't feel greasy at all despite the fact that this is a cream. Didn’t sting my sensitized skin but it does have essential oils, so do take that into account. The cream itself is light and spreads very easily. Light citrus smell. **4/5 WRP**.\n* **Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream** (60 ml) – Product colour is beautiful. Didn’t do much for my skin in terms of soothing or calming. When my skin was really sensitized (thanks tret), sometimes this product would sting. Didn’t have an impact on redness or inflammation of cystic acne. Balm-like texture but not as heavy as a sleeping pack. Felt like there was a waxy film on my skin. May work for people who aren’t trying to address intense inflammation of the skin. Expensive but not effective. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Purito Centella Green Level Recovery Cream** – Just like the Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum, purchased this product to deal with over-exfoliated skin. Brand claims that it’s been formulated with 50% centella asiatica extract. But unfortunately, it also has essential oils. I’m not a 100% sure but I think that’s what caused it to sting on application. If you use this product when your moisture barrier is okay, I don’t think it should cause any issues. But people typically purchase ‘recovery creams’ and ‘cica creams’ when they’re trying to repair their skin. Thankfully, the brand has come out with an Unscented version that doesn’t have essential oils (testing that out right now). **2/5 WNRP**.\n\n# Sunscreen\n\n* **Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++** – Won’t comment on the effectiveness of this since I don’t think it’s been tested after the Purito controversy (Wishtrend has stopped sales though). Texture-wise it felt light on my face, but made my forehead greasy. Didn’t enjoy using it due to that reason and took forever to begrudgingly finish it up. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun SPF 50+ PA++++** – We all know about the controversy, so I won’t get into it. Texture-wise I thought this was a little greasier than the Scented version of this sunscreen. I think that people with combo or oily skin are more sensitive to products that can make them look greasy, that is, they’re more likely to notice the greasiness of the product. I don’t think that the greasiness would bother people with dry skin as much. **3/5 but WNRP** because I feel betrayed (and I don’t want an ‘indoor sunscreen’; I just want one effective sunscreen).\n\n# Wash-Off Mask\n\n* **I’m From Mugwort Mask** (mini) – Magically zapped away the redness on my face that usually shows up when I’m using too many actives or I’ve put too much pressure while cleansing. It does have plant bits in it though and some of these particles are sharp. But if you’re careful washing it off, don’t think it will be a problem. Doesn’t dry down and easy to wash off. Smells like mugwort, that is to say, herbal and medicinal. Don’t know if I can justify the price point and purchase a full-size version just to address redness though. **4/5 MRP** because I’m greedy.\n* **I’m From Honey Mask** (mini x3) – Really wanted to love this. Applying it is just the most luxurious feeling ever. Smells divine (though people sensitive to fragrance may not like the smell). The problem is that it’s too expensive for me, and doesn’t really moisturize or nourish my skin as much as I’d like it too. Sometimes, my skin would still feel a bit dry after washing it off. Has a thick caramel-like texture and doesn’t dry down. Can be worn up to an hour. I did wear it for over 2 hours once because I accidentally fell asleep with it on and I would not recommend doing that; my skin felt super sensitive once I washed it off. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Innisfree Super Volcanic Clay Mousse Mask 2x** – Love this product. I used it occasionally as it's pretty drying (like most clay masks). The mousse-like texture helped me spread it over my face without having to tug at my skin. Also like the fact that it doesn’t come in a jar/tub and instead, comes in a spray-type can. I'd typically leave it on for 15 minutes and it would suck up all the sebum on my face. Made my pores (particularly the ones on my nose) look cleaner. **5/5 HG but** **WNRP** because I’ve been trying out the 10 ml Innisfree Capsule Recipe Pack (Volcanic Cluster) and that one doesn’t dry down at all. Would be interested in using more of that product.\n\n# Sheet Masks\n\nI use them occasionally. They’re all pretty interchangeable to me so I won’t be able to review them properly. I use sheet masks on two occasions – one, when my skin is struggling despite my skincare routine and I need that instant boost of hydration or instant soothing, and two, when I feel bored with my skincare routine and am on the verge of unnecessarily splurging on hyped up products for no reason. I’ve enjoyed the sheet masks from The Face Shop, Innisfree, Ariul, Mediheal, Tonymoly, Leaders, Klairs and Etude House.\n\nAnd with that, we come to the end of the post. I hope this was helpful! It seems like I've gone through A LOT of products (\\*cue weeping wallet\\*), but the heart wants what it wants. Some new products that I have my eye on (because I will never learn) are the Cosrx Propolis Synergy Toner, Missha Artemisia Essence, Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Pack, By Wishtrend's 15% Vitamin C, Tiam's Vitamin C serum and Muji cleansing oils. Can't wait to hear your thoughts!\n\n(Edit: formatting and typos)\n\n(Edit 2: **Innisfree Aloe Vera Revital Soothing Gel doesn't have alcohol!** Relied on the ingredients listed on a local retailer's page instead of incidecoder/cosdna, apologies. Thank you to a commenter for pointing it out!)",

    "body": "I’ve seen a few posts lately about collagen supplements and as a cell biologist I’d like to shed some light on how collagen is actually produced within your skin and why collagen supplements are likely a waste of money. Please let me know if you have any questions about anything to do with collagen or fibroblasts, since this is what my Ph.D. is all about (not in regards to skincare though, sorry XD)!\n\nAs you are likely aware, your skin is composed of several layers of different types of tissue. [The outermost layer is known as the stratum corneum and immediately underneath is the epidermis](https://s3.amazonaws.com/classconnection/566/flashcards/7417566/jpg/basic-anatomy-of-the-skin-epidermis-dermis-stratum-corneum-fibroblasts-14FFDE1D09B1AB28F8C.jpg), which has its own unique anatomy that I won’t go into detail for now. As /u/kjj17 pointed out, the stratum corneum is actually part of the epidermis.\n\nBelow the epidermis is the dermis, and this is the layer that has the structural layer of collagen which we are all concerned about maintaining and protecting. Within the dermis, the cells that produce collagen are called **fibroblasts**, and these cells synthesize many different types of collagen proteins which are then transported into the area outside of the cell, called the **extracellular matrix (ECM)**. The ECM essentially holds everything together and supports all cells, so when your ECM starts to break down this is when you get [wrinkles due to the tissue not being able to “snap back” to its original state](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4015970). \n\nCollagen type I is the main constituent of collagen within the skin, and is [composed of three amino acid chains coiled together to form a triple helix](http://www.reasons.org/Media/Default/Article/image001.png). [The actual collagen fibrils you can see under a microscope using special dyes]( https://image.slidesharecdn.com/09-10-08-m-velkey-connectivetissue-110613095349-phpapp01/95/091008-connective-tissue-9-728.jpg?cb=1310386280) are actually many triple helices all bound together. To make collagen, the fibroblasts first produce these amino acid chains which are then turned into a triple helix and transported outside of the cell where the helix undergoes several other modifications and is then able to assemble with other helices to form [fibrils]( http://www.anatomybox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/collagen-fibrils.jpg). \n\nWhile your fibroblasts are working hard to produce collagen, the collagen already established in the ECM also needs to be regulated otherwise you would get hard tissue akin to a scar. There are enzymes called **matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)** that are able to break down collagen through hydrolysis. Hydrolyzed collagen is known as gelatin, and there are other MMPs that will break down gelatin into amino acids. \n\n**The reason why taking collagen in dried protein supplement form doesn’t contribute directly to collagen within your skin is because the acid in your stomach also turns collagen into gelatin**.  As /u/giraffesyeah also pointed out topical collagen doesn't do anything either because the collagen molecule is too large to get through the skin. \n\nIf you’re in need of more quantity or variation of protein in your diet then sure the supplements will work but there are cheaper ways to do this. Also, collagen type I is made up mainly of lysine and proline, so if you increase the amount of these specific amino acids in your diet it may be beneficial, but I haven’t seen any super convincing reports yet.\n\n**How to increase skin ECM collagen**  \n\nIn the end your best bet is vitamin C. If you add vitamin C to fibroblasts, [they will produce not only more collagen] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC319462/pdf/pnas00656-0253.pdf) but it will be [thicker and more structured as well]( http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9026/figures/2). A thicker and tighter collagen matrix will also help prevent those pesky MMPs from digging into your ECM and will reduce their rate of digestion due to a decreased probability of binding to their target protein. \n\nAnother way collagen is increased is through mechanical stimulation. All cells are receptive to different types of physical forces. Fibroblasts are most responsive to stretch, meaning that facial massage may actually be a beneficial part of your routine! /u/kjj17 noted you have to be careful about how you do this. AFAIK it is more about the pressure on the tissue (which will stretch deeper tissue) since you want to avoid pulling your skin too much so use an oil cleanser or lotion or oil. Another point to note - while cells are mechanically responsive, they require a prolonged or consistent stimulation in order to elicit a tissue remodeling response. So this means that while massage may be beneficial, it would have to be frequent and consistent to activate the pathways that relay a signal to the ECM or other cells.\n/u/kjj17 also mentioned that retinoids will also help thicken your skin. \n\n\n**UV damage**\n\nAs you may have already guessed, ultraviolet light not only [destroys collagen fibrils]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002434), but it also [kills fibroblasts cells]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167881785900598). If you’ve been reading everything so far, I think you can deduce why we always advocate for sunscreen use!\n\n\n**Important note:** As many people pointed out, you can only absorb so much vitamin c per day. Excess will be removed via urine to an extent. If you go totally nuts with it and take like 2000mg per day everyday you're gonna have a bad time cause your kidneys can't keep up with that madness. ",

        "body": "Great post. I'm going to add a small note because I saw somebody in another thread claiming they took collagen supplements to add more protein into their diet- there used to be a lot of discussion of this over at /r/keto (low carb diet) and eating collagen-rich foods, while it can be good for health, and is not BAD for you, is no substitute for eating complete proteins.\n\nVegetarians often find it difficult to consume enough protein. I was vegetarian and vegan for a long time- it's usually a question of convenience more than anything. But adding collagen is not like eating protein- it's an incomplete protein that when consumed only offers a few of the essential amino acids (as OP pointed out) so it's really a bad idea to take collagen and mentally sort that into \"protein supplementation.\" For anyone struggling to eat more protein, a protein shake would be a better option. I eat a lot of meat (low-carb here) but my bf eats mostly vegetarian therefore I cook a lot of tofu and eggs but I know how challenging it can be. Sorry to piggyback I was just concerned with someone's comment in another thread.",

As far as I know, what Vitamin C does in the role of synthesizing collagen is that it helps prep the polypeptide chain for cross-linking (forming the helix). The amino acid proline is converted to hydroxyproline, and Fe (Iron) is a cofactor in this rxn. Hydroxyproline is what twists the polypeptide chains together. What Vit. C does is acts as a reducing agent to convert Fe to a reduced state allowing it to be used again for more rxns, therefore more polypeptide chains cross-link forming helices and ultimately collagen synthesis. Probably more than you wanted to know, but just FYI.",

But a lot of these \"coffee scrub\" companies want customers to think that you can absorb caffeine through the skin - which as far as I know, you can't, at least by just rubbing coffee grounds on yourself. But you can through your stomach. The only bioavailability study I saw for vitamin c was for absorption through the stomach - not skin - but I've also heard that only vitamin c esters are the only kind of vitamin c that can be absorbed through skin. \n\nI know there's complication equations and not much study into skincare bioavailability but I would love to just be able to wrap my head around it all someday.",

Here is a [full study](http://www.jmnn.org/article.asp?issn=2278-1870;year=2015;volume=4;issue=1;spage=47;epage=53;aulast=Borumand) done in 2015 that suggests nutritional supplementation may have an effect. \n\nNow granted, 8% isn't a massive decrease in wrinkle depth, and I personally find it annoying that they doctored up a concoction with more than one ingredient they considered to be active, but they do mention a couple other relevant studies at the end. Also, they didn't control for the overall diet of the participants of the pretty small sample size, so it's possible that any supplementation at all would have had a beneficial effect on skin health. \n\nAll of that having been said, I think there's pretty strong evidence in a general sense that nutrition plays a role in skin health and quality, all other medical, genetic, and environmental issues aside. I think if your diet is strong in nutrients (leafy greens, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and so forth), supplementation is probably not going to have a noticeable effect. However, the Standard American Diet is notoriously abysmal, so I think those people who don't consume a bunch of antioxidants, trace minerals, vitamins and so forth might see a noticeable effect when supplementing their diet. \n\nAs far as stimulating collagen production in other ways, controlled damage ranging from microdermabrasion to various forms of laser and stimulation via light therapy have all been shown to improve collagen production. Obviously the things I'm mentioning here have different methods of action, but I mean...fraxel, IPL and such definitely works. Hell, skinpen works. Even microdermabrasion seems to initiate a wound-healing cascade that results in more collagen (although the literature on it leans more towards aggressive microdermabrasion rather than light treatments and is sort of thin at best). Out of reading...a whole bunch of crap...the tl;dr on it is that if you damage your skin it will produce more collagen in the healing process. I've also seen pretty interesting indication that loading your skin with antioxidants after controlled damage enhances the outcome. Then there are the hotly debated (?) peptide formulations that are hanging around. \n\nPersonally I think that between diet, lifestyle, the environment, genetic factors and topical applications, it's very hard to say what will or won't show an improvement in the skin for a particular individual. Even if one thing or another does nothing, I'm a pretty big fan of the placebo effect. I would rather somebody shell out some cash because they swear a product is doing something if it makes them feel happy and confident, even if nothing clinically significant is happening, than have them feel hopeless and depressed about their skin.",

If only there was an easy way to up the collagen back again, as I feel like this is the primary cause of a 'falling' face, which I find much more indicative of aging than wrinkles or age spots.\n\nI wish we're close to where increasing skin collagen to the degree where you completely negate the slowing of its production as you age is something possible - a very selfish and vain thought - but nonetheless one that crosses my mind every now and then.",

You said that hydrolyzed collagen supplements won't help the skin because the collagen is turned to gelatin by the acid in the stomach. So does that mean that the hydrolyzed collagen supplements also wouldn't be that effective for joints? Thanks for such an informative post!",

You talked about bioavailability and how collagen gets turned into gelatin in you stomachs. I've heard about taking collagen supplements and collagen injections for your joints, cartilage problems and even soft tissue lesions like tendinosis. What's your opinion on that? Could they really be beneficial?",

        "body": "I did some research on collagen because I was (and still am) supplementing with plain old gelatin(knox), which **is** broken down into peptides and delivered throughout your body. BTW gelatin must be mixed in a hot drink or it gets kinda gross. Hydrolyzed collagen, found in many drink supplements, does not have this problem.\nI heard a lot of conflicting info on collagen so I had to get an answer for myself, by reading like 20 research studies on ingesting collagen. The short answer is, yes, collagen, or at least the smaller peptides it is broken down into, do help skin (and joints, gut ect). Gelatin and Hydrolyzed collagen are broken down by the digestive system into amino acids **and** smaller peptides. Our gut has peptide transporters capable of moving these peptides throuought our body. I learned that in my research.  Drinking collagen increased hyaluronic acid production increased cell proliferation in the skin and much more. \n\nI made a youtube video https://youtu.be/u3R99u6F0hE and I wrote an article http://www.gotchaguys.com/drinkcollagen/ about what the science says regarding ingesting collagen, if you want more details.\n\nThe study I relied on the most for this was http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1346-8138.2010.00827.x/pdf   and the first line of the abstract reads \n\n\"Orally ingested collagen undergoes degradation to small di- or tripeptides, which are detected in circulating blood\n2 h after ingestion.\"",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "**UPDATE**\nI got a lot of comments saying this is seborrheic dermatitis. **What I had was NOT Seborrheic dermatitis.** SB takes a long time to heal and almost never goes away. It is difficult to treat. What I had went away in ~6 shampoos and has never come back. It was a yeast infection, just as the dermatologist diagnosed. Just wanted to clarify.\n\n---\n\nIf you have dry flaky skin, and maybe some dry flaky scalp, you might actually have the yeast infection known as dandruff! The dermatologist examined my skin (dry and flaky, prone to breakouts) and scalp (slightly flaky, but not that bad: nothing I would have sought treatment for independently). She noted the extra flakes on my forehead (where my hair touches my skin) and in my nose creases, and the fact that no amount of moisturizing has made any difference for me, and prescribed a dandruff shampoo that I would also use as a facewash. Apparently dandruff is actually a type of yeast infection!\n\n**Background:**\n\nI've been a member of this subreddit for about a year, self-identified as having \"dry\" skin with some flakes. My skin generally feels dull and listless, and I struggle with little acne breakouts all the time.\n\nI started with the Beginner's Routine, and slowly added products (patch-testing, of course) until I had this routine:\n\nMorning:\n\n* Splash with water\n* Paula's Choice BHA (~2x a week, waiting 30 mins before proceeding))\n* Moisturizer CeraVe in the tub (sometimes)\n* Elta MD 46 facial sunscreen (everyday)\n\nEvening:\n\n* OCM w/ jojoba oil (most nights)\n* CeraVe foaming cleanser (other nights)\n* If I washed with CeraVe I would use St. Ives' AHA pads, waiting 30 mins before proceeding)\n* Moisturizer CeraVe in the tub\n* Petroleum jelly\n\nNo matter what my routine was, my skin really never changed: it was always dry-feeling, dull, listless, flaky, and prone to breakouts.\n\n\n**Now**:\n\nI've only used the shampoo once (she told me to wash my face with it too), but my skin already feels soft and supple instead of dry and flaky - it feels... almost wet and sticky to me now, but in a good way. Like how the rest of my skin feels - no longer grainy, dry and flaky!\n\nWe'll see how it goes long-term, but thought I'd mention the concept of dandruff as yeast infection for others!\n\n**EDIT:**\nThe active ingredient in the shampoo is 2% ketoconazole. The prescription version of the shampoo cost $7 (it's the generic version, I don't think the price had anything to do with my not-so-great insurance). It's called \"Perrigo\". Here's the full ingredient list:\n\n* ketoconazole 2%\n* coconut fatty acid diethanolamide\n* disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n* FD & C Red No. 40\n* hydrochloric acid\n* imidurea\n* laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen\n* PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate\n* purified water\n* sodium chloride \n* sodium hydroxide\n* sodium lauryl ether sulfate",

It was constantly red, inflamed, itchy, and the mild flaky spots had taken over my entire face. I finally went to see a dermatologist and she diagnosed me with sebhorreic dermatitis and informed me that all of the oil and petroleum I had been smothering on my face every night was actually making my condition worse.

    "body": "I had high expectations for these bars given their excellent reputation in the West - and they did not disappoint. Most of these bars were good, and some were very, very good. Similar to Mars and Grenade, they are much closer to chocolate bars in both taste and texture, unlike Quest and Carman’s with a more ‘functional’ protein bar feel. I like that Barebells had no noticeable protein powder taste, and that most of their bars had a good balance and weren’t too sweet. I’ve ranked them according to taste and texture again below.\n\nThe soft protein bars lined up on the right are an upgrade in both taste and texture, even after I had to refrigerate them. They’re supposed to be softer and fluffier, but got butchered through shipping to the province and arrived in a flat and melted state huhu. I imagine they would’ve been similar to 3 Musketeers - firm, soft to bite into, and with the right amount of chew. The two [9.5]s were so perfect in flavor that they would likely be a [10.0] if they had held their intended shape and texture. \n\nThese bars have 200 calories on average. The soft bars have a lower protein content at 16g versus the original bars at 20g, and they also have more sugar alcohols at 9 to 10g versus the originals’ 5 to 7g. I’ve included macros and ingredients for a couple bars at the bottom. Their website says that Barebells products do not contain added sugar. I did not experience any stomach discomfort or throat irritation with these bars\n\nI purchased the original protein bars from a WiseChoice physical store for P190.00 each. Yes, I know - ripperino. It stung and I had my reservations, but decided that this would be one brand I was willing to pay in full for because of the overwhelming positive reviews online. For the soft protein bars, I ordered them through Shopee for around P165.00 each after discounts.\n\n\n**RANKINGS**\n\n**[9.5] Rocky Road Marshmallow** – chocolate base, marshmallow layer, peanut bits, crisps, milk chocolate coating. delicious bar with amazing texture. great even after refrigerating, peanuts and crisps did wonders. \n\n**[9.5] Salted Peanut Caramel** – nougat / peanut (?) base, salted peanut crunch, caramel syrup, milk chocolate coating. these peanut / peanut butter protein bars have become unexpected favorites of mine and they just keep on giving. the saltiness in the peanut crunch was popping, making this the best peanut-flavoured bar for me\n\n**[9.5] Creamy Crisp** – fluffy base, caramel, crisps, milk chocolate coating. core was straight-up delicious and i’ve got a soft spot for bars with crisps. easily my favorite from the original protein bar line\n\n**[9.0] Salty Peanut** – soft base with a little chew, peanut bits, milk chocolate coating. saltiness was faint, but the bar still delivers. another bar with that Snickers vibe - in a good way!\n\n**[8.5] Caramel Choco** – chocolate base, caramel syrup, milk chocolate coating. stuck to the basics and nailed it. reminds me of Jack n Jill Chooey Toffees i adored as a kid\n\n**[8.0] Cookies & Caramel** – cookie / chocolate base, caramel, crisps, milk chocolate coating. light but pleasant caramel taste, familiar flavors that held up well\n\n**[8.0] Banana Dream** – banana base, caramel, milk chocolate coating. texture is as basic as it gets but the typical banana food flavour was pleasant, something different from the usual chocolate and caramel options\n\n**[8.0] Chocolate Dough** – chocolate brownie (?) base, choco crisps, milk chocolate coating. rich chocolate flavors that satisfy\n\n**[7.5] Caramel Cashew** – caramel base, cashew bits, milk chocolate coating. i liked the cashew bits - i wish there were more, and the caramel flavor was too subtle for my liking, but still a solid pick\n\n**[7.5] White Chocolate** – caramel (?) base, white chocolate coating, almond pieces. white chocolate coating was delicious but somewhat crumbly. the almond and cashew pieces from the bar above were a nice change from the usual crisp texture that i enjoy\n\n**[7.0] Birthday Cake** – vanilla base with sprinkles, crunchy toppings, white chocolate coating. not exactly partial to the birthday cake flavor, but i did like this over Quest’s. noticeably sweeter than other Barebells\n\n**[6.5] Cookies & Cream** – cookie dough base, cookie bits, crisps, milk chocolate coating. decent enough, had those toppings i usually enjoy, but wasn’t eager to finish this one for some reason. this was the first Barebells bar i had and maybe the expectations were initially set too high from all the reviews, or maybe it was the core that was average\n\n\n**MACROS & INGREDIENTS**\n\nMarshmallow Rocky Road - 209 kcal 10F 17P 17C\n\nINGREDIENTS: Milk proteins, sweeteners (maltitol, xylitol, sucralose), humectant (glycerol), hydrolyzed collagen, cocoa butter, bulking agent (polydextrose), whole milk powder, peanuts, soy protein, cocoa mass, soluble corn fibre, soy oil, sunflower oil, fat reduced cocoa, salt, flavourings, emulsifier (soy lecithin), tapioca starch. May contain cereals containing gluten, egg, nuts and sesame seeds.\n\nCreamy Crisp - 200 kcal 8F 20P 19C\n\nINGREDIENTS: Milk proteins, humectant (glycerol), sweeteners (maltitol, sucralose), collagen hydrolysate, polydextrose, cocoa butter, water, cocoa mass, whole milk powder, soy protein, sunflower oil, flavourings, tapioca starch, salt, emulsifier (lecithins). May contain cereals containing gluten, peanuts and nuts.\n\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n\nOverall, Barebells lived up to the hype. The higher quality ingredients were apparent, even in the most basic bar - especially their chocolate coatings. Their good selection, decent macros, solid textures, and more than satisfying flavors have them currently sitting at the top of my list. However, they are expensive and not as widely available. I expect to buy these again only if they go on sale, or if I somehow end up with eff-you money.\n\nMy favorites to date from the protein bars I’ve covered are Quest S’mores and Double Chocolate Chunk, the flavoured Snickers Hi-Protein bars, Grenade’s Oreo, Oreo White, and White Chocolate Salted Peanut, and Barebells Rocky Road Marshmallow, Salted Caramel Peanut, Salty Peanut, and Creamy Crisp.\n\n**P.S.** Shitty weather kept me from work, so I had time to experiment with my elementary creativity. Do they look weird without the backgrounds? Also, sorry for the messy photos of the original Barebells bars - these were taken before I started photographing them more consistently (no wrapper, and without a chunk bitten off hehe) Let me know if you have protein bar recommendations! My side quest has me covering brands with at least 6 flavors, with Carman’s next on the list.\n",

    "body": "I try to guide my decisions on science (you know the stickers, \"science is real\").\n\nVindicta is gone, IDK how ppl here feel about long and boring research, but I still like to share my findings - so why not here? If it bother anyone, let me know and I'll post somewhere else.\n\nHere's why I eat gelatin, and why you may want to do the same.\n\n# Evidence\n\nFor maximum skin health, collagen helps, as proved in one of the gold standard of science, systematic reviews: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30681787/\n\n> Findings: Eleven studies with a total of 805 patients were included for review. Eight studies used collagen hydrolysate, 2.5g/d to 10g/d, for 8 to 24 weeks, for the treatment of pressure ulcers, xerosis, skin aging, and cellulite. Two studies used collagen tripeptide, 3g/d for 4 to 12 weeks, with notable improvement in skin elasticity and hydration. Lastly, one study using collagen dipeptide suggested anti-aging efficacy is proportionate to collagen dipeptide content. Conclusions and Relevance: Preliminary results are promising for the short and long-term use of oral collagen supplements for wound healing and skin aging. Oral collagen supplements also increase skin elasticity, hydration, and dermal collagen density. Collagen supplementation is generally safe with no reported adverse events. Further studies are needed to elucidate medical use in skin barrier diseases such as atopic dermatitis and to determine optimal dosing regimens\n\nOnly a meta analysis could be of higher degree of proof.\n\nIt's not just collagen, some other things might help, as this is also found in \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6835901/ where added things like Vitamin C and E, Zinc and Biotin:\n\n> The test product significantly improved skin hydration, elasticity, roughness, and density. The differences between the verum group and the placebo group were statistically significant for all test parameters. These positive effects were substantially retained during the follow-up. The measured effects were fully consistent with the subjective assessments of the study participants.\n\nIDK about you, but I take these supplements anyway. However, most people don't consider collagen or even gelatin, so this post is about it.\n\nGelatin is the same amino acids as in collagen, cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin\n\n>    The amino acid content of hydrolyzed collagen is the same as collagen. Hydrolyzed collagen contains 19 amino acids, predominantly glycine (Gly) 26-34%, proline (Pro) 10-18%, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) 7-15%, which together represent around 50% of the total amino acid content.[11] Glycine is responsible for close packing of the chains. Presence of proline restricts the conformation. This is important for gelation properties of gelatin.[12] Other amino acids that contribute highly include: alanine (Ala) 8-11%; arginine (Arg) 8-9%; aspartic acid (Asp) 6-7%; and glutamic acid (Glu) 10-12%.[11]\n\n# But why gelatin? Why not collagen gummies?\n\nFirst, it absorbs better. It's been studied and proved not just to increase blood levels, but to be included in the skin 2x as much as the separate amino acids: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183725/\n\n> Mouse studies that used 14C-labeled gelatin hydrolysate (33) further demonstrated that, although tracer from proline could be incorporated into skin collagen at the same rate as tracer from gelatin, tracer from the gelatin was incorporated into the collagen of cartilage and muscle twice as much as tracer from proline \n\nSecond, it's cheaper - way cheaper, and safer that supplements: you can have it twice a day if you don't do OMAD, in larger amounts, and not just glycine or proline, but 4 amino acids:\n\n> Here, we show that after ingestion of gelatin in humans, glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine peak in the blood after 1 h\n\nAlso, even if supplements company may do some tests, I'm sure Kroger (and the FDA) takes the quality of the gelatin they sell in supermarket even more seriously than ShadyCompany that sells on Amazon.\n\nThird, eating jello is fun! If you make flavored jello (no need for sugar if you use rose water and/or orange blossom water from your local indian supermarket), you can eat a fun food instead of swallowing pills - same reason why I prefer Kimchi or Natto to vitamin K pills. I've included a few recipes below.\n\nFourth, it's easy to make and you can add stuff to it, like vitamin C or the other supplement powders you take. I prefer to take my vit C separately as I'm afraid the heat would have a bad effect.\n\nFinally, it's super fast: Once I'm done eating my jello, it takes me 1 min to boil water in the microwave, add gelatin powder, the orange blossom water, then put the container in the fridge so that it's ready next time I need it. That's nothing compared to meal prep.\n\n# Dose and timing jelly with exercice\n\nIf you some form of exercice, consider eating gelatin 1h before: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183725/\n\n> Supplementation with increasing amounts of gelatin increased circulating glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine, peaking 1 h after the supplement was given. Engineered ligaments treated for 6 d with serum from samples collected before or 1 h after subjects consumed a placebo or 5 or 15 g gelatin showed increased collagen content and improved mechanics. Subjects who took 15 g gelatin 1 h before exercise showed double the amino-terminal propeptide of collagen I in their blood, indicating increased collagen synthesis.\n\n15g is like 3 doses of the gelatin I get at my local supermarket. It takes about one bowl of water. I prefer to take the vitamin C separately, but at the same time.\n\n# Possible recipes\n\nIf you're not as much of a health freak as I try to be, and want to make gelatin very fun, there are many recipes:\n\nMatcha jelly:\nhttps://kirbiecravings.com/matcha-jelly/\n\nCoffee jelly:\nhttp://julesfood.blogspot.com/2013/06/vietnamese-coffee-jelly-desserteasy.html\n\nJuice flavored:\nhttps://www.food.com/recipe/fruit-juice-knox-blox-196761#activity-feed\n\nYou can also do savory recipes with bone broth jelly. Gelatin is fun (and wiggly)\n\n# Limits\n\nIt won't do if you are vegan: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gelatin-source/\n\n> JELL-O is made from gelatin, an animal product rendered from the hides and bones of animals, typically pork skins, pork, horses, cattle bones, and split cattle hides.\" per Snopes.\n\nAs gelatin is made from leftover parts, it's unlikely to be why animals are butchered. So I don't feel bad about that.\n\nAnd when I feel bad about meat, I try to remember these funny 3 rules in life:\n\n1) if it's alive, kill it\n\n2) if it's dead, cook it\n\n3) rinse and repeat if it was yummy!\n\nI hope it was informative, and it may cause you to start adding gelatin to your meals!",

I just take a small drink of water and dry shot the powder all at once in my mouth and swallow. Hope this makes sense how I'm explaining. Does anyone know if doing this makes a difference on the effectiveness? I just do it this way because it's quicker and easier. Also, thanks for this post, I make bone broth now and am probably going to look into buying just basic gelatine mix, its definately super cost effective!",

While many people do apply tretinoin around their eyes, this can cause permanent damage to the oil glands in the eyes, and can result in permanently dry eyes. Remember that tretinoin travels up to 2\" below the skin, so you'll still get anti-aging benefits even if you don't apply right next to your eyes. Be safe, and protect your eyes: don't apply tretinoin near your eyes or on your eyelids. [Here's what the Mayo Clinic has to say about safe tretinoin application.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/tretinoin-topical-route/proper-use/drg-20066521#:~:text=Do%20not%20use%20this%20medicine,the%20tips%20of%20your%20fingers) (To learn more, search for \"Meibomian gland dysfunction\")\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body": "**What motivated this review:**\n\nI grew up in an area with access to natural hot springs.  I used to go for soaks in the geothermal pools quite often and it was (and still is) one of my favorite things to do.  I now live quite far away from where I grew up and sadly there aren't any hot springs within driving distance. Feeling a bit homesick this past winter, I tried out a bunch of Japanese hot springs powders and thought you guys might be interested in some reviews.\n\n\n[Album of the products reviewed.](http://imgur.com/a/B4wC5)\n\n[Bonus cat pic](http://imgur.com/bA5dtMf)\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy White**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/5ZXT7Ri)\n\n- I purchased this on Amazon Prime (~$18 for 680g tin).\n\n**Claims:** (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n>  Contains Angelicae Radix Extract that increases blood circulation and relieves aches and fatigue\n>  Contains Dried Puerariae Radix Extract that increases skin vitality\n>  Helps to ease rheumatism, cold constitution and relieving fatigue\n> Transforms bathwater into milky white color with a calming citrus floral fragrance\n\n**Ingredients:**  \n- Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, Japanese angelica root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, fragrance.\n\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This was my favorite out of all of the bath powders I tried.  Lovely scent and very relaxing bathing experience! I've seen it described in marketing materials as \"fresh citrus floral bouquet\" but it doesn't smell how I'd imagine based on description alone. There are notes of citrus, but they are subtle. Stronger when you smell it in the tin, and seem to fade once the powder is dissolved in the bathwater.  The floral fragrance is similar to what I think of as hanbang: musky and herbal. Not sickly sweet. Neither feminine nor masculine.  There are notes of rose, but not like Mamonde rose, more like musky rose incense.  The scent is strong but IMO not overpowering. A little bit goes a long way.\n\n\n- RE the claims, adding this to the bathwater does seem to make the heat hold longer and it does soothe minor muscle aches and pains.  However, it definitely does not cure fatigue, as I'm usually so relaxed by the end of it that I'm ready to fall asleep in the bath.  I'm also skeptical of the claims about skin vitality.  It does make my skin feel silky, but beyond that the benefits to skin seem pretty negligible.\n\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy Blue**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/s8nXU5q) \n\n- Purchased on Amazon Prime (~$18 for 680g tin)\n\n**Claims:**  (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> [H]ot spring mineral (sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen sulfate) and herbal medicines (angelica extract) can work to the core of the body to enhance the warm bath effect, stiff shoulders medicated bath agent that is effective in low back pain, neuralgia. In warm coat of assimilated active ingredients, hot spring mineral turbidity hot water to enhance the warm bath effect prevents Yuzame. Protein and hot springs mineral of the surface of the skin to create a thin film on the entire body, in order to prevent the dissipation of heat, thermal effect will persist. In addition, herbal ingredients, angelica extract (active ingredient) is, to enhance the warm bath effect, warm the body from the core. To promote blood circulation, it is also effective in recovery from fatigue because loosen the body.\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- dried sodium sulfate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, Toukiekisu distributed, oxidation Ti, POE (300) POP (55), perfume, silicic acid anhydride, stearoylglutamic acid Na, anhydrous pyrophosphate Na, salicylic acid, bentonite, glycine, Jiouekisu, BG, blue No. 1\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This smells strongly of artificial fruit in the tin. At first whiff, it reminded me of Sweet Tarts candy.  A reviewer on Amazon compared it to Pez with a hint of flowers, which I think is pretty accurate.  It mellows out quite a bit once it's in the water.  The fragrance is not as strong as some of the other varieties.  The powder is a dark blue right out of the tin.  True to its description, it makes the bathwater a cloudy blue color.  \n\n- RE the claims, adding this to the bathwater does seem to make the heat hold longer.  I am skeptical about the claim that it forms a film that keeps your body temperature warm after leaving the bath.  I didn't notice any real difference compared to the warmth I feel after taking a regular old bath.  I am not sure what “Yuzame” means or why I'd want to prevent it, but the claim about relaxing muscles is definitely true, IMO.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy Green**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/Ro6TWEM)\n\n- Purchased on Amazon Prime (~$24 for 680g tin)\n\n**Claims:**  (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> About 90% of hot spring mineral and herbal component of all the components. Enhance the warm bath effect in warm coat of turbidity hot water, to prevent Yuzame. Effective, such as fatigue, shoulder rest, low back pain, neuralgia, poor circulation, arthritis, heat rash, eczema, roughening resistance.\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- The scent is herbal, floral and slightly fruity. There are notes of passionfruit and citrus. Right out of the tin, the product is dark green.  It turns the bathwater into a beautiful cloudy bright green color.  \n\n- RE the claims, I can't speak to the parts about “neuralgia, poor circulation, arthritis, heat rash, eczema” and not sure what “roughening resistance” even means, but this one is just as good at relaxing tired muscles as the blue and white varieties.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Japanese Cypress (Hinoki) **  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/rdj2I3t)\n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n \n**Claims:**   (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> [A] medicinal bath salt series with natural essences, relaxing. Ion veil wraps the whole body, retains its warm after bathing, bath effect. Stiff neck, back pain, poor circulation, fatigue effects.\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n- sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate, thehalose hinokitol, fragrance, D&C Yellow no. 8, polyoxyproplene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- Straight out of the tin, this stuff is orange in color and smells strongly of earthy pine with a hint of smoky campfire.  A more masculine scent overall.  Once it's in the bathwater, it mellows out but the pine notes stick around.  It turns the bathwater a cloudy orangy white color.  The effect of this one is similar to the Muddy varieties reviewed above.\n\n**Bath Roman Milk Protein**  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/q8yX8k8) \n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n\n**Claims:**  (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n> Milk protein penetrates into dry skin cells, replenishing your skin's moisture level.\n> Soaking with Japanese bath powder keeps severely dry skin moisturized and nourished.\n\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- sodium bicarbonate, sodium caseinate, fragrance, parabens, polyoxypropylene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This smells like sweetened condensed milk, but not in a bad way.  It’s a lovely sweet steamed milk and slightly floral, slightly baby powder scent, more feminine than some of the others.  It reminds me of Etude House Milk Talk body wash with a bit less baby powder and a bit more milk.  It didn’t seem that strong to me, but my husband came home while I was in the bath and he could smell it when he walked into the house (which is saying something because our bathtub is on another floor). True to the description, this does turn the water a milky white color.  It made my skin feel silky smooth, but I am skeptical about the claims about nourishing dry skin.  My skin certainly didn't feel dry afterward, but it wasn't incredibly moisturized, either.  My skin is naturally on the oily side, so someone with dry skin would probably not find it very moisturizing at all.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Ceramide**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/vHSKQ2t)\n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n\n**Claims:**  (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n> Contains Ceramides that replenish and retain moisture in the skin.\n> Helps eczema, acne, heat rash and other skin irritations.\n> Leaves skin smooth and moisturized after bathing.\n> Soaking with Japanese bath salts relaxes, moisturizes and polishes rough skin.\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- Sodium bicarbonate, sodium caseinate, fragrance, parabens, polyoxypropylene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This has a bright, fresh lilac and clean linen scent.  It turned the bathwater a milky white color.  It made my skin feel soft and moisturized, but was not emollient.\n\n- Consistent with my review of the Milk variety, I am skeptical about the claims about moisturizing dry skin.  My skin certainly didn't feel dry afterward, but it wasn't incredibly moisturized, either.  My skin is naturally on the oily side, so someone with dry skin would probably not find it very moisturizing at all. I am lucky to have pretty tolerant skin that's not prone to irritation, so I can't speak to the claims about healing eczema, acne, heat rash and other skin irritations.\n\n**Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe (Uruoi)**  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/bJlMZzN)\n\n- Purchased from Japanese grocery store (~$8 for 600g), but you can buy it on Amazon for ~$12 shipped (not Prime)\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon)\n\n> Increase blood circulation and warm your core. Emerge renewed.\n \n**Ingredients:** \n\n- Sodium sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium glutamate, fragrance, silica, PEG-75 stearate, cellulose gum, sodium polyacrylate, sekken soji, polyacrylic acid, bentonite, water, butylene glycol, methicone, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, pvp, aloe yohjyu matsu ekisu, sodium hyaluronate.\n\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This was my least favorite of all the bath powders I tried, largely because of the scent.  It’s like a combination of artificial cucumber, lime, Pine Sol and Degree men's deodorant.   That said, it was the most moisturizing and emollient of all the bath powders I tried.  RE the claim about increasing blood circulation and warm[ing] the core,” my hunch is that it's mostly the hot bath water that is responsible for this, rather than the powder itself.\n\n\n**Bathclin Pure Skin**  \n[Pic](http://imgur.com/An3xsiP)\n\n- Purchased from a Japanese grocery store (~$8 for 600g), but you can buy it on Amazon Prime for ~$13\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon - same as Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe)\n\n> Increase blood circulation and warm your core. Emerge renewed.   \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n- Sodium sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium glutamate, fragrance, PEG-75 stearate, cellulose gum, silica, sodium polyacrylate, sekken soji, polyacrylic acid, bentonite, methicone, hydrolyzed collagen, water, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, pvp, glycine soja (soybean) seed extract.\n\n\n**Review:** \n\n- After trying and disliking the scent of Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe, I admit that I was not super eager to try this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Like the Bath Roman muddy white, this is marketed as having a “citrus floral” scent.  However, this one actually does have a strong citrus fragrance.  It smells strongly of grapefruit, which to me is heavenly.  There's a hint of Lemon Pledge fragrance, but I don't find it bothersome.\n\n- It could be my imagination, but I swear there is a slight effervescent effect right after the powder goes into the bathwater.  It turned the bathwater a milky white color.  It made my skin feel silky smooth but was not nearly as moisturizing as Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe.  RE the claim about increasing blood circulation and warm[ing] the core,” my hunch is that it's mostly the hot bath water that is responsible for this, rather than the powder.\n\n**Tabino Yado Hot Springs: Milky and Clear varieties**\n\n[Pic of the Clear varieties] (http://imgur.com/QBo58U1) (unfortunately I accidentally got rid of the box for the Milky varieties :-/)\n\n- I purchased these on Amazon Prime (~$23 for 28 packets), but you can also buy boxes of Milky (13 packets, 25g each) and Clear (15 packets, 25g each) separately for around $12 each.\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon)\n\n- Each of the 9 different varieties is supposed to represent a famous Japanese [onsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen).\n\n- According to the product description:\n> [n]ot a perfume or bubble bath - Minerals promote circulation and warmth... Intense aromas relax you and last as long as your bath!\n\n**Ingredients for Milky varieties:**\n\n- [KIRISHIMA] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, fragrance, silica, aconus calamus root extract, aloe arborescens leaf extract, dipropylene glycol, alcohol, water, FD&C red no.28, FD&C yellow blue no.1 \n\n- [OKUHIDA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminim silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [SHIRAHONE] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium glutamate, calcium carbonate, kaolin, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, potassium chloride, silica, cellulose gum, fragrance, ci no.59040 pyranine conc, ci no.73015 indigo carmine, \n\n- [TOWADA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminim silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090).\n\n\n**Ingredients for Clear varieties:**\n\n- [BEPPU] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, fragrance, silica, aconus calamus root extract, aloe arborescens leaf extract, dipropylene glycol, alcohol, water, FD&C red no.28, FD&C yellow blue no.1 \n\n- [SHIRAHAMA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminum silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [HAKONE] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium glutamate, calcium carbonate, kaolin, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, potassium chloride, silica, cellulose gum, fragrance, ci no.59040 pyranine conc, ci no.73015 indigo carmine, \n\n- [KUSATSU] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminum silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [NOBORIBETSU] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, dextrin, calcium carbonate, silica, potassium chloride, fragrance.\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- These come in small packets.  The packets are color coded but there is no English labeling so it was hard for me to judge the individual varieties.  TBH, all 9 varieties (4 milky, 5 clear) seem very similar to one another in terms of scent.  Many of them smelled fruity, similar to the Pez candy smell of the Bath Roman Muddy Blue. The only real differences I could observe were the obvious ones: the color and whether the water looked milky or clear.  The results really didn’t seem to differ all that much.   They all smell pleasant and do a nice job relaxing sore muscles.\n\n\n**TL;DR** \n\n- The first one I tried was Bath Roman Muddy White, and it got me hooked!   The Bath Roman Muddy and Hinoki varieties were my favorites overall.  They all made my skin silky smooth, relaxed my tired muscles and seem to hold the heat of the bath water longer.  My favorite is still the Muddy White because I adore the scent.\n\n- Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe was my least favorite of all of them because of its scent.  \n\n- All of them made for a relaxing bath experience, which is really all that I expect out of this type of product.  Unfortunately, hot springs powders are no substitute for the real thing.  That said, these are still fantastic products for soothing sore muscles and stress relief!\n\nEdited formatting & added bonus cat pic",

    "body": "Yall, I get sad when I see some of these hopeless posts. It’s important to empower ourselves, not beat ourselves down. I really hate my scars (no duh. lol!) but I also begrudgingly accept that they have made me a stronger person. \n\nSome pearls of wisdom I would like to share, most based on my own research & I do hope others contribute to this thread by sharing their own pearls with the community! Sharing is caring \n\n1. If the UV index is above* 0, you should wear a hat: Not only do hats greatly diminish the appearance of your scars but it also protects your hair, scalp and skin. Plus UV exposure is horrible for your hair (tons of research on this)\n\n2. Even if the UV index is 0, you should be using SPF. Tinted SPF has been shown to be more effective versus untinted SPF. I use elta MD spf, their products have so many bomb ingredients  lol.  If you suffer from PIH, not applying SPF can make your PIH worse. \n\n3. Get on a prescription retinol and use it every night. Aklief is the newest generation, so if you have the budget, I’d recommend it. \n\n4. Consume vitamin C daily in your diet & apply vitamin C topically in the AM. Most research studies on oral vitamin c and skin health have used 500-1000mg oral consumption of vitamin c daily (yes this is higher than the RDA). Not only does vit C prevent collagen breakdown (lots of high quality research on this) but topical vitamin C also has been shown in some studies to complement acne scarring treatments like laser. Ideally, you want to be consuming vit c orally and applying vit c topically in the AM. Good sources: citrus, berries, green veggies! Can consider a supplement too. I knew a model with glowing amazing skin, she swore by a very high dose of oral vitamin c daily (higher than the daily upper limit which is 2000mg - do not recommend - but I found that to be interesting)\n\nIf you wish to supplement, consider L-Ascorbic Acid or Ester-C. \n\nL-Ascorbic acid: most active form of vitamin C + super effective in collagen synthesis + antioxidant functions. It’s the most researched form for skin health.\n\nEster-C (Calcium Ascorbate): less acidic, good option if you have digestive sensitivity. It's more bioavailable & stays in the body longer than L-Ascorbic.\n\n5. Boost blood circulation to your face: exercise & facial massage. Exercise, specifically heavy weight lifting, has been shown to stimulate fibroblast cells & collagen production. Facial massage has also been shown to stimulate collagen. \n\n6. Be kind to your mind. Positive self talk is the best way to cope effectively and therefore do something productive about your acne scarring. \n\n7. Practice daily Graditudes. The best thing I did for myself was taking the time to write down the things I’m grateful for everyday. I think it’s so easy to focus on the negative, and it doesn’t really attract more abundance into our lives. Just having access to clean water, not living in chronic pain, these are things that should be celebrated. A TON of research on gratitude and physical health. Practicing daily graditude will make #6 happen a lot more naturally. It won’t happen overnight, but if you do it consistently for a month, you’ll notice a huge difference in the way you see the world. \n\n8. Challenge yourself and do hard things. It will develop your self confidence and also keep your mind off your scarring.\n\n9. Keep processed sugar, alcohol, smoking to a minimum. All have been shown to degrade collagen and accelerate aging. \n\n10. Please do your own research on acne scars and the skin. I’m talking scholarly material.  You will empower yourself with knowledge and providers will be less likely to take advantage of you. \n\n11. Consider consuming hydrolyzed collagen. I was skeptical but there’s enough research that has made me a believer. Though keep in mind collagen supplements should not substitute any other items on this list.  \n\n12. Consider red light therapy. I personally don’t think it  will help with your scars but red light therapy has been shown to increase the production of collagen and improve skin tone \n\n13. Prioritize sleep!! Inefficient or poor sleep is linked to impaired skin quality \n\n14. Also prioritize hydration :)  not drinking enough water will make your skin dehydrated and it will affect how you feel and your overall appearance \n\n15. When you wash your face, spend at least 60 seconds lathering your face with your cleanser. Another game changer for me. I noticed actives (like retinol) absorb so much better when I did this. \n\n16. I only wash my face at night based on following some Derms etc not sure if there’s research on this 😂\n\n17. Do kind things for others. When we focus on others, again, we are focusing less on ourselves and our woes. Plus it just feels good. \n\n18. Also embrace humour. I’ve learned to see things a lot less seriously and it has helped tremendously at times! \n\n19. Consider experimenting with your diet. Over 80% of the world is lactose intolerant (including me, whee!). If you’re European, you’re likely in the 20%. But for the 80% who are lactose intolerant, not only will consuming dairy give you acne/skin troubles, it will also make you just feel crappy because you’re introducing inflammation in your body by consuming something your body literally cannot process. Oh how I wish I stopped consuming dairy when I was dealing with all that cystic acne. I just loved cheese and ice cream too much LOL. Not only is eating inflammatory foods crap for your physiology but I honestly think it will affect mental too with brain fog/feeling ick etc \n\n20. Introduce fermented foods in your daily diet (kimchi, tempeh, kombucha, etc!). Fermented food have been shown to brighten skin tone and contain strands of prebiotic bacteria that prevent collagen breakdown\n\n21. Never buy a package of treatments from a provider, always purchase a single treatment at a time. Providers have a lot less incentive to provide you results if you’re paying upfront for several sessions. Let them earn your hard earned money. ❤️\n\n22. Listen to uplifting music and positive psychology related podcasts. Upbeat music has been shown to positively affect your mood :)  \n\n23. Keep your actives in a fridge (vitamin c, retinol, etc)! Keeping your topical vitamin c in the fridge will keep it stabilized, keeping your retinol in the fridge will maintain potency :) \n\n24. Consider aha/bha masks 1-2x a week (I have started doing this v recently). Aha/bha masks can improve skin texture over time and help reduce signs of skin aging. \n\n25. If you live in USA or Canada (Idk about other continents), the supplement industry is HIGHLY unregulated. I recommend choosing a supplement brand with 3rd party testing for your oral supplements. \n\n26. Consider an omega 3 supplement. Omega 3 has been shown to reduce acne, slow skin aging,  improve skin hydration and even reduce the skins sensitivity to UV radiation \n\nPS I made a telegram group if anyone would like to join, especially those who have been doing treatments (where yall at?). It’s not a space to be negative but a space for camaraderie, hope and sharing knowledge 🌈\n\nPPS some of these won’t be appropriate for some. We are all so different. Again these are pearls I’ve picked up through my journey :) do I do these things religiously? Some  yes, some no. But creating this list has definitely motivated me to try to be more consistent with things like my omegas & vit c. We’re only human 😁\n\nEdit: I edited this post to remove specific brand suggestions because I don’t want to sway anyone any which way.",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

Climate: hot and humid (SC, USA).\n\n**Product info:** Japanese, SPF 50+ PA+++, free of alcohol, fragrance, essential oils, and niacinamide. Truly a milky texture. Combination sunscreen (meaning both mineral and chemical filters).\n\n**Ingredient list:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BG, Diethylhexyl Succinate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Hydrated Silica, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Lauroyl Lysine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Triethoxysilylethyl Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Hexyl Dimethicone, Methylparaben, EDTA-2Na, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Arginine, Bis-Ethylhexyl Hydroxydimethoxy Benzylmalonate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Acrylates Copolymer, CI 73360, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Talc, Ethanol, Iron Oxides, Tin Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tocopherol, Mica \n\n**My experience with it:** This is the best SPF I've ever tried! I've tried quite a few in my search of the perfect SPF, and nothing has been able to beat this. No white cast on me. I've never experienced pilling or any sort of irritation from it. It wears beautifully under makeup. Easy to blend as it is a truly milky texture. This is truly fragrance free - smells like nothing to me. Natural finish on me but I've read some people have a matte finish with it. I have used this since January of this year (2023). \n\n**Potential con:** I've read some people anecdotally notice getting sun with this product. I haven't noticed this, but I honestly avoid the sun as much as possible. I'd love to hear from those who experience this!\n\n**A true con:** the wimpy size of the bottle. 40 mL is so small! Alas, I'll continue to repurchase. The price is affordable for me (\\~$11 a bottle).\n\n**Another SPF I also love:** Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF 50+ PA++++.",

I recommend giving a listen. She also covers many Asian products both chemical, mineral & hybrid. She also puts links( to sites and stores and is not compensated).

All dietary collagen is, is an incomplete protein with a protein quality score of 0 made from what was previously considered animal processing waste products. What this means is it basically has very few essential amino acids which are the amino acids that the body cannot make on it's own. Collagen supplements are broken down into amino acids in the stomach, just like every other protein, they are not even being directly utilized as collagen. ALL the benefits one might get from consuming collagen would be reached or improved by simply consuming a complete protein like whey or casein. If you are absolutely convinced of a collagen exclusive placebo, you can get the same profile from consuming pork rinds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[More info from Harvard](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/collagen/#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20lack%20of,the%20body%20most%20needs%20protein.)\n\nTldr: You're better off eating quality protein, ideally from meat or dairy.",

        "body": "Wanted to share some info on collagen after reading the comments: \n\nCollagen is the most abundant protein in our bodies. So far, we have discovered 28 types. After your mid-twenties (more or less), you lose about 1% each calendar year. \n\nWe can not increase collagen in our bodies through surface application because the molecule is too big. So, all those expensive creams containing collagen are, unfortunately, not going to penetrate the deeper layers of skin. The product will sit on the surface and make it temporarily smoother, but it will not remodel the underlying structure because it can not reach those depths. \n\nSupplementing with collagen peptides is the only way to increase collagen in the body. The collagen must be hydrolyzed so it can be reabsorbed, which is why you'll see \"hydrolyzed collagen\" or \"collagen peptides\" on the label of pills and powders. Typically, the product will include types 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or some combination. I use a brand from a local store that has all 5 types so that I'm helping every part of my body from joints, tendons, muscles, skin, hair, bones, eyes, and so on. These 5 main types are what most manufacturers include in the product, but some will make a product with only types 1, 2, and 3. You'll see the label and know which ones you're getting. \n\nIn addition, it's important to keep as much of your collagen as you can. Smoking damages the structure of collagen, as well as UV light and sugar. Sugar and lots of refined carbohydrates (such as ultra processed foods) weaken and damage collagen and elastin in the dermis (the deeper layers of skin), leading to wrinkles, sagging, and overall loss of plumpness. \n\nPersonally, I've noticed a huge difference in my hair, skin, and flexibility after a couple of months taking collagen peptides with all 5 main types. The cellulite and loss of firmness in my legs improved a lot, and there's even a little more volume in my face, such as the temples. It's not comparable to dermal fillers or Botox, but it's a noticeable difference in smoothness and elasticity. I hope this helps. As always, speak with your doctor if you have questions as this is not meant to be medical advice. \n\nSources: Cleveland Clinic, collagen; Paula's Choice on collagen; Dr Brad Stanfield on collagen supplements on YouTube.",

(Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them.

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "[Manyo Factory Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Repair Skin Toner](http://manyo-factory.com/en/shop/product/hyaluronic-acid-hydrating-repair-skin-toner)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI purchased this toner about a month ago. I know only a month's use is a bit premature, and I usually do reviews of products once I have completely finished them,  but if I wait until I finish this product it will probably be 5-6 months from now.\n\n**Feel**\n\nThis toner feels really nice on the skin. It is a bit thicker than water and is totally clear. I pour a small puddle into my hand, and then pat into my skin. I apply it after using a facial spray (Caudalie Grape Water or Manyo Factory Lactobacillus Mist). I bring it up under my eyes without irritation. I even apply it to my lips.\n\n**Results**\n\nSo for skin care products that aren't actives, I sometimes feel like I don't notice any difference in my skin, and I have to wonder if it's doing anything at all. I was beginning to feel the same way about this product, but then I forgot to apply it the other day before going to work, and my skin had a slight tight feeling all day. I was definitely missing some hydration. This toner definitely hydrates my skin well, and when applied to my lips makes them plumper. I really enjoy using this, and I might even like it better than the Pyunkang Yul Essence toner that I always recommend to people looking for a hydrating toner.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nI'll include the entire ingredients list so you can see all the awesome stuff in it. I was really impressed with the ingredients list.\n\n Mineral Water, Carbonated Water, Hydrolyzed Collagen Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Sodium PCA, Urea, Uric Acid, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Magnesium Chloride, Ceramide NP, Oligopeptide-29, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Arbutin, Butylene Glycol, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Water, Methylpropanediol, Chondrus Crispus Powder, Caprylyl Glycol, Glutamic acid, Threonine, Serine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Lactic acid, Citric Acid, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Valine, Isoleucine,Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Cysteine, Xanthan Gum, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Aspartic acid \n\nYou've got ceramides, collagen, glycerin, arbutin, allantoin, urea, panthenol, amino acids, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, and plant extracts. It's a win in my book. I would bet this could help repair a damaged moisture barrier (the name says as much anyway)\n\n**Packaging**\n\nIt comes in a 250 mL bottle with a flip cap. I haven't experienced any issues with pouring out too much. I think the packaging is great, and would probably be good for traveling (obviously not on an airplane because it's too big for the liquid regulations)\n\n**Repurchase?**\n\nAbsolutely! My mom is using it too, and we both love it. It definitely makes a difference in my skin and leaves it feeling hydrated. I would recommend this to anyone needing a hydrating toner. It also layers well if you wanted to do the 7 skin method with it. I haven't done 7 layers, but have done 2 or 3 without issue. It also works well when I use it alongside the Pyunkang Yul Essence toner.",

    "body": "Happy to share my success story! I'm down over 92lbs since starting in July 2022. SW 267 CW 175 5'3.\n\nWhen I started, I did 4 weeks on 0.25 and then moved to 0.50. I've only ever injected in my upper thigh and only experienced side effects the first week. I was tired and projectile vomited at work once (while just having started a new job, lol). Nothing besides that, other than the occasional fatigue.\n\nThese last two weeks I've wanted to make an extra push since I hit a bit of a plateau, so I started injecting in my stomach. Imo it's a lot more effective at curbing appetite (I inject on Monday, but start getting more hungry again around Saturday evenings when I inject in my thigh), but it makes me more nauseous as well.\n\nI never exercised until 4 months ago, because honestly I was too overweight to comfortably work out. Everything sucked and everything hurt. I needed to get to a healthier weight (for me, around 210lbs) to even want to try consistently. I started working out on the elliptical every day, even if it was slow at a high incline. I also started walking for 30min+ every day. This is something I've grown to love and now never want to give up again.\n\nI love how I can move my body now, what it can do, how mobile I feel and how easy life is. I love clothes shopping and EVERYTHING fits. I went from a size 20 (close to 22) in jeans to a size 10! I have regained so much confidence, it's insane. At my highest weight, I didn't want to make eye contact with myself in the mirror anymore. But now, I love being in pictures, love taking pictures of myself, don't hide in the house anymore and I truly feel like I have my life back.\n\nOne downside is loose skin unfortunately. I don't have much yet, but my goal weight is around 120 (unsure if possible, we'll see). I've been taking hydrolyzed collagen, iron, biotin and fiber supplements. Not sure if that's made a difference but I think it can't hurt.\n\nI've learned a lot about my body and I love that knowledge. I know what my body needs when I work out. I know how to fuel it without overeating. I make way better choices while eating out. I eat clean pretty much every day now, but I don't deny myself anything I want. Just in smaller quantities.\n\nIf you have any questions, ask away!",

Photos 5 and 6 are from an Orang County, CA TJ Maxx. Stores are clean and organized.\n\nHAUL and mini review: (dry/dehydrating/30/Socal)\n\n**Laneige cica sleeping mask $20 60 mL**. My ride or die cica cream that I always need to have in stock. I ran out in March and was gonna buy more on my Japan trip, but couldnt find it in Japan. I didnt really wanna deal with the shipping and tariffs mess with online retailers so I intended to buy it whenever theres a sale at my local Amorepacific/Aritaum store. Regular price is $34, I was hoping to snag it on a 30% sale for \\~ $25, but TJ Maxx selling it for $20 is fantastic. Even Stylevana only has it on sale for $24 right now. I was devastated that this TJ only has 1 in stock. \n\nMini review: Nothing soothes my skin the way this cica cream does it, especially on hotter days. Its my fall back whenever my skin acts up. 10/10. Have been repurchasing for 5 years I think.\n\nIngredients: Water, Propanediol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Squalane, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Glycerin, Panthenol, Cetearylalcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, 1,2-hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Hydroxyethylacrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Tauratecopolymer, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Sorbitan Isostearate, Asiatic Acid, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**Parnell  cicamanu cotton clear pad $5 90 pads.** This was a clearance item. I didnt even know Parnell sells skincare. I thought they're a makeup company that focuses on cushions. Just checked Stylevana, its being sold for $18.\n\nIngredients: Water, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, C12-14 Pareth-12, Glycereth-26, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glyceryl Caprylate, Betaine, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Leptospermum Scoparium Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Honey Extract, Gluconolactone, Ceramide NP, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Madecassoside, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream $25 30mL + 50mL**. Have not tried. The Dr. Jart cica cream is a thin gel that was too thin for my dry skin so Im hoping this ceramidin cream is thicker.

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna. Okay, enuff intro.

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "Skin type: 30. Dehydrated. Dry. Sensitive to external factors.\n\n**1. Muji brightening moisturizing milk spf 41 PA+++**. Previously reviewed in a prior post about trying Muji travel size skincare. Milky texture. Its drying and smells like citrus due to the essential oil. WNR. Feels drying on my skin. Maybe someone with oily skin would like it more.\n\nIngredients: Water, 1, 3-propanediol, fine titanium oxide, talc, dimethicone, concentrated glycerin, sugar squalane, 2-pentanediol, lipophilic glyceryl stearate, behenyl alcohol, PEG stearate, POE (20) sorbitan oleate, PEG (80), lavender extract-1, chamomilla extract-1, calendula officinalis extract, tangerine peel extract, kiwi extract, oleoyl phytosphingosine, alanine, Arginine, sodium L-glutamate, serine, proline, sodium hyaluronate-2, dipentaerythrityl hexaoxystearate, POP methyl glucoside, BG, ethylhexyl glycerin, beeswax, polyhydroxystearic acid, isostearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, hydrated silicic acid, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, starch-sodium acrylate graft polymer, sodium alginate, citric acid, sodium citrate, natural vitamin E, fragrance\n\n**2. Rohto Mentholatum - Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect Gel.** Travel size that I got at a random convenience store while in Japan. Soft gel-like texture. Good in humid weather. Not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Its a decent moisturizer for me in the daytime in the summer. WNR. Again, maybe someone with oily skin may benefit more from this gel.\n\nIngreditents: Water, BG, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, pentylene glycol, PPG-10 methyl glucose, triethyl hexanoin, squalane, (acryloyl dimethyl taurine ammonium / VP) copolymer, behenyl alcohol, acetyl hyaluronic acid Na (super hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid Na, hydrolysed hyaluronic acid (nano-ized hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid hydroxypropyl trimonium (skin-adsorbed hyaluronic acid), hydrolyzed collagen, glucosylceramide (ceramide), suizenzino-polysaccharide (Sakuran), dimethicone, PPG-17 butes -17, triethyl citrate, cyclopentasiloxane, phenoxyethanol, succinic acid 2Na, dimethicone crosspolymer, agarten, EDTA-2Na, succinic acid, α-glucan, acrylate copolymer ammonium , Methyl paraben\n\n**3. Kansosan Medical Highly Moisturizing Cream.** A buttery and moisturizing cream. While shopping at Donki, I googled what is the best Japanese cream for dry and sensitive skin and Kansosan was suggested so I bought it to try. \n\nIts fantastic on my dry skin. It sinks in upon application but also coats my skin with a layer of moisturizing protection. Ive been using it for 2 days now and all I can think about is how amazing this would be for winters. Im gonna stock up when I go back to Japan. I think I found my holy grail moisturizer. I need to try other products from this brand. \n\nThis cream is like the better formulated version of the Kikumasamune sake cream and the Purito Dermide sleeping pack. Plus Kansosan doesnt smell bad. People who enjoy thick moisturizers like the Illiyoon and Aestura would like this cream.\n\nIngredients: Heparin-like substance\\*, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate\\*, Purified Water, Glycerin, Methylphenyl Polysiloxane, Cross-linked Methyl Polysiloxane, Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, 1,3-Butanediol, Methyl Polysiloxane, Polyethylene Glycol-Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, 2-Ethylhexyl Dodecanol, 1,2-Pentanediol, Poly(Oxyethylene-Oxypropylene) Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, Isostearic Acid Hardened Oil, Anhydrous Magnesium Sulfate, α-Olefin Oligomer, Sodium Citrate, Glycerol Mono-2-Ethylhexyl Ether, Sodium Metabisulfite, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Citric Acid, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Sodium Phosphate, Vaseline, Glycosyl Squalane, L-Arginine, Hydrogenated Soybean Phospholipid, Plant Sterols, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Water Soluble Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Polyethylene Glycol Octyl Dodecyl Ether, Plant Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate (2), \n\n\\*denotes \"Active Ingredient\", no symbol denotes \"Other Ingredients\"  \n",

Ocean warming is threatening the health of coral reefs. Besides coral bleaching, stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD), a disease caused by a coral pathogen, is rampaging in several tropical oceans.   \n>  \n>During their survey, the researchers found that galaxy coral suffers from SCTLD in some regions. They sampled gastric fluids from healthy and unhealthy corals from the South China Sea. Among the fluids, researchers identified the temperature-dependent pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus. When infected with this pathogen, galaxy colonies showed serious tissue loss under acute heat stress, confirming that Vibrio coralliilyticus is a causative agent of SCTLD in galaxy coral.   \n>  \n>\"Clearly, pathogens have evolved many strategies to evade host defenses to colonize the gastric cavity of wild corals, and the results can now be taken into account for coral reef conservation,\" said Wang.    \n\nFurther Reading: [https://ecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/temperate-phage-trojan-horse-in-coral-holobiont](https://ecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/temperate-phage-trojan-horse-in-coral-holobiont)\n\nStudy: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01795-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01795-y)\n\n**\\[PLASTICS\\]** [**India bans 19 single-use plastic items to combat pollution**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/1/india-bans-19-single-use-plastic-items-to-combat-pollution)\n\n>July 1, 2022 -  India has imposed a ban on single-use plastics on items ranging from  straws to cigarette packets to combat worsening pollution in the nation of nearly 1.4 billion people.  \n>  \n>The ban on single-use plastic items includes straws, cutlery, earbuds, packaging films, plastic sticks for balloons, candy and ice cream, and cigarette packets, among other products, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a statement on Friday.  \n>  \n>Plastic waste has become a significant source of pollution in India, the world’s second-most populous country, and rapid economic growth has fuelled demand for goods that come with single-use plastic products, such as straws and disposable cutlery.   \n>  \n>This is not the first time that India has considered a plastic ban.

But they have exploded across the developing world where they are used to sell everything from laundry detergent to seasoning and snacks to low-income households.  \n>  \n>They have also helped fuel a global waste crisis. Made of layers of plastic and aluminum, sachets are nearly impossible to recycle and aren’t biodegradable. They’re littering neighborhoods, jamming garbage dumps, choking waterways and harming wild creatures. Yet even as Unilever executives have publicly decried the environmental harm done by this packaging, the multinational has worked to undercut laws aimed at eliminating sachets in at least three Asian countries, Reuters has learned.  \n>  \n>In Sri Lanka, the company pressed the government to reconsider a proposed sachet ban, then tried to maneuver around it once regulations were imposed, a senior environmental official told Reuters. In India and the Philippines, Unilever lobbied against proposed sachet bans that were later dropped by lawmakers, sources directly involved said.  \n>  \n>Plastic sachets are especially prevalent in Asian countries that contribute the most to ocean plastic pollution, making them a lightning rod for environmental groups seeking tougher laws on the biggest users of single-use plastic packaging. \n\n# RESEARCH\n\n**\\[FACE MASK\\]** [**Mask relief: Salmon complex moisturiser eases sensitive skin problems caused by face masks**](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2022/07/04/Mask-relief-Salmon-complex-moisturiser-eases-sensitive-skin-problems-caused-by-face-masks)\n\n>July 4, 2022 - Wearing a face mask causes physiological changes in sensitive skin, but applying a salmon complex moisturiser after removing it improved conditions, according to a new study.   \n>  \n>The moisturiser used was KAHI Multi Balm, by KOREATECH Co.

This product contains three types of salmon complex (hydrolyzed collagen, soluble proteoglycan, and sodium DNA) as well as fermented Jeju oil and adenosine to help moisturize the skin and improve wrinkles.  \n>  \n>In a previous study, the group found that using moisturiser while wearing the mask for a long time helps in reducing skin wrinkles and pores.  \n>  \n>In further studies they plan to investigate and compare the use of moisturiser and skin self-recovery in short durations.\n\nStudy: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/srt.13173](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/srt.13173)\n\n>**Materials and methods:** Twenty healthy Korean women with sensitive skin participated in this study. To determine any skin-related changes caused by mask-wearing, we evaluated redness, hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and moisture at 2.5 mm below the surface before and 4 h after wearing a Korea Filter 94 mask. In addition, we tested whether applying a moisturizer for 30 min after mask removal could reverse any mask-induced changes.  \n>  \n>**Results:** Skin redness and TEWL were significantly increased at 4 h after wearing a mask (*p* < 0.05), otherwise skin hydration and the 2.5 mm moisture were significantly decreased (*p* < 0.05). After applying the moisturizer, skin redness and TEWL were significantly decreased compared to their values 4 h after wearing masks  (*p* < 0.05), whereas skin hydration and the 2.5 mm moisture were significantly increased (*p* < 0.05).  Moreover, after applying the moisturizer, skin redness and TEWL were  significantly reduced compared to the pre-masking baseline (*p* < 0.05), whereas skin hydration was significantly increased (*p* < 0.05); the 2.5 mm moisture showed no significant change.\n\n**\\[HYALURONIC ACID\\]** [**Hyaluronic acid-cyclodextrin encapsulating paeonol for treatment of atopic dermatitis**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35714817/)\n\n>June 15, 2022 - The cyclodextrin (CD) was grafted onto hyaluronic acid (HA) to form a topical delivery carrier (HACD) in which Paeonol was loaded in its CD cavity and self-assemble into the polymeric micelles (HACD-PAE) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Fluorescence microscope observed that HACD could fast penetrate into the skin and remain stable within 12 h. In vitro penetration test (IVPT) results showed the PAE retentions of HACD-PAE group in the stratum corneum and dermis were 3.35 and 1.78 times improvement than that of PAE group. ATR-FTIR and H&E staining assays indicated HACD could increase the gap of keratinocytes by interacting with corneum lipids and loosening the keratin. Furthermore, HACD-PAE showed the best therapeutic effect on atopic dermatitis mice. Thus HACD could be a promising skin-specific delivery carrier, not only  promoting the drug penetrating but increasing its remaining in the skin and play the skin disease therapy and skin-care role.      \n\n**\\[INOTODIOL\\]**  [**Antiaging effect of inotodiol on oxidative stress in human dermal fibroblasts**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332222007004?via%3Dihub)\n\n>June 24, 2022 - Oxidative damage is one of the major causes of human skin aging. Inotodiol is a lanostane triterpenoid that demonstrates antiviral, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. Previous studies have reported that inotodiol also has antiallergic effects. However, whether inotodiol inhibits oxidative stress-induced human skin aging is not known. Stimulation of human dermal fibroblast cells with hydrogen peroxide is related to skin aging. Inotodiol inhibited the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NADPH Oxidase 5 (NOX5). Moreover, inotodiol effectively decreased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), as well as nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Based on our results, inotodiol protects human dermal fibroblast by preventing MAPK-NOX5 and NF-κB activation and attenuates the expression of aging genes. Inotodiol may therefore be considered a potential candidate for developing natural antiaging products, because it protects the human skin from oxidative stress-induced skin aging by inhibiting the MAPK-NOX5 and NF-κB signaling pathways.\n\n**\\[MOSQUITO REPELLENT\\]** [**Kao's mosquito repellent for Southeast Asia taps cosmetics tech**](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Kao-s-mosquito-repellent-for-Southeast-Asia-taps-cosmetics-tech)\n\n>June 16, 2022 -  Kao has debuted a mosquito repellent in Thailand by applying technologies used in cosmetics to prompt the insects to fly away as soon as they land on the skin, the Japanese company said Wednesday.  \n>  \n>The new cream is made from low-viscosity silicone oil, commonly used in cosmetics. When a mosquito lands on skin that has the product applied, it senses danger and flees, according to the company. The number of mosquito bites was reduced by 74% in Kao's tests.\n\n[Kao Press Release](https://www.kao.com/global/en/news/business-finance/2022/20220615-001/)\n\nStudy: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468126/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468126/)\n\n>Mosquito legs have a unique highly water-repellent surface structure. While being beneficial to mosquitoes, the water-repellence of the tarsi  enhances the wettability of hydrophobic substances such as oils. This high wettability induces strong attraction forces on a mosquito’s legs  (up to 87% of the mosquito’s weight) towards the oil. We studied the landing behaviour of mosquitoes on oil-coated surfaces and observed that the mosquito contact time was reduced compared to that on  hydrophilic-liquid-coated surfaces, suggesting that the oil coating  induces an escape response. The observed escape behaviour occurred consistently with several hydrophobic liquids, including silicone oil, which is used globally in personal care products. As the repellent effect is similar to multiple hydrophobic substances, it is likely to be mechanically stimulated owing to the physical properties of the hydrophobic liquids and not due to chemical interactions. On human skin, the contact time was sufficiently short to prevent mosquitoes from  starting to blood-feed. The secretion of *Hippopotamus amphibius*, which has physical properties similar to those of low-viscosity silicone oil, also triggered an escape response, suggesting that it acts as a natural mosquito repellent. Our results are beneficial to develop new, safe, and effective mosquito-repellent technologies. \n\n**\\[SKIN\\]** [**Skin’s protective chains uncovered**](https://www.asiaresearchnews.com/content/skin%E2%80%99s-protective-chains-uncovered-0)\n\n>June 29, 2022 - A new analytical approach has revealed the full range of different ceramides found in the top layer of human skin. The results were published by Hokkaido University scientists in the Journal of Lipid Research and could improve understanding of skin diseases like psoriasis and dermatitis.  \n>  \n>Scientists have struggled to get a full picture of the types of ceramides present in the stratum corneum due to difficulties in separating them from each other and then specifically identifying each one. The technological approaches that have so far been used to do this have not been sensitive enough.  \n>  \n>Professor Akio Kihara and fellow biochemists at Hokkaido University in Japan developed an approach to address this. They used a method called liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry using  the multiple reaction monitoring mode. This approach separates the various ceramides in the skin and then selectively quantifies them by converting molecules into ions that are manipulated in electric and magnetic fields to sort them according to their mass-to-charge ratios.  \n>  \n>By doing so, the team identified 1,327 different unbound ceramides and another 254 that are bound to proteins. They were also able to discover certain details of the ceramides, such as the lengths of their basic structural unit, called the long-chain base and the types of fatty acids they are conjugated to. They found, for example, that the long-chain bases ranged in length from 16 to 26 carbon atoms and that the 18-carbon-atom length was the most abundant.  \n>  \n>Further analyses revealed that an enzyme called serine palmitoyltransferase was important for the diversity in ceramide long-chain base length in human stratum corneum. \n\nStudy: [https://www.jlr.org/article/S0022-2275(22)00068-2/fulltext](https://www.jlr.org/article/S0022-2275(22)00068-2/fulltext)\n\n>This study provides a molecular basis for elucidating human SC ceramide diversity and the pathogenesis of skin disorders. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Feel free to discuss anything you found interesting from the articles above, what you'd like to see more of, or share any other AB-related news you think the sub may be interested in!**",

But at $41 for 20 oz, I couldn't really justify the price. So I did a little research, come to find out all those fancy collagen powders are basically the exact same thing as plain old jello. Gelatin itself is just collagen that has been cooked down and turned into a powder. The expensive powders are just gelatin that has been through an additional process to break it down into smaller molecules which can dissolve in cold drinks. Some claim that the smaller molecules have better bioavailability, but the fact is it all gets digested into the exact same amino acids once it's in our body.   \nI did a quick search on Amazon and found that [Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides](http://a.co/d/2P1O6X0\n) cost $2.04 an ounce, while unflavored [Knox Gelatin](http://a.co/d/2kgKUSp) is only $0.73 an ounce! That's nearly 3x cheaper! Considering the $0.73 is probably an Amazon markup, it's probably even cheaper if you buy it at the grocery store.  \nI've personally been drinking hot water with 2 teaspoons of Jello I had kicking in the back of my pantry dissolved in it. 1) it's not as gross as it sounds, it's sort of like really fruity tea? and 2) I've seen just as good results as I had with VP, with the added benefit that I can continue to use this product without going broke. Thought I'd pass this along to anyone wondering if a fancy collagen powder is worth the price; it's not! Go to the store and buy some gelatin!   \nsource: https://paleoleap.com/all-about-gelatin-and-collagen/   \nedited to add: someone asked about the comparative bioavailability, so I looked it up. Most \"hydrolyzed collagen\" sellers tout 90% bioavailability. This study shows regular gelatin's bioavailability to be between 74.12% and 85.97%. So only marginally lower.  \n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jsfa.7008",

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "Hi folks,\n\nSome thrilling new glycine research came out recently, so I figured I’d give you the highlights.\n\n## Super TLDR\n\nEven though glycine isn’t an essential amino acid, our production and dietary intake generally don't meet demand. As a result, glycine is a limiting factor in collagen synthesis. [This cell culture study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37598999/) suggests that supplementing 5 grams of glycine 2-3x/day may alleviate this deficiency. This won’t “fix” your collagen, but it will ensure that nutrition isn’t the limiting factor in healing and adaptation processes. Getting some extra proline and lysine might be prudent as well.\n\n## Longer TLDR\n\nRegardless of what challenges your body has in regards to connective tissue, you probably don’t want nutritional factors to be the limiting factor in collagen synthesis.\n\nWhen tendons and connective tissue get stronger from resistance training, they do so (in part) by increasing the number of collagen fibrils. So in general, increasing the *quantity* of collagen is desirable, even if the *quality* of each individual fibril isn’t improved.\n\nFrom a collagen synthesis perspective, most people are *deficient in glycine*, because our glycine synthesis pathways are very limited and typical dietary intake is insufficient to make up the difference.\n\nResearchers have suggested supplementing 10-12 grams of glycine daily to optimize collagen synthesis.\n\nSupplementing 5 grams of glycine 2-3x/day is probably better than taking it all at once. Proline and lysine may be important too (perhaps it’s worth getting an extra 5 grams and 2.5 grams per day, respectively).\n\nGlycine has been administered in very high doses without adverse effects. Personal tolerances may vary, but there’s no indication of toxicity concerns.\n\nHydrolyzed collagen could serve as a glycine source, but free amino acids are much easier to absorb, and that’s what these researchers recommend. If you prefer collagen or bone broth, just keep in mind that hydrolyzed collagen is 25-33% glycine and it will have lower absorption. All things considered, people who supplement collagen or bone broth may still want to supplement free glycine as well.\n\nDue to the lack of essential amino acids, neither glycine nor hydrolyzed collagen contribute meaningfully towards your overall protein needs.\n\nThe specific causes and mechanisms behind EDS and HSD are quite varied, so it's possible that increased glycine could be unhelpful (bad) in some cases. Talk to your doctor before making any changes. (I speculated about some scenarios at the end of the post)\n\nTo be clear, these weren't human trials, and the author's recommendations are not tailored to EDS/HSD.\n\n# The glycine rabbit hole\n\nIn research studies, the supplementation of hydrolyzed collagen often results in increased collagen synthesis. This isn’t surprising; collagen is a protein. Most people don’t get all the protein they can benefit from, so if you give them more protein they usually do a better job of building and maintaining lean mass. Collagen is very low quality protein, but your body can burn it for energy or use the constituent amino acids to build new collagen.\n\nThe problem is that those studies usually compare hydrolyzed collagen to a placebo, so they are asking is *“is collagen better than nothing?”* On top of that, the participants usually have mediocre overall protein intake.\n\nThe question I wanted to ask was *“does the supplementation of collagen, or it’s constituent amino acids, increase collagen synthesis when protein intake is already high?”* Since collagen is made from non-essential amino acids, I figured the answer would be *probably not*.\n\nBut I kept looking, and came across this study: [High glycine concentration increases collagen synthesis by articular chondrocytes in vitro: acute glycine deficiency could be an important cause of osteoarthritis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6153947/).\n\nBasically, they took live bovine cartilage and exposed it to various concentrations of glycine, proline, and lysine. What they found was that proline and lysine boosted collagen synthesis at low concentrations, similar to what is commonly circulating in the blood. However, adding more proline and lysine actually diminished the collagen synthesis.\n\nGlycine did something very different. Glycine was increasingly effective at boosting collagen synthesis, even as they increased the concentration *beyond typical physiological levels*. After 15 days, the high glycine condition had increased collagen production by 225% over the control condition.\n\nThe explanation for this is that our glycine synthesis pathways are ancient and more suited to small animals. The pathways didn’t scale up for larger bodies, so all the large mammals are highly reliant on dietary glycine intake.\n\nFrom this, the authors concluded there is a **severe glycine deficiency for collagen synthesis**, and typical intake (1.5-3g/day) leaves us with a 10 gram/day deficiency in glycine.\n\n## Recent findings\n\nMore recently, these rockstar researchers came back with another blockbuster: [Control analysis of collagen synthesis by glycine, proline and lysine in bovine chondrocytes in vitro - Its relevance for medicine and nutrition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37598999/)\n\nIn this one, they tried to figure out why the collagen synthesis process is so absurdly inefficient. We’ve known for a while that most newly synthesized collagen sequences are immediately degraded without ever leaving the cell, but there hasn’t been a good explanation for why we waste all this material and energy. Here is their illustration of the process..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m5sfsyq7zlc1.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8f36cb081943f4b82f8c09ba7164fc065955878\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt turns out, glycine deficiency leads to misfolding of the procollagen sequences. Those misfolded sequences don’t pass quality control standards, so they get recycled without leaving the cell.\n\nThe longer explanation is fascinating. If you look at finished collagen, it contains hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. These hydroxylated versions of proline and lysine are crucial for the triple helix shape of collagen. Unfortunately, our genes can’t code for the hydroxylated amino acids in the sequence. Instead they code for proline or lysine, and then an enzyme has to hydroxylate the appropriate amino acids. This way of doing things results in a terrible, convoluted mess.\n\n>(The enzyme) activity is not imposed only by a specific place (*the where*) but also by its time frame (*the when*). Thus, there must be a synchronization between the rate of synthesis of the chain and the action of hydroxylases.\n\nBasically, as the procollagen sequence is being assembled, an enzyme hydroxylates whatever amino acid is in front of it, and once the enzyme’s substrates are replenished, it hydroxylates again. If the procollagen synthesis is slow (such as due to inadequate glycine), the hydroxylations end up too close together and the procollagen will be defective.\n\nBecause our glycine synthesis pathways can’t keep up with demand, the *rate of synthesis* gets slowed down, and we get hydroxylations in the wrong spots.\n\nThrilling, I know!\n\nHere are the authors’ conclusions..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The shortage of these amino acids must be corrected through the respective nutritional supplements. The 10 g of glycine (generalized deficiency) should be taken in two doses of 5 g each, spaced 12 h apart to avoid excess and spurious excretion and added to a normal diet to reach and maintain a concentration close to 1.00 mM.  \n>  \n>As 10 g is the minimum requirement, this could be extended to three doses of 5 g spaced 8 h apart. According to our results presented here, proline and lysine should also be taken at about 5 g and 2.5 g daily, respectively.  \n>  \n>Amino acids should be taken in powder form to enable their correct absorption, which will make them available for cartilage. These amino acids are commercially available for human consumption.  \n>  \n>It is useless – and not advisable – to take collagen or its hydrolyzate as a source of these amino acids. As glycine is 25% of the mass of collagen, for 10 g of glycine 40 g of collagen would be needed every day, which is close to the total intake of protein. Moreover, the large amount of hydroxylated proline and lysine (products of its digestion or hydrolysis) are not useful because they are metabolized to other products.\n\n# Closing thoughts\n\nI don’t think glycine will cure EDS. In fact, I don’t think most people would *notice* benefits, at least in the short term. But this evidence is compelling to me, and I think maintaining good glycine intake long term could be helpful for many people with or without EDS/HSD.\n\nWhen I’m looking at a supplement, or really any health intervention, I think in terms of *cheapness, safety, and efficacy*. If I think something might be really effective, I’ll spend money on it and accept some risk of side effects. But conversely, if something is *cheap* and *safe* I don’t need it to be life changing. That’s why glycine is great. Maybe it helps in ways I don’t notice, maybe it helps me tremendously. I don’t know. And I don’t need to know. Because it’s cheap enough and safe enough that either scenario is fine.\n\nBulk supplement websites sell it as powder for cheap. You may see it in capsules, but we’re in the big leagues. Powder is the way to go.\n\nI looked at several studies in which people supplemented varying doses of glycine. Long story short, even absurdly high doses of like 60g don’t elevate serum levels much more than lower doses (like 10g). Basically, if you want to optimize glycine intake, the best option is to supplement 5g or more several times per day. For example, you could supplement glycine with every meal, and/or you could mix it with water and drink it throughout the day.\n\nI’m going to make a mix of glycine, proline, and lysine. I haven’t settled on a recipe, but each scoop might contain 5g glycine, 2g proline, and 1g lysine. All of these amino acids are fairly innocuous *in my opinion*, but most lysine supplements are actually lysine hydrochloride. Which is fine, but high doses (I think I saw 10g as an example) might cause GI upset. Anyway, I could see supplementing this 3-5x/day. You could add vitamin C if you want. These researchers didn’t find it helped, but there are indications of modest boosts in collagen synthesis in other studies.\n\nBut the thing is, you don’t have to optimize this; you can keep it simple. I supplemented 10g glycine every evening for years. It was simple, it cost \\~$0.32/day, and got me solid glycine levels overnight when my body was healing and adapting from training.\n\nAlso, if you have limited money to spend, general protein intake may be more important for some people. The RDA for protein is 0.8 grams per kg of bodyweight daily. The RDA is commonly viewed as the minimum, rather than the optimal level. When people get more protein than that, their bodies tend to do a better job of building and maintaining lean mass. Getting to 1.2g/kg/day is pretty sensible in most cases, especially if you’re trying to build muscle or prevent muscle loss. There may be benefits to going higher, but the cost-benefit tapers off.\n\nAlso, on the topic of hydrolyzed collagen supplements and bone broth.. I’m confident that free amino acids are more effective for increasing serum glycine levels. You just don’t see as big of an increase in serum glycine levels with hydrolyzed collagen, even with high doses. And these researchers clearly come down on the side of free amino acids being more effective.\n\nBut here’s the thing. For years people have been asking *“could collagen help?”* and they got shot down. There is an excessively dismissive and defensive attitude in EDS/HSD circles regarding the potential role of nutrition and supplementation in connective tissue health. Everyone is so focused on “this won’t cure EDS” that they forget that there are a lot of factors that influence the quantity and quality of collagen structures in human beings.\n\nSo if someone reads all this and still wonders if collagen or bone broth could have unique value, I’m not going to shoot them down. I have my opinions, but ultimately I hope other people make decisions based on *their* understanding and *their* priorities.\n\n# What could go wrong?\n\nSome people in EDS circles seem to view their collagen as “bad”, in the sense that having more of it would be worse. I haven’t seen a physiological explanation of how that might be the case, but I can speculate about some concerns that might pop up.\n\nFibrosis involves excess collagen production. So could increasing collagen synthesis exacerbate fibrosis? My understanding is that fibrosis involves disregulated inflammatory responses and other issues. It’s not just too much collagen. So I think adequate glycine is more likely to support homeostasis than exacerbate the problem, but I don’t know for sure.\n\nThere are a several checks and balances in the regulation of collagen synthesis. As an example, when procollagen fibrils are transported outside the cell, the terminal ends get trimmed off so the procollagen can be incorporated into functional tissues. That snipped off end functions as a feedback mechanism, which tells the cell *“congratulations, we made collagen”*, and the cell dials back the synthesis rate. If those terminal ends don’t get trimmed off, the cell assumes that the collagen formation wasn’t successful and it keeps pumping out procollagen fibrils.\n\n[In some types of EDS](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.182.4109.298) the enzyme which removes the terminal ends of some types of procollagen fibrils is defective. So those folks have a bunch of procollagen fibrils floating around doing nothing useful. I don’t see that as being a hazard in itself, but it’s possible that other types of disruptions in the collagen synthesis process could lead to more troublesome situations if glycine is no longer the limiting factor in synthesis.\n\nBut there’s another potential issue: we could be exacerbating imbalances in the ratio of collagen types. For example, some types of EDS cause unique “cauliflower” formations of collagen. The issue (from my understanding) is that type V collagen helps limit the size of collagen fibrils, and due to the disrupted synthesis of type V collagen, the ratio of collagen types is imbalanced and things get weird.\n\nI don't know the details of that specific mutation, but in general, we could imagine someone who increased their glycine intake, and got a nice boost in the production all collagen types *except type V*. This could result in less type V as a portion of the total (i.e. the ratio gets worse). Perhaps for some people, having less collagen at a better ratio might be preferable.\n\nOn the other hand, no matter how much glycine you ingest, there is a cap on how much collagen you will produce. If someone had a problem with procollagen synthesis which resulted in a high percentage of defective procollagen fibrils of a certain type.. glycine might increase the success rate or simply allow the cell to make many more attempts. We could imagine a scenario where the other types of collagen only get a small boost (let’s call it 20%). But maybe the cells trying to produce the defective type of collagen will now be able to dramatically increase procollagen synthesis (i.e. they will make more attempts to get it right), and perhaps that could lead to a greater increase in production (for example 50%). Thus, more collagen and a better ratio.\n\nClearly, I’m just speculating here. Overall, I see the supplementation of glycine as simply addressing a nutritional deficiency, which is most likely to have neutral or positive effects. But it’s possible that it could have a negative effect in some cases.\n\nHow you approach this decision is up to you.",

Dairy contains plenty of lysine, but if folks get calcium from non-dairy sources taking lysine with those foods might make some sense. \n\nI’ve started taking glycine more recently (6 months maybe?) for sleep.  And I do think I’ve probably gotten some pain reduction benefit from it. But I’ve definitely gotten a sleep benefit, as is very clear from my sleep journal. \n\nKeep in mind, though, that glycine at higher doses may not be safe: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=170.50 But the FDA wrote that at a time when glycine was widely used as a food additive sweetener. My guess is that doses were pretty high. I just don’t know what the safe vs unsafe cut-off actually is.",

Does make skin pleasantly plump and bouncy. Not likely to be effective for dark spots despite claim as niacinamide and ascorbyl glucoside (vitamin C derivative) both likely below 1%. However, these ingredients may still provide slight barrier support and antioxidant benefits. \n* **Skin Nutrition Botanicals Tea Tree Oil + Salicylic Acid Balancing Face Wash, 4 oz** - A mild, non-drying face wash with two chemical exfoliants (is the AHA ingredient citric acid?), witch hazel and most interesting to me, tea tree oil. I’ve heard that tea tree oil can substitute for benzoyl peroxide (very effective, but bleached clothes) so I wanted to check this cleanser out. I think day and night use helped my mild acne not get worse. But does not eliminate acne like a leave on benzoyl peroxide cream (as expected). I needed to dial back on this cleanser as I began some other actives and my skin was getting dry. \n* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Skin Cream, 1.7 oz** - has squalane, a non-comedogenic oil, and peptides. Very pleasant, lightweight gel serum texture, just like the eye serum in the same line. Fragrance free. I’ve heard that collagen (hydrolyzed collagen) in skincare doesn’t do much. But I think this is a nice basic moisturizer for someone with oily or combination skin. \n\n##B Pure Lip Mask vs Aquaphor \n\n* **B Pure Hydrating Night Lip Mask** - Finally saw this super popular lip balm in stock! Immediate impression: surprised at the pink color of the balm (expected clear), and didn’t really care for the taste (like fruity crayon). Luckily the taste goes away. The texture is thick and did remind me of **Aquaphor Lip Protectant SPF 30**, which is a little thinner than the regular **Advanced Therapy Healing Ointment** (which can also be used for lips). \n\nI thought that the pink tint was so minimal as to be effectively colorless. But actually, comparing B Pure and the two Aquaphor (both clear) that I have side by side on my lips, a bit of pink tint does come through on my light color lips. As far as other observations, I think the B Pure is the best looking as it’s slightly glassier. And also somehow fills in all my lip lines. If you want a subtly pouty look, I think B Pure is a good choice. However if you want sheen but not gloss, I think the two Aquaphor is more subtle. The Aquaphor Advanced Therapy (large tube) is the least glossy, but also does the least when it comes to filling in lip lines. But does also contain soothing bisabolol (chamomile) where the other two doesn’t. \n\nOverall I still like Aquaphor Lip Protectant SPF 30 because it doesn’t have any taste at all and also has a high amount of sunscreen (most have spf 15). But it’s also $5-7 for 0.35 oz, and B Pure is $1.25 for the same 0.35 size (despite the larger looking tube). I still think the B Pure is the better looking cosmetic though. And does feel luxe on the lips. Give it a try!\n\n##Dental \n\n* **Guru Nanda Ultimate 2 in 1 Floss Picks Wild Mint, 40 count** - First of all, these floss picks don’t really have a taste. Secondly, the actual floss pick is a bit small. But the reason I got these picks was actually the soft rubber interdental pick on the end. Wow, what a great value. A pack of 60 count CVS brand soft picks is $6-7. Now, I haven’t tried any interdental pick before, so I don’t have any comparison. But the soft rubber tip here feels soft on the teeth while holding shape. The tapered end means it fits a bit smaller to larger gaps between teeth. The size is probably best for those with medium to large gaps in their teeth like I have. Using this interdental pick raised my gum line the next day. A bonus feature is I can break the pick in half to remove the floss pick side, so I can fit the pick to my back teeth. However, I don’t think the interdental pick is firm enough for the toughest spot behind my last molar. \n* **Guru Nanda Interdental Brushes Mint Flavor, 4 count, with cap** - This interdental pick is shorter than the 2 in 1 floss pick and also has a cap for storage. Says it can be used up to ten times. Doesn’t have a strong flavor either. The brush head is made of metal wire and can be bent to fit tougher spaces. The brush size is slimmer for medium gaps, not large. But it cannot fit the tightest spaces. The bristles feel stiffer, rougher, for a better clean, but does make me worried about abrasion over time. The metal wire is also poke-y pretty much like pipe cleaner for craft making. I don’t think I’ll get this again as despite its capacity to bend to shape, it’s still not firm enough for my back of the mouth spaces. And I’m concerned about the roughness on teeth. However, as I said I haven’t gotten interdental picks before, so I don’t know if the brush quality is standard. \n\n##Fragrance \n\n* **Power Stick Body Spray Paradise Breeze, 3.5 oz** - Fragrance notes are “black amber plum and vanilla woods.” The fragrance is really very different from the name. I expect “paradise breeze” to smell tropical. But it is accurate to the fragrance notes. Like a nighttime scent. Reminds me of **Bath and Body Works Into the Night**. A bit of mocha. But without the stronger and lasting wood notes. Also related to the plum notes of **Viva Vanilla**, but less sweet, less vanilla, and much less powerful (that one is a beast!). \n\nThe spray is powerful with butane and propane as propellants, perhaps similar to Axe body spray or the propellant of a can of whipped cream or WD-40. \n\nThe fragrance is there. It’s sufficient like Bath and Body Works’ milder body mists. But it doesn’t seem to project a lot and I mostly forget I’m wearing it. I also think the fragrance is just a bit musty. However it’s not bad at all and if you’re interested I say go for it. Pretty unique fragrance that does smell more expensive than its price point. I wanted it to be a Viva Vanilla dupe, and it isn’t. But I also don’t have anything like it. Not mad! \n\n##Which would I buy again?\n\nDefinitely the Guru Nanda 2 in 1 soft rubber picks. I also think the Skin Nutrition Botanicals multi peptide serum and cleanser are effective, well formulated products. I’m a fan of the Global Beauty Care collagen cream too, but usually look for moisturizers with niacinamide for hyperpigmentation benefit.\n\nI think the B Pure lip mask is a great value for those who don’t mind the taste, and want a subtly tinted, glossy, hydrating lip product that fills in lip lines. I do mind the taste, and I’m not pressed about appearance of my lip at night time, which is when I’d use this lip mask (using spf lip balm during the day). So it might be a one and done purchase for me. However, I think others will be pleasantly surprised! \n\nDon’t really like the high pressure propellant of the Power Stick body spray since I just spray on my wrists. But it would be a good buy for someone who wants to quickly douse their whole body head to toe in a light fragrance. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "I'm just going to give my perspective on what helped my particular situation, please take what I say with a pinch of salt as I think it was a multitude of things and wasn't one product or supplement. I am still learning but can say my brain fog is pretty much gone!\n\n**Background:** I used to be really clever and sharp back when I was  around 15 years old but gradually I developed \"Brain Fog\" without even knowing and got worse ever since. At the age of 25 I was working for a large organisation and really struggled to retain any information, make connections between ideas, had terrible anxiety and so on. So I started researching about what was going on and realized brain fog was a \"thing\". The conventional doctors could not help with my brain fog or digestion so I started learning from functional medicine doctors.\n\n**Realizations:** I am still learning about what is going on but I've learnt there is a connection between the gut, anxiety, inflammation and brain fog. Whenever my gut and digestion are working properly then my anxiety and brain fog is under control. A lot of what I learnt was from Dr Justin Marchegiani on Youtube and I highly recommend checking out his channel.\n\n**What I did:**\n\n1. Fix the gut \\- I did whatever I could to improve my digestion as I've had \"IBS\" for about 8+ years. As per Dr Justin I incorporated Betain HCL with every meal which had protein. This increases your stomach acid which helps digestion of protein and also helps the release of enzymes. You can also take enzyme supplements. I still continue to take Betain HCL to this day and can't live without it. I also cut out most of the grains in my diet as I felt it made my symptoms worse. Make sure you eat your meals in a relaxed state and chew thoroughly.\n2. Breakfast - Dr Jordan Peterson touched on this also but you want a breakfast high in protein and fat which stabilizes your blood sugar and helps anxiety. My go to is a green smoothie which includes frozen blueberries, banana, frozen kale, 1 avacado, pea protein, hydrolyzed collagen power and half a lemon.\n3. Inflammation - Dr Justin talks about this in his brain fog video but high inflammation can lead to brain fog type symptoms. Eating clean foods helped with this but I also take tumeric + black pepper supplement everyday. A recent blood test I took showed that my C Reactive Protein was low, showing that my inflammation is under control. I also cut down my alcohol binging which tends to makes my inflammation worse. \n4. Control anxiety - I used to be a really anxious person which made my digestion suck, which made my brain fog worse! The breakfast is key but I also started taking Liposomal GABA every morning to get me out of that fight or flight response. I have also been taking Ashwagandha KSM-66 supplement for the past few months.\n\nThis has just been a brain dump of my findings in the past year, hope this helps someone out there. I would recommend experimenting and seeing what works, good luck on your journey :)",

In the past three months of collagen powder supplementation, my flexibility and mobility has increased more than in the last three years of consistent stretching and mobility work. \n\nFor years, my stretching/mobility regimen has seemed limited to merely preventing further loss of range of motion. I’m now seeing actual improvement in range of motion and strength in that range of motion. Specifically, referring to my lower body and hips. The only change has been the addition of kettlebell exercises (Turkish get ups and arm bars) once per week (which should be primarily targeting shoulders). My stretching/mobility routine is the same. \n\nWhy did I keep the same routine for years if it wasn’t improving? Because if I stopped, I would quickly lose what little flexibility/mobility I had.\n\nI acknowledge that the KB work might be responsible for all of it. Who knows, maybe increasing the strength and range of motion in my shoulders has had a net positive effect on the rest of my body. I’m hesitant to stop either KB work or collagen supplementation. At worst it has no effect (bad or good). At best, it has been the missing ingredient I’ve needed all this time. It’s like $30/month. Worth it for the continued experimentation, in my opinion.\n\nI’m also in my mid-thirties. I doubt it would have an effect (if it is having an effect) if I were in my teens or early twenties.",

    "body": "Dupe of Beauty of Joseon?\nHi, I have recently tried a few products from Korea. While they are not the exact products of Beauty of Joseon, some of the ingredients are similar but of course not exactly the same.  Some of the products are particularly popular in Korea at the moment because Hanbang and plant based?\n\n[KIcho Sheep Oil](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-kicho-sheep-oil-cream.html)\n-this product is free from T.E.A, artificial scents, mineral oil, isopropyl alcohol, paraben, urea, heavy metals and formaldehyde.   Since it is anti aging product and is for dry skin, it contains a lot of plants extract(8 types of berries), essential oil, beeswax, silicone, shea butter hyaluronic acid and oils(grapefruit,lemon, orange) Dimethicone is the second ingredients after water.   So, it can be clogging if you do not like those ingredients.  The moisture lasted whole day.  There are ceramide, lanolin, collagen and sea water. No butylene glycol. (press sample, no affiliate link)\n \n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Essence](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi.html)\nThis is a hanbang skincare from Korea. Niacinamide is high on the list along with a lot of hanbang which include the famous ginseng ingredients(6 fermented years). It has floral scent to it. Texture is light and absorb well.  It has Triethanol amine  which some said it is dangerous but it is not a problem for me.  No paraben.( press sample ,no affiliate link)\n\n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Cream](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi_28.html)\nIt has the same hanbang ingredients(fermented 6 years ginseng) in the cream with the same smell but with different kind of texture. It is pretty light and calming. The jar is of course luxurious and looks like a blue pearl. Niacinamide is lower than the essence but it is still high. No paraben but contains Triethanol amine  to adjust the ph.

May sound weird, but I found that a lot of news stories were making me annoyed. There is so much stupid shit going on in the world. Shutting it out doesn't make it go a way, but it sure as heck helped my mood improve. People often ask, \"Well, how will you know what's going on?\" I guess I figured when things get extremely bad, I'll hear about from someone or somewhere. It really has made an enormous difference (I guess ignorance can be blissful, lol). If you don't want to cut it all out entirely, maybe cutting back might help with your mood. All my time now is focused on family, my gym training (been at it for 16 years consecutively now), and my career. I spend little time on social media, and I'm very selective about the stories I read or posts I reply to. I know some may criticize the decision to block out the noise, but it really has improved my mood and well being significantly.",

Let me put it to you this way: If the benefits you get from a diligent practice were found in a drug, this would be either illegal, either prohibitively expensive and only enjoyed by the very wealthy, or it would come with horrific side effects. Mindfulness meditation improves awareness, attention, emotional stability, and lets you become more free from negative emotions. There's nothing \"spooky\" behind why, it just so happens that attention is the specific tool to free yourself from these states, and the meditation is what trains the attention towards thoughts and emotions. When you suffer these negative states, you are not clearly aware of their arising, but you're lost in them(think back to when you were angry, or anxious-- they have a certain dreamlike character, and a character of a hostage situation-- you can't freely exit them, they take over, until they're done). Except when you're mindful-- **you** take over. That's the *meaning* of mindfulness. Best of luck.",

        "body": "Salute to you my friend, the title made my day 🤣 \n\nI’m no expert in this field or how these things relate specifically to aging, so read into anything I say but here are my recommendations \n\n**Lithium orotate** - increases neurotrophic (as well as vascular) growth factors + *desensitises the post-synaptic norepinephrine receptor* reducing norepinephrine release which can mitigate aggression. **LO** also *boosts serotonin signalling* also (usually) decreasing aggression and boosting happy feelings. **Lithium Orotate** is a *much, much smaller dose than the Lithium Carbonate prescribed in mania* and lithium is considered by some an essential nutrient. As a plus it has actions on *telomerase* extending the life of *telomeres* which play a large role in the aging process as a whole. References: https://nootropicsexpert.com/lithium-orotate/   Examine.com doesn’t cover this one for some reason.\n\nApart from that, I’d try the classics **L-Theanine** and/or **Taurine**, L-theanine being an amino found in tea (supplements provide larger and more noticeable dose) and taurine being an amino made in the body and found in food that plays a role in the *GABA system* which is the inhibitory or calming system in the nervous system. It’s abundant in many parts of the body and is truly one of the cheapest life hacks anyone can implement for overall health and well being. Fun fact, it’s also the reason cats need to eat meat as they can not produce it on their own, while they can make vitamin C - us being the opposite. References: https://examine.com/supplements/theanine/   https://examine.com/supplements/taurine/\n\nAnother supplement to look into before the last paragraph would be **Lemon Balm** a *GABA-Transaminase inhibitor* (inhibits breakdown of your naturally produced GABA) and *Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor* (inhibits breakdown of Acetylcholine which is generally good for cognition, especially in the aging, effects on mood if any vary between people although lemon balm is known for its calming effect) https://examine.com/supplements/lemon-balm/\n\nFollowing these I’d look into **Saffron** (find the best source you can with the ideal % of each active ingredient, I believe there are a few and they vary in effects and their amount present in different varieties) however I personally do not know much specifically about this one apart from seeing a lot of positive anecdotal reports and - someone correct me if I’m wrong here - has shown efficacy in head-to-head trials against SSRI’s. https://examine.com/supplements/saffron/\n\n>!If worst comes to worst and all other avenues are exhausted, (don’t hate me for this guys) you could evaluate whether the symptoms are worth starting an SSRI for some time until stabilisation, fluvoxamine with side sigma agonism is my favourite (protection from the big bad flu going around, neurogenesis and added creation of oligodendrocytes) and also forces one to quit caffeine which can reduce hostility symptoms.!< However these can cause loss of bone mineral density, for which **boron** can help and is something I would take as I age as well. https://examine.com/supplements/boron/",

        "body": "Start with:   \n\n- Magnesium: Just take some. Often Glycinate is recommended. Some people become more anxious and agressive with this, in which case Citrate, Malate, Taurate are good alternatives. I take Natural Calm which is a popular product and is Citrate. You could consider Magnesium Threonate also.   \n- Taurine: Consider 3g/day on some split.  \n- Work in some Vitamin C and maybe Vitamin E. I like Solaray Vitamin C w/Bioflavanoids 1:1 Ratio, and Life Extension Gamma E Mixed Tocopherols/Tocotreinols.   \n\nThen:   \n\n- Fish Oil Omega 3: Look for an IFOS certified product or Nordic Naturals. Aim for 2-4g/day.   \n- Curcumin: Consider Thorne Meriva, 1 cap/day.   \n\nAlso consider:   \n\n- Black Seed Oil.  \n- Wild Blueberry.  \n- Other polyphenols such as elderberry, tart cherry.  \n- Green tea extract.  \n- Maybe Boswellia.  \n\nThe theme here is anti-inflammatories, and it's no accident.",

Unless I’m missing some new breakthrough research, neither will do anything at all at this percentage. \n\nSo at this point I’m wondering what even is the purpose of adding these? Are they there just for marketing? If the main ingredients are water, DG and glycerin then they’re no different than much cheaper toner pads and if ingredients are added at the same tiny percentages in the other versions of these toner pads, are they really that different from each other? I don’t know about USA but these toner pads are fairly expensive on Stylevana IT, €40 for a pack of 100. And I see nothing in the ingredient list that makes them worth anything more than those being sold for €12-15.\n\nHave you seen any other products that use a certain active ingredient to market it but then it’s not added at a percentage where it can be beneficial to the skin?",

I'm interested in the results, and if there is cost effective supplementation you know of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DL\n\nYou can feed muscle after exercise due to the way they get bloodflow. This doesn't work for tendons. You have to preload the nutrients before exercise to get them into the tendon and ligament. According to a study he cites, the way to do this effectively is with **vitamin C enriched hydrolyzed collagen**. He now sells a [line of supplements](https://physivantage.com/products/supercharged-collagen) to fill this niche.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question to any of you: Can you find or do you know of any supplements or stacks with close to the same amino acid profiles as the supplements he sells? It is definitely a much broader profile than any BCAA's I've taken. The vitamin c enriched aspect is simple to supplement, just take the amino acids with anything containing ascorbic acid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: [Something close to the same nutritional info, just add orange juice.](https://www.amazon.ca/Premium-Collagen-Peptides-Certified-Friendly/dp/B00XQ2XGAA/ref=sr_1_5?crid=WTHEO521QMBA&keywords=hydrolyzed+collagen+powder&qid=1554132239&refinements=p_85%3A5690392011&rnid=5690384011&rps=1&s=gateway&sprefix=hydroly%2Caps%2C159&sr=8-5)",

I hope its okay to list a few examples that aren't as well, just to give you a better picture:\n\n* **Sulwhasoo's Overnight Vitalizing Mask**\n\n*(I used a sample, but I haven't purchased yet)*\n\n> **Notable ingredients:** Patented \"RED Elixer (Pomegranant extract + Jujuba?)\" Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Tocopherol, licorice root extract, hyaluronic acid, beta-glucan, green tea extract, Squalane oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, hyaluronic acid, silica, Lecithin, Shea Butter, Honey, mulberry extract, white mulberry extract, lotus seed extract, tiger lily extract, Chinese foxglove root extract, walnut shell extract, Solomon seal, cocoa seed extract \n\n> *and other herbs* Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract (golden herb), Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Chrysanthemum Morifolium Flower Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Adenophora Stricta Root Extract, Angelica Tenuissima Root Extract, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Trehalose,  \n\n* **Kate Ryan’s Total Nutrition Night Repair Complex** \n\n*(Its currently sold out / I haven't purchased it yet)*\n\n> **Notable ingredients:** centella asiatica, Hyaluronic acid, Fermented sea kelp, ubiquinone, resveratrol, green tea extract, turmeric extract, tocotrienols, DMAE, Astaxanthin, Niacinamide, Retinyl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Allantoin, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Beta-Carotene, Tocotrienols, Tocopherol, **oils** jojoba, Squalane, pomegranant, Sesame Seed, Sweet Almond, Avocado Oil, Coconut Endosperm Extract, \n\n* **Faded Topicals**\n\n> **Notable Ingredients** Tranexamic acid, licorice root, kojic acid, tumuric butter, azelaic acid, Squalane, niacinamide, alpha-arbutin,  Allantoin, Centella Asiatica extract, argenine, Lecithin, soybean, triglycerides, jojoba, shea butter, glycerin, melatonin",

        "body": "I think sometimes it’s risky AND difficult to formulate products with a TON of those star ingredients. The more you put in, the less of each great ingredient you can include, and the more people you start to isolate because of personal sensitivities or dislikes. For instance, many people are sensitive to Niacinamide. Or for me personally, shea butter makes me SUPER itchy and ruined my lips.\n\nAB I think lends itself to potentially including more of these ingredients because concentrations aren’t usually as intense as western products are. Plus, AB typically swaps out boring water for “special ingredient” waters like Centella asiatica leaf water. But, this also begs the question of at what point are these ingredients so diluted that they don’t offer real benefit anymore? How much of “Centella asiatica water” is actually active good stuff from Centella, like Madecassic Acid? How concentrated is centella extract vs water, too?\n\nTake something like **Purito’s Centella Unscented Serum.** On the surface, it seems just marketed as a Centella serum because… that’s what it is, mostly. But also contains: ceramide, Hyaluronic acid, peptides, arginine, panethenol, tea leaf extract, sea daffodil extract, and even a component of licorice root extract and adenosine. Plus jojoba technically too. Look at how much of its list could be considered a star ingredient.\n\nIngredients per Stylevana: **Centella Asiatica Extract(49%)**, Water, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol,\nGlycereth-26, **Ceramide NP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Dipeptide-10,** Carbomer, **Arginine,** Sclerotium Gum, **Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters,** Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, **Panthenol,** Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, **Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract,Pancratium Maritimum Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Disodium EDTA, **Adenosine**.\n\nThe reality is I have no idea if these ingredients are in concentrations that would be beneficial to me. Other than being pretty sure on the Centella stuff, the adenosine, I have no clue if switching to this as my main source of panthenol would be enough?\n\nAnother example is **Peach + Lily’s Transparen-C Pro Spot Treatment.** It’s in an oil format, so depending on you personally classify individual oils, it could be totally full of numerous good things. For me personally I get a bit excited about: the vitamin C derivative, jojoba, squalane, the three forms of Hyaluronic acid, licorice root extract, ferulic acid, tranexamic acid, kojic dipalmitate, and maybe the vitamin e too. \n\nHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Squalane, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tocopherol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tranexamic Acid, Kojic Dipalmitate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water (Aqua)\n\nTheir FAQs state that there is less than 0.5% of the tranexamic acid and kojic acid COMBINED, though, so I’m not sure how excited to get about  those ingredients. If those are less than half a percent, will there be enough of my favorite oil squalane? Since I only know it to definitively have a high percent of vitamin C, I’m waiting until I finish one of C products to switch to this one… it’ll combine my morning C + oil, but honestly probably nothing else.\n\nI just started using the **Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium Light Lotion** as well, and although I see multiple star ingredients (tranexamic acid, dipotassiun glycyrrhizate, two forms of Hyaluronic acid, vitamin C), I anticipate that the concentration of the vitamin c is so much lower than what I need for it to be effective and essentially use it only for tranexamic acid in a hydrating toner step… which I also really don’t know it’s concentration either. Maybe I’d actually be better off with a serum of a known high amount of TXA and very little else, even.\n\nDon’t get me wrong- I’m here for adding more good things in if it doesn’t compromise the formula (eg, using extracts and special waters to replace boring water). I figure even if it the ingredient isn’t in a high enough concentration for me to notice effects, “every little bit counts” in those cases. I’m also here for combining more steps and ingredients into singular products! I just think there’s probably a point where stuffing more good stuff into a product actually makes the product overall less effective, so I’m wary about products with a ton of those really good things in them.",

        "body": "ETA:  I think it’s much more difficult to find an elegant product that effectively harnesses one or two star ingredients.  I pay a lot of money for a cleanser that has very few ingredients because my skin is ridiculously sensitive.  But it’s elegantly formulated to make use of very gentle surfactants, has no fragrances or oil, and is low ph.  \n\nIf you can find a product that can do this, that’s a win in my book.  I gravitate toward the single ingredient formulations that may have fillers, but they are fillers that are exceeded helpful for making the single ingredient work better.  That’s something to consider.  An ingredient doesn’t need to be an active to be useful. \n\nThere’s some middle ground between filler and active, is what I’m saying.\n\n—————————————————\n\nWhat I love about AB is precisely the one-star ingredients factor with mild fillers.  That allows me to layer and use what I need that day, ingredients-wise.\n\nIt might be more helpful to consider the guidelines for listing ingredients:\n\nIf less than a certain percentage, or an extract/ botanical it can be listed *anywhere* on the label.  It doesn’t have to go behind the ingredients that comprise the majority of the product.  If it is not an extract/ botanical/ fragrance and less than one %, such as preservatives, it *does* have to go behind the main ingredients in descending order of amount.  \n\nSo, this means a botanical could hypothetically comprise less than .01 of the ingredients and be listed *second.*. You will think you are getting that botanical in large quantities, but it is in fact a filler. \n\nSo, the point is, fillers are fillers are fillers.  Either way, a moisturizer is constituted of oil/water, emollients/ occlusives/ humectants, preservatives.  That’s what’s required.  Pretty much everything else is either an additional active or filler, or both, which may or may not help. \n\nI think your desire for complex ingredients conflates “complex” and “lots of stuff which may or may not be an active.”  \n\nAlso:  I do think, contrary to most people, that even small amounts tend to do *something*.  They can definitely break you out, so they can also definitely help too.  \n\nPerhaps focus on the ingredients you definitely want and choose the product based on that.",

I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon.

Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging.

It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@!

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

And it’s not water-resistant, so it will on glide on your face as you sweat. But the absolute worst thing about this is how much it stings your eyes. I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

I got it for Rs. 575/-.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Arginine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Tripeptide-1, Hexapeptide-9, Hexapeptide-11, Copper Tripeptide-1\n\n**My Skin Type:** Combination skin with an oily T-zone\n\n**Usage:** Since Past 6 months\n\n**My Experience:** I absolutely enjoyed using this toner for the past few months. Here's why, this has a lightweight texture, thicker than water but thinner than a serum/gel, that gets absorbed on your skin easily. My skin never felt sticky or greasy on application. It used to get absorbed within a few minutes, even when I mistakenly applied it excessively. \n\nIt's a very hydrating. Due to seasonal change, my skin had become very dry. Whenever I applied this toner, I instantly felt a calming effect on my skin, and it helped lessening the dryness for a while. Obviously it ain't enough as you need a hydrating Moisturizer to go along with it. \n\nThis one has fragrance, but it wasn't too overpowering. If you're someone who can tolerate a little fragrance, you'll be okay. \n\nMy favourite part is how easy it's on your pocket. The price might appear a bit high, but the quantity makes up for the price. As listed above, I've been using the toner since last 6 months daily, still 30-40% is left. \n\n**WRP:** Maybe Yes. Why Maybe? Coz I'm a victim of FOMO who wants to keep on trying new skincare items. If I'm able to stick to one product, I can see SNP toner becoming a part of my regular routine.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:** A fantastic but underrated product.",

But the physical store still has the label claiming all the Goku-jyun Alpha products have retinol.\n\nHowever, the [Hada Labo SG website](https://www.hadalabo.com.sg/antiageing-1) only lists **one** product in the Goku-jyun Alpha range as having retinol. I will have to check again to see if the Anti-aging + 3D Gel Moisturiser actually has retinol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have several questions:\n\n1. Why is a different version of the product being sold in Singapore? (If it's because Singapore has tighter restrictions on retinoids, why are other products containing retinyl palmitate sold normally?)\n2. Why are stores selling the Lifting+Firming Lotion (Rich) as having retinol, when it actually doesn't?\n3. Is this incompetence, or intentionally false/misleading marketing?\n4. Are there other regions selling the non-retinol version of the \"red\" range?",

    "body": "I work in aging biology, and a few weeks ago an interesting paper came out claiming that \"Glycine supplementation extends lifespan of male and female mice.\" ([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12953](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12953)) The paper is open-access, but TL;DR: the US National Institute on Aging (one section of the NIH) runs what it calls the Intervention Testing Program, which administers potentially useful compounds for protecting against aging to mice at three independent facilities in a double-blinded standardized format. When they upped mouse diet to 8% glycine by weight (from \\~2% normally) both male and female mice lived \\~5% longer.\n\nI did some cursory digging, and found a lot of clickbait-y links advocating for glycine for bodybuilding, tendon repair, skin health in aging, and sleep quality. I pinged /u/KarlWalters, who commented that he'd tried it before he started climbing, and felt stronger taking it, but also felt sleepier & slept longer; I've struggled with insomnia for \\~2 decades so I figured that was probably an advantage, and ordered a kilo of it off Amazon.\n\nI've been taking a heaping spoon (13g) of powdered, pure glycine mixed into water before going to sleep most evenings for the past \\~3 weeks, and sometimes another blended into a smoothie in the afternoon at work. Two interesting things have happened.\n\n* I do feel like I'm sleeping better, and according to my Fitbit I'm averaging an extra half hour or so a night (up from \\~5.5h to \\~6h per night, so still less than ideal).\n* My fingers don't seem to tweak as easily; I'm not as sore after a session of crimpy bouldering, and once or twice when I've started to feel sore after a too-hard move, things feel fine the next day. In the past I've been \\[unusually?\\] prone to pulley injuries & chronic finger soreness, and I can handle a much higher load of bouldering now without pain. This was much more surprising than the sleep benefit.\n\nGlycine is a major component of collagen, which a lot of people seem to take for climbing-related soft tissue repair (and dietary collagen supplementation may enhance collagen repair in your body; results are unclear from the literature off Pubmed). Have any of you tried taking glycine vs hydrolyzed collagen? Anything interesting to report?",

But if you're taking Glycine by itself, it's not going to form these tripeptides during the digestion process (as other amino acids are needed, and that's just not how things work). That being said, it doesn't mean that your body doesn't use the extra glycine to form these tripeptides, just that it doesn't come preassembled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I have no clue.",

Butylene Glycol, Haematococcus Pluvialis Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Laminaria extract, Carnitine, Ubiquinone, Collagen, Sodium acetylhyaluronate, Rose Hip Oil, Glyceryl Tricaprylate-caprate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Octanediol*\n\n**Product smell, texture & finish:** Lightly scented, viscous fluid that finishes dewy and a bit sticky.\n\n**Product effects compared to claims:** I can't speak for any anti aging clams, since that was not one of my goals, but for hydration it does okay. I haven't noticed any significant changes in my skin since starting to use it. No significant plumping, and hydration wise, I've also noticed minimal effect.\n\n**Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products:** It's a hydrating lotion, so for me it comes right after double cleansing. It does not help with the absorption of other products, it does however make sticky products even stickier since it itself is a viscous, almost slimy feeling fluid. It absorbs much slower than some other lotions I've used in the past.\n\n**How long it has been used for:** Approx. 4 weeks\n\n**Has it been/will it be repurchased:** No, I will be trying other products.\n\n**Concluding remarks:** Overall, it filled a step in my routine as I was waiting for another lotion to come, but I feel that it does not deliver any particular effect in regards to plumping and even hydration. It was just... okay.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Review no.2*\n\n**Full Product Name:** Meishoku Ceracolla Super Moist Lotion\n\n**Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate:** Combo/Fair Olive/Hot & Humid\n\n**Reason for Use:**Hydration & plumping\n\n**Product Size & Price:** [180ml/11,12€](https://www.amazon.de/Ceracolla-Skin-Lotion-180ml-Super/dp/B00IJSWSBE/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499675589&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=meishoku+ceracolla)\n\n**Packaging:** Drip bottle, very precise. You can easily measure out droplets to evade wasting product.\n\n**Ingredients:** (according to Cosdna)\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene glycol, Methyl gluceth-10, PEG-75, Ceramide, Ceramide 3, CERAMIDE 6 II, Hydrolyzed collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium chloride, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben*\n\n**Product smell, texture & finish:** Scented fluid, ever-so-slightly viscous. Smells like a baby-oriented product, I find it very pleasant.\n\n**Product effects compared to claims:** Quite nice, I've noticed a few changes in hydration levels since starting its use. My skin also appears slightly plumper.\n\n**Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products:** Another hydration lotion which comes right after double cleansing. It's a thin liquid that absorbs fairly easily and does not leave my skin feeling sticky unless I use it for the 3/7 skin method. \n\n**How long it has been used for:** 1 month\n\n**Has it been/will it be repurchased:** Yes, most likely, although I will continue searching for better products. This will work nicely as a secondary hydrating lotion (yes, I'm a product hoarder).\n\n**Concluding remarks:** Very pleasant and affordable. I particularly enjoy the fact that the liquid is not *too* viscous - it stands somewhere in the golden middle, which leaves my skin feeling nice and supple. Its effects have been no where near remarkable, but it is a reliable product for bringing in that extra hydration.\n\n\n\n*Note: I've also posted this in the review section in r/abdiscussion for the audience there. :)*\n",

The mesh setup instead of a cushion looks quite interesting, hopefully means the puff picks up the foundation more evenly\n\nRandom thought: i wish cleansing tissues come in smaller sizes so that it's easier to clean off make up in just the corners of the nose/undereye that have caked/smudged and need touching up.. but that's probably not economical to manufacture XD",

My skin has become a bit \"blocked\" (if that's the right word) while I'm in Japan.\nAt a train station, next to the Curel aqua gel, I saw the BCL Puffy Pod so I thought I'd try it- it had some \"staff recommendation\" stickers (though I couldn't read the actual text which was in Japanese hehe). I wonder how it'll be! It seems very gentle so far. Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow with smoother skin, ready to sweat it up again in this humidity! I was surprised to see only basically 1 English google result about these puffy pods (ratzilla), and this post on Reddit. Thanks!",

I wouldn't say the Milky Gel is *super* waterproof, it's pretty good for humid days but nothing like sports sunscreens, but I do enjoy using this one as it doesn't slide off the face quickly but feels light.\n\n[My full review](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeautyAdvice/comments/c1zy1e/what_did_you_trybuy_this_week_18062019/erm8a12/)",

    "body": "Once again, tagged as a mod post so my account doesn't get any points. This is just reference for you guys! :)\n\nMost hair needs some amount of protein, especially damaged(sun, wind, heat, bleach, etc) hair. Normal hair, or protein sensitive hair does not need large doses of protein all the time. If your hair feels stiff, frizzy, and dry, then your hair might be getting to much protein.  \n\nFor some fine/damaged curlies, protein will make your curls spring to life like never before!! Careful- It can be addicting and turn into a case of \"too much of a good thing\".  Don't worry- if you go overboard on protein treatments, you can just do a good deep conditioning treatment to help counteract the protein overload. :)  So if you have damaged hair that needs protein, how often should you do it?  If it's an INTENSE level of protein, once a week. If it's a conditioner that has some protein in it, every other day or even every day(if it's low enough on the ingredient list) will be fine.  This is why hair porosity is important: Low porosities probably do not need any protein, normal could use some protein, but high porosity LOVES protein. :)\n\nOKAY. Here's the list of commonly used proteins.  Looked for the actual word \"protein\", \"keratin\" or for the word \"hydrolyzed\" to indicate a protein in most cases.\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed casein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed hair keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed rice protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl silk amino acids\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Keratin\n\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed soy protein",

I'm looking forward to testing Missha's in the future. \n\nAnd oh, the Peach Comfort Skin Lotion looks pretty yummy. Plus points for being pretty cheap, too. It would probably work great as a mist. Their hatomugi lotion is probably better for dry skin because of the hydrolyzed royal jelly protein and the exclusion of alcohol, right? While Naturie's will work for oily skin because it contains alcohol for faster absorption. \n\nThank you as always for updating us on new releases!",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI reviewed the **Swanicoco Fermentation Snail Care Emulsion and Toner** on my blog and here is what I think abou them.\n\n**Emulsion**: it's a medium viscosity white emulsion. Once you start rubbing it, it gets watery and feel hydrating. It has a rose tea scent which is quite present (I didn't really like it at first but after a week or so, I started loving it :D ).\n\nMain ingredients are: Licorice Root Water (antioxidant and anti-inflammatory), Aspergillus/Rice Ferment Filtrate (antioxidant, anti-aging), many fermented ingredients (brightening), 5% snail secretion filtrate, hydrolyzed collagen (humectant) and other humectants, emollients.\n\n\n**Toner**: it's a gelified toner with the same rose tea scent as the emulsion. It's hydrating. Typically I apply it directly after washing my face in the morning, eat breakfast and then follow with my routine. And in-between my face doesn't feel dry.\n\nMain ingredients: more or less the same as the emulsion except it also contains a lot of fermented mushrooms! I did some research on mushrooms and some of them seem really promising in terms of skincare! I don't know why they included the mushrooms in the toner and not in the emulsion.\n\nSo both products are pretty amazing in terms of ingredients and they're also a pleasure to use because they have a nice texture, feels great and provide enough moisture and hydration for my normal skin without making it greasy. \n\nLink to my blog post if you want to know more: http://www.nailderella.com/2017/01/swanicoco-fermentation-snail-care.html ",

But the physical store still has the label claiming all the Goku-jyun Alpha products have retinol.\n\nHowever, the [Hada Labo SG website](https://www.hadalabo.com.sg/antiageing-1) only lists **one** product in the Goku-jyun Alpha range as having retinol. I will have to check again to see if the Anti-aging + 3D Gel Moisturiser actually has retinol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have several questions:\n\n1. Why is a different version of the product being sold in Singapore? (If it's because Singapore has tighter restrictions on retinoids, why are other products containing retinyl palmitate sold normally?)\n2. Why are stores selling the Lifting+Firming Lotion (Rich) as having retinol, when it actually doesn't?\n3. Is this incompetence, or intentionally false/misleading marketing?\n4. Are there other regions selling the non-retinol version of the \"red\" range?",

The formula of their eyeshadows are so-so, but workable with a good primer. Come to think of it, the colour story of this new palette is *very* similar to their old one... x) \n\nI'm looking forward to trying Uzu's new lip products! I'm a fan of their glosses as they also moisturise dry lips. \n\nCdP's holiday collections look fantastic as usual, and I hope there will still be some stock left when I get the chance to swing by a counter. D: I'd love to pick up the eyeshadow palette, pressed powder, and a lip product or two. \n\nI picked up DHC's Eyelash Tonic because of the positive reviews. I've been using it for a couple of days now, and I prefer it over plain ol' cold-pressed castor oil because 1) it doesn't break me out and 2) it doesn't give me a headache due to a certain ingredient. I wonder whether Etude House's eyeslash ampoule would be just as good or even better than DHC's... it should be, right? It's twice as expensive, lol. \n\nThank you as always for the update! :D",

The one I got was delayed for a while and then apparently the place I purchased it wouldn't send it by surface mail when it was sent back since it's banned from airmail.  It was a bit frustrating it took 2 months to figure that out, but I'm hoping my latest attempt goes better.  Now there's the Ceramidin mist to consider and winter is coming....",

    "body": "\nI am sure many of you would have seen these products in facebook ads. They are so well shot and fully of \"science\" that it's too difficult to not be influenced into buying these products which are touted as high end skincare. I bought these on Christmas sale some 3 years ago- these are limited edition size. The black friday/ Christmas sales are the only times these products go on sale. The company does not usually discount the off-the rack products but rather brings out limited edition packaging each year which has reduced per ml cost but you spend more as these are sold as bundles. 10/10 for very savvy marketing.\n\nDetails: 35F living in North India, product used during summer months, lasted around 3-4 months. Skin type is oily but no skin concerns except for 1-2 cystic acne per year that leave dark spots. \n\nProducts are serum like, transparent and fragrance free. \n\nProducts used in conjunction with facewash and moisturiser, neither with any actives.\n\nComing to the products themselves:\n\nThe formulae from the website:\n\nHyaluid- Formula\n\nErythritol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Chlorphenesin, Niacinamide, Betaine, Allantoin, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Asiaticoside, Glycerin, Adenosine, Xylitylglucoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Anhydroxylitol, Butylene Glycol, Dextrin, Xylitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Glucose, Pentylene Glycol, Cynanchum Atratum Extract, Sodium Chloride, Madecassoside, Sodium Deoxycholate, Disodium Phosphate, Sodium Phosphate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, sr-(Oligopeptide-91 Clostridium Botulinum Polypeptide-1), Polysorbate 20, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Lecithin, Phosphatidylcholine, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Copper Tripeptide-1 , Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Potassium Hyaluronate, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-2\n\nMarketed as \"comprehensive longevity supplement\", this is a peptide serum along with 8 molecular sizes of hyaluronic acid.\n\nhttps://slurplaboratories.com/products/hyaluid\n\nNiacid\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Hamamelis Virginiana Extract, Pentasodium Tetracarboxymethyl Acetylhydroxyprolyl Dipeptide-12, Pentasodium Tetracarboxymethyl Dipeptide-51, Sodium Hyaluronate, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Brassica Oleracea Capitata Leaf Extract, Sodium Guaiazulene Sulfonate\n\nMarketed as \"universal complexion distillate\", it has galactomyces, niacinamide, snail secretion and tranexamic acid.\n\nMy experience:\n\nThe experience of using them is not distinctly luxurious. The serums feel tacky on my oily skin, as do most other serums. The niacinamide foams as do other niacinamide products on my skin. I have never experienced any visible effects from using any peptide and niacinamide products (my skin is generally in quite good form) but I persist on keeping them in my routine as I understand that they are researched backed for keeping skin looking and feeling nice. \n\nThey have not disclosed % of key ingredients. \n\nI think Korean toners like cosrx snail and galactomyces, purito boosting essence, numbuzin no3 toner can all give similar results as niacid claims. For peptides, the ordinary's peptide serums are good alternatives.\n\nNiacid seems expensive when compared to the other alternatives. Hyaluid may compare to the ordinary's peptide serums in price given that it comes in a 100ml packaging. However, I am not sure if peptides are the stars in Hyaluid given the name focuses on hyaluronic acid. \n\nI loved their glass packaging with minimal design and the company's no bullshit way of operating without frequent sales. They don't even have an insta profile. One might wonder though why there are such limited product reviews on YT. \n\nFinal verdict: undecided on product quality. Too expensive for me to keep repurchasing. WNRP",

I'm listing the prices converted from the retail price in Korea so you can see whether you're outrageously overpaying if you do decide to go look for any of these online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SIDMOOL**\n\nMost products from this brand seem to fragrance-free. They're quite popular in Korea, it looks like. Sensitive skin-friendly, mid-range to very affordable price, good performance/rave reviews. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu73nuoc8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3671e9c6328bb8cab34a24366fac08d06ace645f\n\n1. **Pure Bifida 95 Ampoule - 30ml/24,600 Won ($20.94)**\n\n*Bifida Ferment Lysate, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nBifida ferment is the \"star\" ingredient that makes up most of the famed Estee Lauder night recovery serum if you didn't know (although it matters which strain was used apparently, same with SK-II & their dupes). It's said to strengthen your skin barrier over time and provide very slight, gentle exfoliation. Reviews for this Sidmool serum I have read on the Hwahae app do confirm that many people felt their skin became \"stronger\"/less sensitive. Many also said their skin tone & texture improved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmd5qi5e8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9d487bb091642b6ee3ea1e20e2b1f4cc276b0e4\n\n2. **Skin Sauce D Panthenol Ampoule - 12ml/11,800 Won ($10.04)**\n\n*Water, Panthenol, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root (Chinese Skullcap) Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root (Tree Peony) Extract.*\n\nPanthenol is a great barrier repairing ingredient. Research shows using 5-10% is the best for skin penetration. It's said to be very healing. Note the tiny size, however. 12 ml = 0.4 oz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kc56mwli8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5deb3f6d7af94d6cd14851695dd3a721e599c8\n\n3. **Madagascar Real Moisture Cream - 80g/23,800 Won ($20.26)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica, Glycerin, Hydrogenated lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa (Tree Peony) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Chinese Skullcap) Root Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyl Undecylenate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Erythritol, Sorbitol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Asiatic acid, Astaxanthin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Vaccinium Angustifolium Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Nut Extract, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nThis lightweight gel-cream (Koreans call watery/hydrating creams \"soo boon cream\" meaning \"moisture cream\") is a crowd-pleaser, starring centella and many other soothing ingredients such as Chinese skullcap extract, allantoin, licorice root (the soothing component, not the skin-lightening), and madecassoside. It also has polyglutamic acid, beta-glucan, and hyaluronic acid as humectants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4q3uak8ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0af940dc986ca78892585f4a03d2fd7b23a3b96a\n\n4. **Honey Peptide Moisture Pack - 40ml/9,800 Won ($8.43)**\n\n*Honey Extract(40%), Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract,Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Beta-Glucan, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Trehalose, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Glucosylrutin, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\nA lightweight, gel-textured sleeping pack. This has been #1 for sleeping packs for a while now, too. Reviewers say this is very hydrating. It's absolutely *stuffed full* of humectants: honey, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sugars, beta-glucan, collagen, and peptides. Some soothing ingredients as well, allantoin, licorice root & extracts. Very dry skinned people said it wasn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfr8w5oo8ku31.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdcfdfe41ba52ad5d588187902b7d00420478a4\n\n5. **Calendula Ampoule Moisture Cream - 80ml/16,800 Won ($14.30)**\n\n*Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Calendula Officinalis Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Cholesterol, Glyceryl Stearate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Tumeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Water, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Xanthan Gum, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Heptyl Undecylenate, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\nA gel-cream with skin-soothing calendula flower as the star. Other soothing, anti-inflammatory extracts make an appearance here, as well as ceramides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7f77tcs8ku31.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd7d7db952d0ec115a2a39a569a337f661ac0789\n\n6. **Idebenone Firming Ampoule - 32ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Rosa Canina (Dog-Rose) Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Adenosine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Human Oligopeptide-1, rh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Acetly Hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Ethyhexylglycerin.*\n\nIdebenone is the synthetic version of the powerful antioxidant, CoQ10/ubiquinone. CoQ10 molecules are really big though, so it has trouble penetrating. Idebenone has smaller molecules so it can do the job better. I heard that the patent on idebenone ended recently, so maybe we can see more of this goodie in future products. There are also peptides in this ampoule, as well as some soothing & firming ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdnxp8cu8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72616b051ce0532bd51287099a4e28de9871ec0f\n\n7. **Green Tea Peeling Gel - 120ml/4,800 Won ($4.09)**\n\n*Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water(10%), Glycerin, Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Betaine,Beta-Glucan, Arginine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Allantoin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Carbomer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.*\n\nThis is wildly popular, being so affordable. It's a nice, basic peeling gel. Fragranced with lavender essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cvgwgvv8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b79356fcf60cdd09f5435cd76817e90c5f036c1\n\n8. **Jojoba Lip Essence \\[Original Moisture\\] - 13ml/3,800 Won ($3.23)**\n\n*Polyisobutene, Petrolatum, Diisostearyl Malate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Microcrystalline Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Royal Jelly Extract, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Tocopheryl Acetate*\n\nThis lil' lip balm has been #1 on the Hwahae app for a while now. Which surprises me, personally, as the Korean skincare community is going through a major \"EWG is best source/natural is better\" moment right now. But hey, I guess if it works, it works. Fragranced with orange essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9arxe39ku31.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff34a25e8bccfe68e01a8ccc85e304df7b1b0826\n\n9. **Saccharo Ferment Therapy Essence - 60ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Human Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Water.*\n\nI think some of Missha fermented products use Saccharomyces. Whenever you see a ferment ingredient/whatever extract, that means that plant has been fermented to make the nutrients in it more bioavailable for us. Supposedly the fermentation process releases lots more goodies than just using the extract alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myfq67u59ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfc805f707759f790b86d6dd65460379b6c9674\n\n10. **Saccharo Ferment Sparkle First Ampoule - 100ml/49,000 Won ($41.70)**\n\n*Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nGalactomyces = SK-II, Bifida = Estee Lauder, though which strains are trade secret or something. A very simple ampoule with ferments, a humectant and some plant extracts. They do have a cream version as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0w9k8ta9ku31.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a8cd57bde651c10bf016cd3d6cea4a2799e937\n\n11. **Saccharo Essential Mist - 60ml/18,000 Won ($15.32)**\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Beta-Glucan, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6471tkd9ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5903dcfdcc876d4365879230722e61b4da4c2130\n\n12. **Honey Peptide Mist - 60ml/8,600 Won ($7.32)**\n\n*Honey Extract, Water, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\nA watery, soothing mist with honey, propolis, royal jelly, collagen and peptides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfoo0nzf9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b834384913e4a2a6161fb10bfeed8aeeee4e647\n\n13. **The Calming Essence - 50ml/18,600 Won ($15.83)**\n\nArtemisia Capillaris (Mugwort - Capillary Wormwood) Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Arginine, Cabomer, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol.\n\nA very simple, soothing mugwort, panthenol, allantoin, and licorice root essence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0fj8zdi9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=915ee84ef3cb6c1dec999de951abe84a8b268783\n\n14. **Dr. Troub Bio Repair Powder Cleanser - 60g/15,600 Won ($13.27)**\n\n*Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sobitol, Cellulose Gum, Scutellaria Bicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Artemisia Princeps (Mugwort - Korean Mugwort/Korean Wormwood) Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Human Oligopeptide-1, Acetyl hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Citric Acid, Arbutin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin.*\n\n\\[Second cleanser\\] An SLS-free powder foaming wash. The surfactants in this (Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate & Disodium Lauroyl glutamate) are extremely gentle surfactants often used for cleansers targeted toward babies and sensitive skin. They're more expensive but provide a bunch of non-stripping foam. We see a lot more of these sort of surfactants in recent years because of the bad rep Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate have gotten, which are used widely because of their cheap cost (whether they are gentle or not depends on the formula and what other surfactants they have been mixed with).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8jz1gqk9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1943c1bb896d85a41596a26febcc48e6a47a684\n\n15. **Dr. Troub Skin Returning Cleansing Milk - 200ml/13,600 Won ($11.57)**\n\n*Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Diheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Milk Protein Extract, Allantoin, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n\\[First Cleanser\\] This is a popular cleansing milk that you use like you use an oil cleanser (rub into dry face with dry hands). to remove sunscreen and makeup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w3vw2xp9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0abeef20e0d4ee0787e6101c376d2e70fbb4c3\n\n16. **Galatokside Real Peptide Barrier Moisture Soo Boon Cream - 50ml/29,800 won ($25.36)**\n\n*Copper Tripeptide-1, Glactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Polyglutamic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium PCA, Beta-Glucan, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Adenosine, Arginine, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nA nice, soothing cream with tons of humectants/peptides, and centella components. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3ur5mms9ku31.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480295636783722d34de21a551c16f1fd5a2c4d5\n\n17. **Madagascar Centella Skin - 150ml/14,800 Won ($12.59)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract(97%), Butylene Glycol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nRemember that toners are referred to as \"Skin\" in Korea (Japan = lotion). A simple, calming toner all about centella and soothing licorice and other plant extracts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jittu4x9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c068d9ca9b0ad1830d93a384cfafef950eeebe0c\n\n18. **Eggplant Ampoule - 50ml/22,800 Won ($19.40)**\n\n*Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract**,* *Water**,* *Butylene Glycol**,* *1,2-Hexanediol**,* *Fructose**,* *Sorbitol**,* *Maltitol**,* *Hyaluronic Acid**,* *Sodium Pca**,* *Lupeol**,* *Sodium Hyaluronate**,* *Hydroxyethylcellulose**,* *Sodium Chloride* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6p1j3qf0aku31.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ece7d4d75dea064bfd4febe2f0f610148e9569c\n\n19. **Ferment Care Thermal Mineral Water - 125ml/14,800 Won ($12.60)**\n\n*Onsen-sui, Morus Alba (White Mulberry) Bark Extract, Lactobacillus/Honeysuckle Flower Extract, Cimicifunga Dahurica (Black Cohosh) Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum (Chinese Rhubarb) Root/Stalk Extract, Platycodon Grandiflorus (Balloon Flower) Root Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Extract, Sophora Flavescens (Ku Shen) Root Extract, Rubia Cordifolia (Manjistha) Root Extract, Coptis Japonica (Japanese Gold Thread) Extract, Lithospermum Officinale (European Stoneseed) Extract, Taraxacum Platycarpum (Korean Dandelion) Extract, Pueraria Thunbergiana (Kudzu) Root Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum (Korean Pepper) Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana (Korean Pasque Flower) Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nI like thermal water, idk. I thought there would be more ferments in this, given the name, but I guess not. Thermal water does have a light soothing effect/deposit minerals onto your skin. I thought it was just boring water in a can too, but Labmuffin has a post on it; It's interesting. Korean Pasque Flower is called \"Hal-mi-Kkhot\" meaning \"granny flower\", lol. Because the flower part droops down towards the ground, like how grandmas walk stooped down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqs0h5n2aku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b15d061d15804a54905cf44c73c01d3c8e78da3\n\n20. **Mega Peptide Eco Hydro Soothing Cream - 60ml/28,400 Won ($24.18)**\n\n*Bambusa Vulgaris (Bamboo) Water, Copper Tripeptide-1, Glycerin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic.Capric Triglyceride, Pentapeptide-20, Nicotinoyl Tripeptide-1, sh-Octapeptide-4, sh-Decapeptide-7, sh-Oligopeptide-9, sh-Pentapeptide-19, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Panthenol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Diopyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorce) Root Extract, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Seed Oil, Propolis Extract, Chamomilla Recutica (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Olibanum, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol (Vitamin E).* \n\nSidmool sure loves peptides! This one seems just loaded. Lots of soothing/calming stuff in here as well. Unfortunately, it is fragranced with lavender essential oil, if you are sensitive to that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidmool has loads of other things but my fingers are tired ok.",

When I first got it I patch tested it on my left wrist, the sensation you get is quite painful I guess, depends on how hard you rub it, but I rub pretty hard (not so hard tho) and the pain is maybe like 4-6/10. And immediately after I patch tested it, I can visibly see my left wrist has less texture than my other wrist! And my brightening ampoule from skin1004 gives me wayyyy way better brightening now than before. And also the booster shot absorbs pretty well on my skin ( I have combination skin type)",

There are many introductory resources to how cell-based meat is produced and what its benefits may be, however, there are no comprehensive resources that fully inform those interested in learning more. Below you’ll find the third post in a 6 part series (to be posted each month) that walks through the science driving the innovative technology of cell-based meat. **These posts are intended to be educational but lengthy and best understood by those with science backgrounds.**\n\nIf you haven’t already, please check out the first two Series in the links below. Stay tuned for a new section to be released every month on /r/Futurology. Posts are also formatted for easier reading [here](https://elliot-swartz.squarespace.com/cellbasedmeat/cleanmeat301).\n\n[Series I: Cell Lines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/aoh0c3/indepth_a_comprehensive_series_on_the_science/)\n\n[Series II: Bioprocessing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ayptba/indepth_a_comprehensive_series_on_the_science/)\n\nSeries III: Bioengineering\n\nSeries IV: Cell culture media and regulatory considerations\n\nSeries V: Final products\n\nSeries VI: Impact (environment, human health, food security, animal welfare)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe range of meat products on the market exists on a spectrum of structural sophistication. On one end of the spectrum, there are less sophisticated processed products such as chicken nuggets and sausages; in the middle, ground products; and on the other end, filets and steaks. In order to replicate the more sophisticated products, scientists will need to borrow and improve upon technologies from tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and biomaterials science to recreate the complex multicellular architecture of meat. A review of the core bioengineering biology, scaffolding technologies, and methods to consider for the creation of complex structures are discussed below.\n\n**The Extracellular Matrix and Mechanotransduction**\n\nAs discussed in Series I and II, the initial proliferation of stem cells is an essential part of the cell-based meat production process. How are trillions of stem cells then turned into structured meat via differentiation? In order to understand, background on the extracellular matrix and mechanotransduction is necessary.\n\n*In vivo*, cells exist within a complex matrix of secreted proteins and proteoglycans called the [extracellular matrix (ECM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix). The ECM has an inherent [stiffness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness) that in turn can influence cellular activity via specialized cell membrane proteins called integrins. Integrins act as mechanosensors to mediate downstream effector proteins, leading to the formation of [focal adhesion complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_adhesion) that connect the actomyosin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. The integrin-mediated focal adhesion can be thought of as the midpoint of a tug-of-war between the ECM and a cell’s internal cytoskeleton. These connections collectively mediate a cell’s ability to sense the extracellular environment, leading to downstream signaling that can affect cell polarity, migration, and differentiation.[^(1)](http://jcb.rupress.org/content/215/4/445)^(,)[^(2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25915734) Altogether, this process is referred to as [mechanotransduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanotransduction).\n\nDuring embryogenesis and development, cells multiply and become specialized (i.e. differentiate) in part via cues from their extracellular environment. During this time, ECM components and cells themselves are actively in motion as they pass through key developmental landmarks such as the formation of the [primitive streak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_streak), gastrulation, and tissue specialization.[^(3)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302396) Additional factors such as ECM density and gradients, composition, and 3D topography can have large effects on cell behaviors.[^(4)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19854168) In essence, as cells become defined, their gene expression patterns dictate the creation and secretion of specified ECM components which in turn act as a feedback mechanism to further dictate cellular differentiation and migration, a process referred to as “dynamic reciprocity.”[^(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6892044) Because components of the early embryo are all stem cells, this means that stem cells are exquisitely sensitive to ECM cues. Indeed, the regulation and maintenance of stem cells in the adult body is highly dependent on the ECM components that make up the [stem cell niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-cell_niche), where each tissue’s niche typically contains a unique set of ECM components.[^(6)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081568/)\n\nOver the last two decades, a suite of studies have demonstrated the critical role of the ECM in the regulation of stemness and differentiation across all of the relevant cell types for cell-based meat production: pluripotent stem cells[^(7)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4589090/), mesenchymal stem cells[^(8)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16923388), satellite cells[^(9)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20478295), and adipogenic stem cells.[^(10)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbm.a.35644) By mimicking *in vitro* the ECM stiffness and protein composition of a specified stem cell niche microenvironment, stem cells can be guided into predictable lineages. This biology, together with changes in the cell culture medium composition (discussed in Series IV), will assist in driving the future creation of structured, 3D cell-based meat products.\n\n**Microcarriers**\n\nDuring the proliferation phase, anchorage-dependent stem cells are to be grown in bioreactors at large scales. As discussed in Series II, this non-native environment can lead to [anoikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoikis) if cells are not adapted to suspension growth, grown as spheroids, or otherwise tricked into anchorage independence via small molecules such as Rho Kinase (ROCK) inhibitors. One commonly used method to bypass activation of anoikis is through the use of [microcarriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcarrier). Microcarriers are small bead-like structures typically 100-400µm in diameter that permit attachment of cells via mimicry of ECM characteristics such as stiffness, topography, and porosity (discussed later).[^(11)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4991290/)^(,)[^(12)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776517304630#bib0960) For instance, microcarrier topography can be designed with nooks to prevent shear stress and patterned topography to assist cell alignment and polarity.[^(13)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-018-0020-7) They can be made from a variety of materials such as polysterene, polyacrylamide, glass, or dextran, and these materials are often coated with ECM proteins or charged molecules to assist in cell attachment. Microcarriers are advantageous in bioreactor culture because they provide a large surface area to volume ratio, permitting high densities of cells relative to 2D culture and are able to be used in flexible (e.g. batch, fed-batch, perfusion) and controllable bioprocessing pipelines. Expansion of cells using microcarriers is relatively straightforward, either by the addition of more microcarriers where cells undergo bead-to-bead transfer,[^(14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28470539) or via enzymatic dissociation and passaging of cells to larger vessels via a seed train process.[^(15)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211339813000063)^(,)[^(16)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873506109000208) Furthermore, differentiation can occur on the microcarriers themselves,[^(17)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11094818)^(,)[^(18)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480567) triggered by changes in media components, microcarrier characteristics, or shear forces via mechanotransduction.[^(19)](https://www.intechopen.com/books/cells-and-biomaterials-in-regenerative-medicine/mass-production-of-mesenchymal-stem-cells-impact-of-bioreactor-design-and-flow-conditions-on-prolife) Thus, microcarriers offer immense potential in scaling relevant stem cell populations and for providing differentiated cell types for cell-based meat production by leveraging the bioengineering principals discussed throughout. However, decisions on the use of microcarriers will need to be balanced against the intended product, which may influence strategy surrounding cell proliferation and cell harvesting (discussed in Series V).\n\n**Scaffolding Biomaterials**\n\nIn order to produce structured and thick meat products, cells must be transferred to a scaffold. A scaffold ideally permits the attachment and differentiation of cells in a specified manner, mimicking the 3D cytoarchitecture of meat while allowing for continuous perfusion of media, analogous to the vascularization of real tissue. Therefore, considerations for the porosity of the scaffold, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility are paramount. In some cases, the production of differentiated cells on edible or biodegradable microcarriers[^(20)](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/9752122.html) (or other methods discussed later) may be chosen for inclusion as blended additives in a variety of unstructured products (discussed in Series V). However, fully replacing conventional animal meats will require replication of structured products such as steaks, requiring the skills of tissue engineers, materials science engineers, and other interdisciplinary scientists for building the methods for these applications.\n\nThe biomaterial that makes up a scaffold dictates many of its downstream properties. Biomaterials can be categorized broadly as natural, synthetic, or composite materials consisting of both natural and synthetic materials. Natural biomaterials include those that make up the native vertebrate [ECM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix#Structure), such as fibrin, laminin, hyaluronic acid, gelatin (i.e. hydrolyzed collagen), vitronectin, or ECM mixes such as [Matrigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrigel). Additional natural biomaterials include alginate (from algae), agarose (from seaweed), silk (from spiders)[^(21)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/08/29/403345.full.pdf), chitosan (from crustaceans, yeast, or fungi), cellulose (many plants), decellularized plant or animal tissues (discussed later), and fungal mycelium.[^(22)](https://www.businessinsider.com/mushroom-packaging-startup-aims-for-lab-grown-meat-ecovative-2018-10) These natural biomaterials are generally advantageous in that they have high biocompatibility, high degradability, and low immunogenicity; however, only biomaterials derived from vertebrate ECM are functionalized via native cell adhesion motifs. While growing cells on biomaterials such as alginate or chitosan is possible, they lack recognition motifs that promote cell adhesion and migration, limiting their functionality. These cell recognition motifs include the Arg-Gly-Asp ([RGD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGD_motif)) and Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV[^(23)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5075/05d98fad501b32f5eba851c2d17ed496e374.pdf)) motifs, amongst others less commonly used, derived from corresponding amino acid sequences in fibronectin and laminin, respectively.[^(24)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875) Integrins on the cell surface serve as the binding receptors for these motifs, mediating cell attachment and downstream signaling.[^(25)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11884718) Many strategies exist that permit functionalization of non-RGD-containing biomaterials, either by mixing with other functional biomaterials such as gelatin,[^(26)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5744339/) chemical [crosslinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link) with RGD peptides,[^(27)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876107012001265) or genetically engineering the RGD motif directly into a biomaterial.[^(28)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706115301392)^(,)[^(29)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26461118) Surface functionalization methods such as [ion beam deposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_beam_deposition) or plasma treatment can also be used to create favorable surface properties such as hydrophilicity.[^(30)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128027349000214) Alternatively, synthetic biomaterials can be used. Synthetic biomaterials permit high tunability for a variety of desired biophysical properties, making them attractive for tissue engineering purposes.[^(31)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19472329)^(,)[^(32)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206299/) Some common examples of synthetic biomaterials include Pluronic, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), and poly(acrylamide).[^(33)](https://www.nature.com/articles/natrevmats201512) However, because these materials do not support cell adhesion, they also need to be functionalized as previously described, and are commonly combined with other natural polymers to form a composite material.\n\n**Hydrogels**\n\nAlthough purified ECM proteins can be used to coat substrates for 2D cell growth, the use of a single protein component in 3D culture often results in a lack of desirable attributes such as mechanical properties, mesh network size, and degradation.[^(34)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5800304/) Thus, a large effort has been dedicated to controlling these characteristics, discussed below, by creating composite hydrogels composed of synthetic and natural biomaterials.\n\nThe vast majority of applied biomaterial use in tissue engineering comes in the form of a hydrogel. A hydrogel is a 3D network of polymer chains that can readily absorb water (up to 1000x their dry weight) due to their hydrophilic properties. They can be engineered to swell or de-swell in response to various external stimuli (e.g. temperature, light, pH, electric field), and tuned for incorporation of a variety of macromolecules.[^(35)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875)^(,)[^(36)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123213000969) Because of their aqueous makeup, hydrogels naturally have high permeability for oxygen and permit the flow of water-soluble molecules, exquisitely mimicking soft tissues of the body.\n\nA hydrogel’s mechanical properties are frequently measured with [atomic force microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy) to reveal the [Young’s modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus) value, which defines the material stiffness in relation to stress and strain. *In vivo*, the Young’s modulus of different tissue types is variable and this helps to determine cell fate via mechanotransduction. For instance, adipose tissue and the brain are soft (\\~0.2 - 1.0 kPa), skeletal muscle is intermediate (\\~10 kPa), and bone is hard (\\~30-45 kPa) tissue.  Thus, recapitulating these stiffnesses within a scaffold can direct the differentiation of stem cells. For instance, the growth of mesenchymal stem cells on soft or hard hydrogels can bias their fate into fat or bone, respectively.[^(37)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16923388)^(,)[^(38)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531177) Similarly, muscle satellite cells can self-renew when grown in a substrate that matches the stiffness of their native stem cell niche.[^(39)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12195-017-0506-7)^(,)[^(40)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2929271/)  Tuning of the stiffness can be achieved by increased [crosslinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link), addition of carbon nanotubes[^(41)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22117858), graphene[^(42)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11359-x), DNA[^(43)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/02/21/556381.full.pdf), or modification of natural or synthetic polymer materials with photo-crosslinkable side groups. Importantly, these photo-crosslinkable groups permit fast polymerization, allowing encapsulation of cells during a process such as bioprinting (discussed later). Cell-based meat scaffolds may thus be constructed with various composite polymer materials that dictate stiffness in a pre-patterned spatial orientation to replicate the fat, muscle, and connective tissue architecture found in a desired meat product. Indeed, studies have demonstrated the biasing of stem cell fates to bone and fat via stiffness properties within a single hydrogel.[^(44)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17286-1)\n\nAlthough hydrogels can mimic soft tissues, they are limited in scale. The creation of thick tissues that permit diffusion of oxygen and transport of nutrients and waste in an analogous manner to vascularized tissue *in vivo* has been challenging and is an active area of research. In general, a scaffold used for transplantation contains pores that permit neovascularization of the tissue once in the body.[^(45)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20939827) However, a scaffold for cell-based meat may aim to support cell viability via perfusion within a bioreactor (discussed later) rather than *in situ* vascularization, as the current state of technology is just beginning to understand how to create vascular tissue from stem cells.[^(46)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0858-8) This means that a scaffold’s mesh network of pores should ideally be interconnected and distributed such that cells can infiltrate the scaffold and lie within 200µm of nutrient access, as this is the upper limit for the mass transfer of oxygen.[^(47)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961205004734?via%3Dihub) Other parameters such as pore shape, volume, and roughness also need to be considered.[^(48)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963751/) Ideally, the recapitulation of the ECM should happen on the scale of the structural ECM components themselves (i.e. 50 - 500nm diameter),[^(49)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17916396) while the porosity of the scaffold should be on the micrometer scale to permit cell invasion and migration. This general principle has been challenging to mimic; however,  sophisticated techniques for fabricating large hydrogel scaffolds with these properties are coming of age (discussed later). Lastly, given that a tissue created for consumption does not need to be functional inside of a body, a scaffold designed to be less densely populated may be easier to achieve. Once populated, the structure could be compressed at harvesting or further structured into a final product (discussed in Series V).\n\nCareful design considerations have been made in tissue engineering to utilize non-immunogenic, biodegradable materials with biologically inert by-products (as they are intended to be inserted into the body for regenerative medicine purposes).[^(50)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905875) Likewise, a scaffold that biodegrades into inert by-products would be desirable for cell-based meat not only to avoid non-edible materials being incorporated into a final product but also by allowing the cells to replace the hydrogel scaffold with their own native ECM. Indeed, hydrogels are typically static substrates that alone fail to dynamically recapitulate the spatiotemporal interactions between a cell and the ECM. One method to overcome this is by incorporating proteolytically degradable crosslinks,[^(51)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3633615/)^(,)[^(52)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20667588) which permit naturally secreted enzymes such as [matrix metalloproteinases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase) to degrade the hydrogel substrate, permitting cell migration and establishment of dynamic reciprocity previously mentioned. A suite of other methods such as photodegradable polymers[^(53)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19342581) and unique chemistries permitting light-mediated crosslinking[^(54)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531177) have also been developed by bioengineers, enabling more accurate recapitulation of ECM-cell dynamics.\n\nBioengineers also attempt to mimic other characteristics of the ECM such as regulated diffusion of soluble secreted signals. *In vivo*, ECM molecules such as [heparan sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparan_sulfate) proteoglycans can bind and sequester growth factors that regulate local cell migration and differentiation. Some hydrogels such as Matrigel, derived from mouse tumor cells, contain these embedded growth factors, albeit in variable quantities and unknown spatial distributions. Techniques such as incorporation of proteins containing photocleavable linkers or photocaged peptides[^(55)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S100184171830202X) permit precise and sometimes reversible spatiotemporal release of sequestered factors via light. However, it’s unclear how feasible these methods would be for cell-based meat production at scale. Rather, covalent tethering of specific growth factors within the hydrogel scaffold,[^(56)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444702/) spatially distributed to mimic the cytoarchitecture of meat, may be able to assist in attachment or guidance of precursor stem cells into their correct location within the scaffold or toward downstream terminally differentiated cell fates.\n\nMany of the natural polymers that can be used as scaffolds are also edible to humans, with several already approved by the FDA for use in food (regulation may differ by region). Thus, edible polymer materials in microcarriers or scaffolds for cell-based meat development are likely to be pursued in order to avoid removing cells from the scaffold (discussed in Series V) or rigorous demonstration of safety for human consumption, as would be needed with some other material types. Research in this direction using [edible scaffolds](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetforgrieve/2019/02/27/seaweed-sorghum-and-cell-behavior-projects-win-gfi-grants/#712a29f21394) for cell-based meat[ has already begun](https://www.gfi.org/researchgrants). Examples of FDA-approved edible biomaterials include pectin,[^(57)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813012002759?via%3Dihub) gellan gum,[^(58)](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2009/jm/b818090c#!divAbstract) chitosan, gelatin, cellulose, and alginate, amongst others.[^(59)](https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/3/3/27/pdf) Some synthetic polymers such as PEGs are also FDA-approved. As previously mentioned, the majority of these polymers lack functional domains for cell adhesion; however, they can be functionalized with RGD peptides or combined with functional edible components such as gelatin.[^(60)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5744339/) Importantly, these scaffolds also tend to be affordable and scalable in terms of the raw material components, with scale limitations mainly determined by method of fabrication (discussed later). Some companies have independently demonstrated the [large scale production of proteins such as collagen](http://www.geltor.com/) using recombinant yeast or bacteria, and this may serve as a future platform for the creation of biomaterial sidestreams used for the cell-based meat industry. Lastly, many of these biomaterials have also been used for tissue engineering of bone[^(61)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24999429), which may be applicable for cell-based meat if bone-in products are ever pursued.\n\n**How are scaffolds made?**\n\nThe quest to build human organs from scratch has led to the development of an array of technologies and methods for the reconstruction of complex tissues. In general, two approaches can be considered for biofabrication of a complex tissue: top-down and bottom-up. In top-down approaches, as generally described above, a scaffold is fabricated and cells are seeded onto the scaffold; however, these approaches generally struggle to recapitulate tissue microstructure.[^(62)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826124/) Alternatively, bottom-up approaches aim to create modular biostructures on the microscale that can be assembled into larger, more complex tissue types. Advances in 3D printing now permit combinatorial approaches of both efforts.[^(63)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-018-0006-y)^(,)[^(64)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961218308639) At the heart of each method is a concern for issues previously discussed: biomaterial selection, biocompatibility, porosity, etc. The emerging technologies that best handle these issues and those that are most likely to be explored for use in cell-based meat scaffold development such as 3D bioprinting, electrospinning, decellularization, and other considerations, will be discussed in the next section.\n\n**About / Disclosure**\n\nElliot Swartz, Ph.D. ([/u/e\\_swartz](https://www.reddit.com/u/e_swartz)) is the author and is employed by [The Good Food Institute](http://www.gfi.org/), a 501(c)3 nonprofit that serves as a think-tank and accelerator for the plant-based and cell-based meat fields.\n\nFeel free to ask anything about the science discussed or how to get more involved in the future of food.

Your posts provide great insights, and I'm curious about what would look like a large scale cultured meat production system. \n\nThe thing is that I've some troubles deriving the annual cultured meat output from a total bioreactor capacity. \n\nIn one [medium post](https://medium.com/@josiah.zayner/cultured-meat-will-not-be-realistic-anytime-soon-the-numbers-behind-the-hype-77b64d580996), I've found this :  *\"Now,  this warehouse has a max output of 28,000L, let’s imagine they run it  flawlessly at our overinflated production numbers from above of 10g / L  of cells and a new culture every 10 days.

Let's imagine a  factory has a 400,000L capacity (if I get it, it's possible with the right number of perfusion stirred tanks bioreactors of a 2000L capacity). Could this factory produce  only around 400,000 pounds of cultured meat annually ? \n\nMore generally, how do you derive the annual cultured meat output from the total bioreactor capacity ? What assumptions would you make (10-day production process ? What about losses during the process ?)\n\nI'd like to do (on my free time, besides starting a cultured meat promoting NGO) a design study for a large scale cultured meat facility (about the same size that the current biggest bio-pharmaceutical plant), but this limits me.",

I used their conditioner as well, and for a while, it made my hair nice and soft.  \n\nThen all of a sudden, my hair started to get extremely dry and tangled all the time. I am talking self dread locking, small animal around the nape of my neck tangled.  I first chalked it up to being winter and my jacket/scarf being the culprit, but as we moved into and through summer, same problem.\n\nI started changing conditioners, trying different ones, but nothing seemed to help.  I tried protien treatments and that seemed to help. Then I realized, it was not the protien treatment that was helping but the aphogee shampoo for damaged hair which had SLS in it. \n\n I have been experimenting with this theory and it appears that whenever I shampoo with the aphogee and my regular conditioner its fine.  If I use the SLS free shampoos I have, tangled, dry mess. I am thinking that the more natural shampoos just dont cut it (literally), I think there is junk left on my hair, which means that the moisture from my conditioner isn't penetrating in there and also that junk likes to stick to junk, causing tangling.\n\nIs there any rhyme to my reason or am I totally off base here? Is there another ingredient that may be causing this?\n\nApogee ingredients: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Oleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Glycol Distearate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Lecithin, Polyquaternium-10, Hydrolyzed Whole Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Cocyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Butyl Stearate, Oleoyl Sarcosinate, Sesame Oil, Lanolin Alcohol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylparaben, FD&C Red #40.\n\n\nSY2C Shampoo ingredients: Water (Aqua), Lauryl Glucoside, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Juice, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Maris Aqua, Maris Limus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil*, Calendula Officinalis Seed Oil, Cucurbita Pepo (Pumpkin) Fruit Extract, Ipomoea Batatas Root Lees Extract, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Honey Extract, Punica Granatum Extract, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate \n\nSY2C conditioner ingredients: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Citrus Grandis Fruit (Grapefruit) Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil*, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Extract, Maris Water (Sea Water), Maris Limus (Sea Silt) Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum). *Certified Organic Ingredient",

I’m getting over all the new products coming out that are simply plant extracts with no actual well known effective goodies in them, and being super expensive. I’ve noticed in particular an alarming (for me) amount of new products coming out with no niacinamide in the ingredient list. I remember some old products targeted towards brightening the skin containing arbutin, now nearly all the new ones contain some ridiculous plant extract instead (vitamin tree, some sort of citrus, white flowers...)",

Mermaid](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=1&classid=11) and [Fashion Traveler](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=1&classid=23) mask collections really caught

you are a fan of placenta they are def worth a look.From what I've seen the majority of their products are fragrance free and don't have any EO or fragrant plant extracts(their anti-aging line(the with brown packaging) does have some flower and citrus extracts)). They products have ingredients such as placenta extract, ubiquinone,dif froms of HA, ceramides, hydrolyzed collagen, royal jelly extract, phytosphingosine,  Neosolue™-Aqulio, retinyl palmitate, tripeptide F, oil soluble licorice extract, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate,etc.\n\n\n\nAlso I checked this out yesterday for someone  and even thought they made a post about it afterwards in case you guys haven't seen it the Rosette Ceramide Gel has been discontinued.According to [cosme](http://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/289770/top) - \"This product has ended production or renewal. (However, some stores may still be on sale.)\" . From what I could get from some comments the gel has stopped production this april while the lotions from the line have stopped been produced since last fall.The entire Ceramide line is gone from the lineup on the Rosette's site.",

I don't like having things around, and I don't even know that I'd like a floral scent, but I still look at them every now and again since they're so cute.  :/\n\nI love the Bring Green packaging as well - you can tell I've spent time on Olive Young's site.  I don't need any of it, but I do like to look at it every now and then.\n\nI'm happy Aromatica has a new line.  Everything I've tried from them, with the exception of a hair oil that I dislike the smell of and a physical sunscreen, has been pretty good.  The cica-panthenol oil from their new line seems interesting as does the glow sleeping mask - it's also less than 1/2 the price of the one I was going to use if my current sleeping mask ever runs out.  So that's something to consider.  :)",

    "body": "I've noticed a lot of gals coming here asking for help with their hair, and many of them have common hair ailments. I decided to put this guide together as a good stepping-stone to improving the condition of your hair, especially if you're on a budget. This is by no means a comprehensive, be-all-end-all guide to healthy hair, and I'm open to additions, revisions, and suggestions. Hopefully with enough collaboration we can put this on the sidebar!\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am *not* a stylist and I can't say I have any \"formal\" hair training -- this is just from my own hair exploration over the past 2 and a half years. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYour hair is...\n\n---\n\n**Frizzy**\n\nUsually caused by a rapid loss in moisture in the hair shaft. Consider adding a *humectant* to your styling products. \n\n* Glycerin\n* Honey\n* Agave nectar\n* Hydrolyzed collagen/silk/keratin\n\nNote: these are to be used in moderation -- too much can leave your hair feeling stiff and possibly even sticky. It's definitely a good idea to add a little bit of one of the above ingredients to an existing styling product that isn't quite doing the trick for your frizzy tresses. I add honey to my leave-in conditioner, and it works magic. \n\n---\n\n**Dry**\n\nHair can't seem to hold on to moisture even with a bucket of conditioner dumped over your head? Does your hair feel mushy and straw-like even when wet? It could be caused by having porous hair. In this case I usually suggest a protein treatment. \n\nYou can concoct a home-made hair treatment using any of the following: \n\n* Eggs\n* Yogurt (whole, not low-fat)\n* Mayonnaise (careful, as it can be very oily)\n* Gelatin (mix with boiling water, stir, and let cool)\n\nMy personal favorite recipe is avocado, yogurt, and a little bit of jojoba oil. Mix them evenly, and add conditioner (you can use a cheap, silicone-free conditioner like Suave Naturals) if you need to make more of the mixture. Apply to damp hair and then comb it through. It works wonderfully. \n\nYou can also buy protein treatments. I swear by [aphogee's 2-step protein treatment](http://www.aphogee.com/Two-Step-Treatment.aspx). Some people think it smells weird. I've heard great things about [K-Pak reconstructor](http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/itemid=17887) as well. \n\nUsually, after one does a protein treatment, they need to follow up with moisture to bring softness and bounce back to the hair. You can either leave your regular conditioner in for a few minutes longer than usual and rinse with cool water, or you can go all out and make yourself a nice moisture treatment with any of the following: \n\n* Avocado\n* Coconut oil\n* Olive oil (*very* sparingly!)\n* Aloe vera\n* Jojoba oil\n* Shea butter\n\n---\n\n**Dull**\n\nNeed a shine boost? Yogurt will help you out here as well! You can also mix 1 part water and 1 part apple cider vinegar and pour it over your head as a rinse after shampooing. (Don't shampoo? Read the next section!)\n\nOften my hair becomes dull when it just doesn't have enough moisture. For a mid-day refresher, mix 3/4 water and 1/4 conditioner into a handy spray bottle and do a quick spritz to bring life back to curls and add shine. \n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou have... \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Scalp Buildup**\n\nSometimes when I'm scrubbing my scalp, I notice a general gunkiness to my scalp. A common remedy for this is baking soda! Simply mix the baking soda with water, until it forms a paste-like consistency, and massage it through your scalp in gentle circular motions. This is also a great alternative to using a harsh clarifying shampoo, as it cleanses the hair and removes buildup. \n\n---\n\n**Split Ends**\n\nThe obvious choice here is, unfortunately, a good 1/4\" trim every 6-12 weeks. For those of us on a quest to grow out our hair, that might not be the very best option. To immediately reduce breakage, do a protein treatment from above followed by a good dose of moisture. To keep the splitting down, you can also keep your hair in protective styles like braids and twists. \n\n--- \n\n**Flat hair**\n\nDon't have a lot of volume? Consider flipping that pretty head of yours over when you're blowdrying and gently using your fingers to lift your roots away from your scalp as you blowdry. If you don't normally blow-dry your hair, you can get some [Alligator clips](http://www.hair-hardware.com/alligator-clips/) to hold your roots up as your hair dries.\n\n---\n\n**Too much volume!**\n\nThis seems to happen to gals of the curly persuasion. The first step in eliminating the dreaded christmas-tree look is a good haircut. You can't layer curls the same way as straight hair but unfortunately many stylists just comb you straight and snip away. It's totally worth it to find a stylist in your area that specializes in curls. \n\n[NaturallyCurly](http://www.naturallycurly.com/) has some great resources including a Salon Finder and the Forums (be sure to cross-check any salon you find on the forums. I made the mistake of not doing so and ended up with a rude hairdresser who didn't know squat and had written positive reviews about herself!)\n\nAnother thing to avoid too much volume is **DON'T** brush your hair once you get out of the shower. Wet your hair, put conditioner in it, and gently comb through starting at the ends. Wet hair is very very delicate, but this step will pay off when your hair hugs itself in glorious happiness.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Recipes**\n\n[A list of some really good recipes](http://pedaheh.blogspot.com/p/science-y-hair-blog-recipes.html)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell, I hope you guys enjoyed my giant wall of text. Thanks for letting me get up on my soap box. \n\n&hearts;",

    "body": "Just a small review on a new little happy hitter in my pile! A few months ago I was buying some cream on iHerb and needed something to fill space for free shipping. At the time Coxir was on sale so I got it for $12.16. It had snail and that was enough to be a target. I kind of considered the brand to be a Cosrx knockoff, which it very well may be, or just have super similar packaging. But I absolutely did not take the purchase seriously and it sat on my shelf for a while. \n\nAbout a month ago I opened it and gave it a try. I’ve used it on and off since then, never quite committing until recently. Here’s what changed and what I think about the product!\n\nWhat changed: on a lark I decided to smear half my face with Coxir and the other half with Missha’s Misa Cho Gong Jin Toner (bigger review for later). I was shocked by how the Coxir immediately dimmed the redness on its side. It was very visible. It soaked in and bam: calmer skin. I have mild rosacea so calm skin is my battle. Calm skin in summer is like a war. \n\nUsing it more and for me, it’s just a really nice product. It’s thin but thickened enough that it’s not so watery it flows off your hand immediately. You can easily layer it. It doesn’t feel heavy on my skin; it’s barely noticeable. I really enjoy the scent which is very powder fresh to my nose. It’s just a nice simple easy to layer non-offensive toner (for me). I didn’t even look at the ingredients until now but they’re nice: (and kudos to Coxir for having them easily available on their website)\n\nSnail Secretion Filtrate, Water, Betula Alba Juice, Butylene glycol, Methyl Gluceth-20, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycoproteins, Betaine, Glycerin, Yeast Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Black Soybean Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Adenosine, Copper Tripeptide-1, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Parfum\n\nA lot of stuff I quite like and gravitate to normally. Because of this I’m going to be checking out some of their other stuff in the future. The Black Snail Collagen line has a few products and this has been more visibly valuable than several centella focused products I’ve used over my AB journey.",

The essence i very fresh and hydrating. Packed with hydrolyzed collagen and baobab oil to make the skin plump and \"young\" looking.

And by best I mean...Peach & Lily/Peach Slices.\n\nI have had such amazing luck with their sheet mask offerings and I have been holding onto these Peach Slices Peace Popsicle Sheet Masks for months and months...waiting for a special occasion lol!\n\nEach of the Peach popsicle Masks focuses on a specific benefit/”flavor” including Pomegranate Protect + Nourish, Mango Hydrate + Glow, and Pineapple Clarify + Calm.\n\nSome of the main selling points for me about previous sheet masks I used from Peach Slices (Aqua Glow Sheet Masks) were the unique formulations for each mask and a general focus on results driven formulations. The Peach Popsicle Sheet Masks continue with that trend.\n\nIngredients such as Pomegranate, Mango, and Pineapple Extract are found here (of course)...but other things like Centella Asiatica, Willow Bark Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Kiwi Fruit Extract, and Calendula Flower Extract make their way into the formulations as well.\n\nThe mask material here is a super classic cotton style sheet mask that is comfortable and cooling once applied. I found the material to sit well...but not have that “silkiness” that I have been loving from some Taiwanese masks (23.5n Rice Soothing Mask...amazing!). \n\nEach mask delivered on its claims...offering mild brightening, calming, and nourishing benefits. The pomegranate version includes BHA and my skin was left with a slight smoothness that surprised and impressed me. With the mango...I appreciated the boost of dewyness and slight plumping effect (from the intense hydration).\n\nBut, I'd have to say that my favorite overall was the pineapple “flavor”. While this mask is missing classic calming ingredients like centella asiatica or chamomile...it overall formula left my skin looking less red/irritated. There was also a brightening effect that I appreciated.\n\nDon’t let the fun packaging fool you...these sheet masks are packed with hydration and calming no matter which one you pick. The Peach Slices Peace Popsicle Sheet Masks are a fun and effective treat to my routine and something I would totally come back to! \n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily $3.49 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/collections/peach-slices](https://www.peachandlily.com/collections/peach-slices) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qddj4txcfj51.jpg?width=5130&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ba570f14daebbb85413b9a10a3ad52d2c1362e5",

    "body": "Less Appreciated Home Shopping Brands \n\nWhen people think about the Korean beauty products, they always put road shop brands first. Yes, I agree – Missha, The Face Shop and Nature Republic – they are amazing brands with excellent quality and reasonable price at the same time. But it is not all about Korean beauty. As I spotlighted in my last posting,  (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4mtpgm/less_appreciated_korean_luxury_brands/)  there are luxury brands. However, the most unknown territory of Korean beauty is home-shopping brands. Even though home shopping cosmetic brands are less known to the Korean beauty fans in US or other part of the world, they create some trend in Korea. Genic made hydrogel mask so popular and now it occupies half of the shelves in mask sheet section. The first & the most famous cushion foundation – IOPE Cushion - also got its fame form the broadcasted home shopping. Generally the quality of home shopping brands has pretty decent.in Korea, the home shopping channel has batch system. So if the customers do not re-order, they will be removed from the home shopping channel without mercy. So, this time I brought some “probably” less known Korean home shopping brands.\n\nA.H.C – Hyundai Home Shopping  \n\nProbably, you already know about A.H.C because of their triple hyaluronic acid mask sheet or hydra soother mask.  However in Korean home shopping channel – GS Home Shopping, A.H.C’s best seller is “The Real Eye Cream for Face.” Well, it surely does sound weird but it contains lots of beneficial ingredients such as N.M.F (15% count), snail filtrate, ceramide complex and peptide complex. As they claim it is an eye cream (or maybe facial cream…???,) it has a very rich and eye-cream like texture but don’t worry, it absorbs really quick. The 89,000 KRW package ($79) package contains 10 of 30ml cream, 3 of 12ml travel sized sample and 100ml ampoule. (generally, this is how Korean home shopping cosmetics are packaged.) \n\nAge 20’s – GS Home Shopping \n\nAge twenties is a relatively new brand in the market. But Age 20’s uses middle age celebrity Kyeon Mi-ri and her daughter as a model and quickly become major player in the home shopping cosmetic market. Age 20’s main focus is on “Age Cover Pact.” Its iconic triple latte art foundation (three colored melting foundation with bage, pink and sparkling white mix) is infused with hydrolyzed collagen and other essence ingredients. They recorded 33 consecutive batch sold out. Now GS Home shopping sells Age 20’s foundation package (2 pacts, 3 refills, 1 serum, 1 cream and 3 lip tints) for 68,900 KRW ($61). It is super creamy and quite moisturizing. If you have chance, try them out, especially if you have dry skin. \n\nVerite – CJ Mall \n\nVerite is a sub-brand of Amore Pacific (so Verite is a sister brand of sulwhasoo or IOPE). Somehow Verite is the least known brand outside of Korea but their UV multi cushion LX is pretty popular in home shopping channels. It is a sweat-proof cushion pact and has micro hyaluronic acid powder, so it covers imperfections very well but at the same time, it moisturizes your skin very well. In CJ home shopping sell Verite’s UV multi cushion package ( 2 pacts, 4 refills, one cream and 2 skincare essence) for 76000 KRV ($67.)\n\nElensilia – NS Home Shopping\n\nElensilia is a quite famous brand for its snail cream (80%). Most of us are familiar with snail filtrate or snail cream, but Elensilia’s snail cream is a bit different from snail creams from other brands. They focus on glycosaminoglycan. It is a mucopolysaccharides, normally obtained from snail mucin rather than  x\tblindly increase the contents of snail filterate. Interestingly, they have close relationship with well known French cosmetic ingredient company “Sederma,” so they obtain most of their active ingredient from them. This cream is watery gel textured but moisturized my skin very well. Elensilia has other high potency lines (bio intense line with 90% galactomyces / CPP line with 80% caviar extract or 80% placenta) as well, generally packaged with snail cream. \n",

After having an unfortunate breakout from the Biore Perfect Face Milk (SO SAD because it felt wonderful, it was probably the alcohol that got me), I was looking for a way to calm my skin. Spotted the Dermal sheet mask at an H-Mart in my neighbourhood, saw it was packed with aloe and bamboo which just sounds nice and soothing, and contained no alcohol. \n\nAfter using it, my skin was just... ridiculously calm. I just injected it into my regular routine, so it's the only thing that I think could have caused the change. I've been using them pretty frequently for the past two weeks and my skin is just constantly improving, it's honestly amazing. I'm assuming it's the anti-inflammatory properties of aloe and bamboo? Regardless of what it is, it's blowing my mind. My forehead's texture hasn't looked this good in ages.\n\nMy skin isn't perfect yet, but this is a HUGE step in the right direction, I feel awesome when I wake up and see my skin looking a bit better every day. And if anyone has any similar or better sheet mask recommendations, I am all ears :)\n\nEdit: Apologies for the apostrophe in the title :| too excited to grammar.\n\nEdit: Ingredients List!:Water, glycerin, butylene glycol, bambusa vulgaris leaf/stem extract, hydrolyzed collagen, aloe barbadensis leaf/juice, portulaca olerscea extract, beta-glucan, panthenol, tocopheryl acetate, poly-sorbate 80, disodium edta, xanthan gum, methylparaben, fragrance",

    "body": "I wrote up this piece on collagen supplementation because it's a super commonly asked question of vegans. I was curious what might help or benefit people who are interested in taking collagen supplementation, how necessary they are, etc. and what a vegan alternative is. I don't intend on this being an academic paper and it's out of my field of study so please forgive if I use some terminology wrong. I think the research is sound and fully understandable, though.\n\n### Introduction\n\nCollagen is a specific protein found in most animals, and is the most abundant protein in the human body, forming the bulk of our connective tissue (skin, bones, joints, ligaments; collectively referred to as the extracellular matrix). Proteins themselves are not actually fundamental biological material, however — all proteins found in all organisms are actually formed up of smaller constituent pieces called *amino acids*. When you eat anything containing any form of protein, including collagen or collagen supplements, your digestive system breaks the protein up into either isolated amino acids, dipeptides (combinations of 2 amino acids), or tripeptides (combinations of 3 amino acids) which are then absorbed by the body to be used for whatever purposes the body needs them for. [1] https://med.libretexts.org/Courses/American_Public_University/APUS%3A_An_Introduction_to_Nutrition_(Byerley)/APUS%3A_An_Introduction_to_Nutrition_1st_Edition/05%3A_Proteins/5.04%3A_Protein_Digestion_Absorption_and_Metabolism\n\nThere are 21 different amino acids which are the building blocks of all proteins (Sometimes you might read 20, because seleocysteine is counted separately; other times you might read 22 because of pyrrolysine which isn’t found in humans — the specific number isn’t all that important). Of these, we group them into three categories: 1) essential, meaning that we must eat them in our diet; 2) conditionally essential, meaning that our bodies can usually synthesize them ourselves but certain circumstances prohibit that (e.g. in babies who aren’t fully developed yet for protein synthesis, or certain illnesses); and 3) dispensable, meaning that our bodies will synthesize enough of them on our own.\n\nFor what it’s worth, the categorization is a bit loose, or at least doesn’t tell the whole picture that a lay person should be concerned with — these are strictly categorizations that are useful for biologists. The nonessential amino acids are formed by breaking down other amino acids, which means that while a diet devoid of all of the nonessential amino acids would require considerably more of the essential amino acids, plus the additional energy expenditure to convert them to other forms. As I’ll get into later, glycine is a nonessential amino acid, but if you take a bunch of it in in your diet, your body doesn’t have to go through the process of converting a different amino acid into glycine first, which might have some benefits (more on this later).\n\nThe above is basically just a summary of wikipedia to get us all on the basic level of how protein works. Understanding amino acids and protein and stuff is basically an entire textbook’s worth of knowledge. But this should be enough to let us dig a bit into the specifics on protein and collagen.\n\n### How does dietary protein work?\n\n[2] https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/77/4/197/5307079\n\nThis review article is focused primarily on the environmental impacts of plants vs. animals but in order to get there they present a phenomenally excellent overview into how dietary protein works. Figure 1 in particular examines a variety of different foods, as well as animal bodies and secretions, and their amino acid profile. The table shows essentially given an amount of protein from each of these specific foods, what the amino acid breakdown is. Remember — regardless of how you source your protein, they are all broken down into amino acids in the stomach; once an amino acid gets into your bloodstream from your digestive system, your body doesn’t know nor care where that amino acid came from.\n\nFigure 1 from this article clearly shows that there is no amino acid found uniquely in animal foods over plant foods.\n\nCollagen specifically is made up of only 19 amino acids. When you take a collagen supplement, your body digests the collagen protein and turns it into its constituent amino acids, just like any other protein source that you eat — it is essentially protein powder but it’s actually lacking in the amino acids cysteine and seleocysteine. The typical structure of collagen is considered to be about 1/3 glycine and 1/6 proline + hydroxyproline (the latter is a derivative of the first), the rest is a mix of all the other amino acids except for cysteine.\n\nBack to Citation 2, for the most part so long as sufficient protein is consumed in a day (as it nearly always is — even by vegans, contrary to popular belief), you will also get enough of each amino acid. The concept of “protein quality” and “limiting amino acids” is important only for situations of food scarcity.\n\nLet’s use an analogy, say you’re running a bakery: imagine that you are requested to bake 10 cakes in a day. So long as you have enough of each ingredient to make 10 cakes, you’ll be able to make all 10 — it doesn’t matter if you have tons of extra flour at the end but used up your last bit of oil with the last cake. You still made all 10 cakes. Protein requirements act in a moderately analogous way — your genetics “request” certain amounts of certain proteins, your production cells assemble the proteins from the amino acids. If your last protein synthesis of the day uses up your last bit of lysine, it only matters insofar as you’re going to need to eat more lysine tomorrow in order to meet your body’s demands.\n\nAs the author explains, “There are 3 conditions that would need to be met simultaneously in order to create a need to complement plant-based proteins: total protein intake for the day was low (ie, close to an individual’s protein requirement); very little dietary variety was available or chosen; and no animal proteins were consumed, as in a vegan diet.” Just to really drive this home: take methionine which is the limiting protein in beans. Given the reported data, per gram of bean protein, about 1% of it is methionine. According to this report ([3] https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/84/5/1080/4649322), you need about 7.3mg of methionine per kilogram of body weight per day. I’m just about 50 kg, so my daily requirement is roughly 365mg of methionine per day (7.3 mg/kg/d multiplied by 50kg). Since in 1g of bean protein, about 10 mg of it is methionine (1%), if I eat at least 36.5g of bean protein per day, I meet my methionine requirement and am no longer concerned about limiting amino acids. *(The real picture is quite a bit more complicated than this, and there are obviously other nutrients needed as well as the fact that in a pure mono-food diet different amino acids might be the limit. Also meeting the only minimum requirements doesn’t mean you’re at an optimum level of health. This was just an example for demonstration. Please eat a varied diet).*\n\nThe tl;dr of this section is, you’re getting enough of each essential amino acid from a plant based diet for your body’s needs so long as you’re eating enough protein in general. Collagen supplements are just (fairly poor quality) protein powders that are lacking in one of the dispensable/nonessential amino acids (cysteine).\n\n### How does collagen generation work?\n\nI’m not going to be able to really properly answer this question because it’s still such an open scientific question! Skincare companies would love to figure out The One True Method of increasing collagen production in the skin so they can sell it to us for beautification; same for pharmaceutical companies in general for selling cures for various joint disorders and to promote joint health. But, at least the overview of the process is well understood: back to Wikipedia for this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen\n\nBasically, your body has cells called fibroblasts which produce collagen by piecing together certain amino acids, doing some chemical reaction on some of the lysine and proline acids with vitamin C to turn them into hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline, shipping the resulting protein outside of the cell, where it is then modified by some enzymes, strung together, and then stuck into its final destination where it acts as structure for the body.\n\nLet’s go back to the bakery analogy. You want to make as many cakes as possible (your brain deciding you want more collagen for your skin or joints or whatever). There’s a number of potential limiting factors in this. 1. Do you have sufficient amounts of the ingredients for the recipe (i.e. enough of the right amino acids and vitamin C)? 2. Do you have enough chefs in the kitchen (i.e. enough cells that produce collagen)? 3. Are the chefs you *do* have working hard enough? (This is all hypothetical, I know you’re not capitalist scum). 4. Do you have a large enough customer base to actually buy the cakes (i.e. does your genetic expression lead to more collagen generation), or can you increase this through means like advertising (i.e. modulate this genetic expression through chemical means, including whether or not having a glut of the necessary amino acids results in more collagen formation).\n\nWhen it comes to collagen supplementation though, only question 1 and part of question 4 matter: do you have the raw materials to produce collagen, and does having an excess of collagen materials result in an increase in collagen synthesis?\n\n(For what it’s worth, the research out there for questions 2 and 3 are extremely fascinating, but much more inconclusive; furthermore there are certainly risks in trying to promote cell division and activity. I’d say one consistent feature of the research is to make sure you wear sunscreen to prevent fibroblast UV damage among other issues, which can reduce collagen synthesis).\n\n[4] https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bharat-Kwatra/publication/341132150_COLLAGEN_SUPPLEMENTATION_THERAPY_FOR_SKIN_DISORDERS_A_REVIEW/links/5eb041fb299bf18b9594bc1a/COLLAGEN-SUPPLEMENTATION-THERAPY-FOR-SKIN-DISORDERS-A-REVIEW.pdf\n\nThis is one of the better and more systematic reviews out there in a well regarded journal. According to their reviews of the data,\n\n> Thus, there was an abundance of pre-clinical and clinical reports that provide evidence for collagen hydrolysates supplementation, which supports the enhancement and/or improvement of dermal health via oral administration and via nutritional products.\n\n[5] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jocd.13435?casa_token=9EbTH0iLZgsAAAAA%3A2fnRctFHVIzxzwTeuXUPTKlhAtgLtisdg5L-We7CtnvqBTFZjGfECTYMwPUXTKBdg_pvHBN59f4gFA\n\n> The evidences obtained from these systematic reviews indicated that oral administration of intact or hydrolyzed collagen improves clinical manifestation of skin health. Almost all of the included studies reported the beneficial effects of collagen supplementation, and no inconsistencies have been seen in this regard between studies.\n\nOkay cool, case closed, right? Supplementation of collagen seems like it has measurable effects over taking a placebo.\n\nI was a bit surprised to have read this, actually, as my understanding was that it shouldn’t matter *where* you source your proteins from, only that you have enough proteins. However, if you dig into these studies a bit deeper, there’s a few simple questions that I think can be asked. 1. What was the placebo? If you supplement 5g of collagen but the control group is taking 5g of sugar pills, it kind of makes sense that the group that got 5 additional grams of protein might have better skin outcomes (especially given that it’s also well known that refined sugar has a deleterious effect on skin collagen). 2. Do they analyze the actual mechanism by which collagen supplementation actually improves skin?\n\nThe answer to question 1 is generally that the placebo was sugar pills. I’m not going to disregard the entire systematic reviews based only on this, as a few grams of additional protein isn’t that significant, however I think it’s worth mentioning. For question 2, however, I did find some interesting articles that might shed some light.\n\nMy own intuition was that, since collagen is primarily glycine, that it could simply be that collagen supplementation could be providing benefit through this avenue — especially if glycine is in some way the limiting factor in collagen genesis.\n\n[6] https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12038-009-0100-9.pdf\n\nSure enough, it seems that this is well supported in the literature — Your body’s synthesis of glycine can be inadequate, dietary intake of glycine is relatively low all the time, adding in additional glycine to your diet should clear up that weak link.\n\nTable 3 is particularly telling on the human glycine requirements for various purposes — column g specifically is the authors’ estimation on the required amount of dietary plus synthesized glycine in order to meet regeneration requirements of the skin, skeleton, cartilage, etc.; per the data gathered by the author the average human is getting a substantial fraction less than required for all of these processes.\n\n> It is clear that even though the true need cannot be estimated with any precision, it must amount to several grams and there are no grounds for believing that the supply of glycine is adequate to meet the demand for collagen. Thus, the response of the organism to the deficit will involve a decrease in protein turnover.\n\nTable 4 is also a summary of the work overall, with an estimated glycine deficiency of -8.5 to -10 grams per day. Naturally these specific numbers are averages based on experimental data and calculation, not measured for you specifically — no need to start taking 10g of glycine supplementation per day, and quite a bit more waits to be seen.\n\n[7] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00726-017-2490-6\n\nThis is a rough article to read as it’s about “optimizing” the growth of “livestock” animals; animal studies are also tough to extrapolate to humans. However they essentially come to the same conclusion — dietary intake of glycine is nowhere near as much as the body wants to use for all of its processes.\n\n[8] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6153947/\n\nHere’s an in-vitro study coming to the same conclusion:\n\n> Since the large effects produced by proline and lysine are within the physiological range, while the effect of glycine corresponds to a much higher range, these results demonstrated a severe glycine deficiency for collagen synthesis. Thus, increasing glycine in the diet may well be a strategy for helping cartilage regeneration by enhancing collagen synthesis\n\nThere are countless other animal studies as well as in-vitro studies on glycine supplementation, and I don’t want to get into the weeds with those due to my beliefs on animal testing, however they can be found pretty readily and often open access on scholarly search engines.\n\nThere are no broad review articles on glycine supplementation as of yet. However, nearly all collagen supplementation review articles that I read do dedicate a few words to glycine, citing that collagen is rich in glycine and that this fact is likely is a major contributor to the efficacy of collagen supplements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt’s hard to say for sure, but it seems that glycine supplementation may be an effective stand-in for collagen supplementation.\n\nLet me go back to my bakery analogy. You’ve received an order for 10 cakes that absolutely must be met at any cost, and then an order for up to an additional 100 cakes that you’d love to make — as many of these 100 cakes as you can deliver, the customers would be glad to have. You start making cakes, and find out that you have plenty more than enough of all the ingredients, except for flour, the most abundant ingredient required for all your cakes. That is to say — your customers (your skin, bones, etc.) want a bunch of extra cakes (collagen), but your bakery (fibroblasts) don’t have enough flour (glycine) to make them all.\n\nYou have two options here: 1. you can go get a bunch of baking mixes, that include every ingredient for a cake — including the ones you already have more than enough of (aka, take a collagen supplement). Or 2. you can just go buy additional flour by itself and make the 100 cakes with that plus the rest of the ingredients that you have lying around (aka, take a glycine supplement).\n\nIn [7], the authors do state:\n\n> non-essential amino acids such as glycine and aspartic acid do not significantly penetrate the blood–brain barrier (Baños et al. 1975; Davson 1976). Furthermore, Directive 67/548/EEC of the European Union describes glycine as ‘not hazardous’, as it does not become toxic in rats when taken orally until a gigantic dose of 8 g/kg is reached, corresponding to around 600 g in a human.\n\nI am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice.",

    "body": "Hey! I keep seeing questions about collagen, so I wanted to make a quick summary as a guide for folks.\n\n# WHAT IS COLLAGEN?\n\nCollagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, accounting for about one-third of its protein composition. It is a key structural component of connective tissues, such as skin, cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments. Collagen provides strength, elasticity, and hydration, playing a vital role in maintaining the integrity and function of these tissues.\n\n# HOW DOES COLLAGEN SUPPLEMENTATION AFFECT THE BODY? DOES IT WORK?\n\n* **Improve Skin Elasticity and Hydration**: Studies have shown that collagen supplementation can improve skin elasticity, hydration, and reduce wrinkles.\n* **Support Joint Health**: Collagen supplements can reduce joint pain and improve symptoms of osteoarthritis. Randomized controlled trials have shown that collagen supplements can reduce joint pain and improve mobility in people with osteoarthritis and athletes.\n* **Enhance Bone Health**: Collagen may help in maintaining bone density and reducing the risk of bone disorders such as osteoporosis. Collagen supplementation has been linked to increased bone mineral density and a reduced risk of fractures in postmenopausal women.\n* **Aid Muscle Mass and Strength**: Collagen supplements, in combination with resistance training, can increase muscle mass and strength in elderly individuals.\n\n# WHAT ARE THE BEST SOURCES OF COLLAGEN?\n\n* **Hydrolyzed Collagen (Collagen Peptides)**: These are the most commonly used form due to their high bioavailability and easy absorption. Mostly marine and bovine sources.\n* **Gelatin & Bone Broth**: Derived from collagen, gelatin and bone broth are less processed and can be used dietarily, though they are less readily absorbed than hydrolyzed collagen.\n* **Vegan Options:** Vegan options are a bit limited. You can buy many collagen boosters that contain the building blocks for collagen (amino acids, vit c etc) however, they often don't perform as well. One notable exception, is VeCollal® which has compared quite well to marine collagen in clinical studies looking at it's impact on skin health.\n\n# WHAT ARE THE BEST COLLAGEN PRODUCTS FOR _______?\n\n* **For Skin Health**: Verisol® and VeCollal® perform the best for skin.\n* **For Joint Health**: Fortigel® and BioCell Collagen® perform the best for joints. Tendoforte® can help specifically with tendons and ligaments.\n* **For Bone Health**: Fortibone® performs the best for bone.\n* **For Muscle Mass**: Any collagen.\n* **For All In One Support**: Fortsil® and Peptan® are generalists and have shown in studies to help across multiple areas.\n\n\\*\\* *I personally take Whole Body Collagen by Designs for Health which includes Verisol®, Fortigel® , and Fortibone®.*\n\n# ARE THERE ANY RISKS OR SIDE EFFECTS?\n\nCollagen supplements are generally considered safe for most people. However, potential risks and side effects include:\n\n* **Allergic Reactions**: Some individuals may experience allergic reactions to collagen sourced from specific animals.\n* **Digestive Issues**: Some people may experience mild digestive issues such as bloating or diarrhea.\n* **Contaminants**: Ensure that collagen supplements are sourced from reputable brands to avoid contaminants such as heavy metals and toxins.\n\n\\*\\* *Consulting with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen is always recommended, especially for individuals with preexisting health conditions or those taking other medications.*\n\n# References\n\n1. **Proksch, E., Schunck, M., Zague, V., Segger, D., Degwert, J., & Oesser, S.

I like the concept of lip tints but they haven't really worked for me as my lips are forever dry regardless of hydration or treatment. \n\nI have mixed feelings about holiday and seasonal collections.   I understand that different shades work for different seasons,  but brands should have a decent shade selection available at all times.   It also creates a false sense of scarcity that tricks people into thinking they need to be buying new makeup at all times to squeeze money out of us while we never finish a product.

    "body": "Tldr: When my hair is unstyled (and no products) it curls more the dirtier it gets. When styled it can look great but the curls go more and more limp over the following days. What does my hair really need?\n\nI would love some wisdome from this awesome sub! I have very fine hair, would say medium density, can't figure out my porosity. Probably mixed with higher in the top layer and ends. It is not colored, bleached or heat styled at all. But I'm sure I have some mechanical damage from years of tying my hair back in a messy bun 95% of the time, plus no sleep protection ever. I have never really cared very much for my curls. Did co-washing/no poo for many years until about 2-3 months ago when I started trying to actually try and bring out my curls more. \n\nWhat I'm generally struggling with is that my hair seems to VERY easily get over conditioned. It becomes crazy soft and the curls fall limp. It mosly shows when I'm trying to refresh my curls, it always looks way worse thank before no matter how I do it. I've tried different products but this seems to be happening with most of them, and it's gotten me thinking...\n\nSo a few days ago I decided to give my hair a break from everything. I clarified, used a tiny bit of very simple rinse out conditioner (it has very few ingredients, only one conditioning agent, probably like no moisture). I diffused a little bit and let it air dry. It had no definition whatsoever, it was so poofy, frizzy and weightless, it felt like it almost levitated. Except for the lowest layer of my hair, mostly around my neck, that forms tight ringlets no matter what (love those little guys always doing their best!). On day 3 after washing it started getting a little bit more dirty and oily and also started curling a little more (1st picture). And I wonder how I should interpret that? I have been convinced that my hair is not dry and needs minimal moisture. We have soft water, which I think is an important factor. But maybe that's wrong, maybe my hair needs more moisture? Can it be soft and shiny and still dry? Can it be over conditioned and still dry? Would I do well with some kind of oil to lock in moisture? For example: my curls LOVE high humity. Or do I need more minerals because of the soft water? This is really where I need some help and wisdome! 🙏\n\nMy routine (although it varies a bit):\n- Wash every 3-ish days, with clarifying shampoo (sometimes shampoo with sulfate, sometimes a clarifying shampoo without) or low poo.\n- Condition and detangle with tiny amount of rinse out light conditioner. I often mix in some hydrolyzed collagen, I have found my hair does better with some protein.\n- Style with a little mousse at the roots for volume, homemade flaxseed gel and sometimes a little hairspray. As little as possible of everything to not over condition and weigh down. Diffuse to fully(-ish) dry, then scrunch out the crunch.\n\nMore info: we have naturally soft water at our house (no softening system). I live in northern Europe so the outside conditions vary a lot. \n\nFirst picture is my slightly dirty unstyled, no product hair beginning to curl a bit more, second picture is my hair looking its best when styled.\n\nSometimes I think that maybe I should just be happy that I can get my hair to where it is in the second picture, but something about all of this is bugging me. Like it has been so much stronger in it's ability to hold a curl, but that I'm now somehow making it more difficult for it to do its thing. A looming feeling that I'm not really giving my hair what it needs to do its thing best, basically.",

        "body": "This sounds a lot like my hair (which also seems to like protein). It has a very delicate balance where it needs enough conditioning to hold a shape but not so much that it gets weighed down or too silky/soft. If you washed your hair without conditioner you’re probably seeing it find that sweet spot on its own after a couple of days. I imagine your soft water is probably adding to this effect - I know everyone says hard water is terrible for your hair, but idk I think for hair that is softer or finer textured, a little bit of “grit” can be desirable. I’m still trying to figure out what works best, but I wash it frequently (every other day is what works for me, or just whenever it starts to look or feel a bit weighed down at the roots) and I don’t necessarily use a shampoo specifically for clarifying because I wash my hair often enough and don’t use a ton of product. I don’t specifically look for or avoid sulfates but I guess maybe the stuff I use can qualify as “low poo”? I like to use conditioner before shampoo so I don’t have to worry about it weighing my hair down, but at least once or twice a week I shampoo and condition in the normal order so my ends are not accumulating too much buildup. Also, instead of an actual “refresh” I just shower normally and let the top layer of my hair get a little wet, and maybe add some more hair gel. but I have harder water than you so I don’t know if that will work as well for soft water - you might actually want to try a texturizing spray or homemade sea salt spray to refresh your hair… if you do give this a try let me know how it goes  \n\nIf protein seems to be working well for your hair don’t be afraid to experiment with other products that contain it! People talk about “protein overload” but that’s really just a type of product buildup that you can wash away with a clarifying shampoo.",

    "body": "• There aren’t that many reviews of products by Bonajour online so I decided to make a review post. All of the products were purchased from Amazon through the official Bonajour seller. \n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\n1.) Coconut Oil Body Moisturizer (300 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Olivate, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Saussurea Involucrata Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Olivoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Glyceryl Oleate, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Arginine, Carbomer, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n- Review: I’ve repurchased this body lotion multiple times already. The scent is so heavenly and it feels so good on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight but moisturizing. 5/5\n\n2.) Sensitive Skin Body Wash (500 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Disodium cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Propanediol, Sodium cocoyl glutamate, Sodium chloride, Glycerin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aniba Rosodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Octyldodecanol, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene glycol\n\n- Review: I love this body wash, I’ve purchased it 2 times and it lasts for a while too (even with daily use). It has a relaxing smell and it lathers well. I put this body wash on a Salux washcloth and the body wash doesn’t dry out my skin. 5/5\n\n3.) Mugwort Cream Calming Mask (1.9 fl. oz)\n\n- Ingredients: Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract(32.20%), Water, Kaolin, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bentonite, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery)Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Brassica Rapa (Turnip) Leaf Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Brassica OleraceaItalica (Broccoli) Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pusatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Citrusparadisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Octyldodecanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Oleanolic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (4,000ppm), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil(500ppm), Sod\n\n- Review: I’m still going through my first purchase of this and it’s grown on me. Although I prefer the I’m From Mugwort Mask, this mask is skin calming too. I use mask this during my menstruation cycle (where my skin is more prone to having skin inflammation) and it felt very nice. I also like how the date when opened can be written on the product + it’s a cheaper mugwort product. 4/5\n\n4.) Propolis Serum (100 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Propolis Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Ulmus Campestris (Elm) Bark Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Gleditsia Australis Thorn Extract, Angelica Dahurica Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Bletilla Striata Root Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Extract, Trichosanthes Kirilowii Root Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Amomum Xanthioides Seed Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Sodium Carbomer, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Epigallocatechin Gallate\n\n- Review: I have mixed thoughts about this product. The price is really good especially for the size (100 ML). I would recommend this serum for oily skin types. This is more of a skin calming serum rather than a hydrating one. It did calm my face but did little for my acne. This product is also unscented. I didn’t repurchase the serum. 3/5 \n\n5.) Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

I can't tell from the description if there's a physical attachment device, or if the mask will just stick as sheet masks do.  The tab on the forehead part is a bit confusing to me though, since that will make people's hair goopy.\n\nIt looks like it has fragrance at the bottom of the list, I wonder if it means old lady fragrance since it's an anti-aging mask?  I have so many questions.  If I found it in a local shop I'd probably grab one to see what it was all about.  :)",

    "body": "So, some weeks back, I got a Velvizo “starter kit” on eBay, consisting of [4 sheet masks + double samples of 3 more products]( http://i.imgur.com/cuwjuh3.jpg): ampoule, sunscreen and BB cream, and, based on the notes on my blog, have written up a veritable novel of my impressions.\n\nIt’s clearly not a popular brand outside of Korea, there’s nothing on CosDNA, and while the [Velvizo website](http://velvizo.com/shop/main/index.php) appears very informative, it is in Korean only (I’ll link though, because the product pages have plenty of visual info). I still don’t know much about the ingredients in any of the things I tried. I did do a site-wide search for what Google Translate says is “tea tree oil” in Korean, a.k.a. my main allergy trigger, and there were no matches. As for where to get their stuff, in addition to that one eBay seller who mostly has masks, there’s a decent selection on TesterKorea. Velvizo’s most popular product overall seems to be the Marine Magic Cleansing Water (I get the impression it’s a 2 in 1 cleanser), but the samples I got are also all popular, according to the sales rankings on their homepage. \n\nAlso: I’ve got dry/combo skin, reside in a cold, damp seaside climate and am in my late (gulp) thirties.  \n\n\nStarting with the sheet masks!\n\n[Velvizo Marine Spa Vital Mask: Control Soothing]( http://velvizo.com/shop/goods/goods_view.php?goodsno=152&category=010) (blue package). According to the package, “Hypo-allergenic mask acts highly effective for soothing and rejuvenating skin and makes your skin healthy and lively,” and “helps to calm and relax sensitive skin with the effect of qualified and soothing ingredients” – main ingredients seem to be purified water, aloe vera, witch hazel, chamomile extract and hyaluronic acid. It is also, like all the other masks, “4-free”, which seems to mean, free of parabens, colourants, mineral oil, and benzophenones. (As far as I could tell, all the masks were also alcohol-free.)\n\nThe fit could be better – there are eye flaps, which I always find odd, and then the eye holes themselves are a bit too close together for me (nothing a quick snip with scissors couldn’t improve though), and while it almost covers my huge forehead and also covers my small chin just fine, it doesn’t cover all of my jawline. There’s also not much stretch to the cotton mask material. It feels heavier than average - in fact all 4 masks are the thick, rich-feeling kind -, and is a bit stiff, but also holds a lot of essence (without noticeable dripping, I hate drippy masks), and takes a while to even start drying (recommended use is 20-30 minutes, I think this could easily do 40). There is also quite a bit of extra essence (package weight is 25 g). The essence is somewhat sticky, but feels nice and cool on skin, no burning or tingling. It smells slightly of chamomile. As for effects, my face certainly felt good, and looked well hydrated, plump and happy immediately after + looked and felt soothed and good on the next day.   \n\n**Verdict**: solid product, will consider repurchasing.\n\n\n[Velvizo Marine Spa Vital Mask: Radiance Intensive]( http://velvizo.com/shop/goods/goods_view.php?goodsno=150&category=010) (purple package). It says “Having concentrated triple effects, brightening skin tone, high moisturizing and revitalizing the aged points,” and on the back, “Highly concentrated with 3 essential active ingredients – Hyaluronic acid, EGF, Adenosine and Arbutin give brilliant skin and effectively keep moisture and nutrients on your skin by thick pure cotton Micro Moisture Cell of the mask. Hypo-allergenic mask acts highly effective against wrinkles and intensive treatment for elasticity of your skin.” [sic here and onwards]\n\nThis is their most expensive mask (also the heaviest at 29 g). The mask sheet itself is, I think, the thickest one I’ve ever tried, but the cut is the same, with eye flaps and eye holes a bit too close together. But more importantly, there is a pretty distinctive smell. Quite off-putting at first tbh. Something along the lines of grandma’s medicine cabinet – herbal, medicinal, slightly acidic, old. (Side note, the website seems to hint this mask has something to do with the Marine Intensive Ampoule, but the samples of that smelled completely different and much, *much* better! And the texture wasn't as sticky, I don't believe they are the same thing.) It didn’t linger when I patch tested though, so I gave it a go. The essence was yellowish and thick/gooey, no dripping, again plenty left over in the package too. For some reason, this is suggested only for 10-20 minutes? I did 30ish though, and felt moisturized, if a bit sticky afterwards. There was no immediate radiance to speak of, only the SFs on my nose seemed extra visible somehow (urgh). HOWEVER, the next day I woke up with the angriest, deepest zit of a decade on my cheek, where I seriously never get any, + a few more minor ones on my forehead. OTL\n\n**Verdict**: I’m conflicted about the purple mask. I get the feeling that even if this seemed to act as an acne fertilizer for me, and smelled pretty bad, this might be right up someone else’s alley? If they’re into heavy-duty, medicinal-feeling products? And, y’know, ignoring the angry zit bits, gotta admit the rest of my face looked ~fine~. Still, I can’t see myself repurchasing.\n\n\n[Velvizo Marine Spa Vital Mask: Real Brightening]( http://velvizo.com/shop/goods/goods_view.php?goodsno=155&category=010) (white package). What it says: “Helps to care dull skin and gradually restore it to the purified skin condition”, “Containing effective ingredients Niacinamide, Grapefruit extract, Houttuynia Cordata extract make your dark skin clean and transparent. Hypo-allergenic mask in pure cotton helps to remove skin troubles and makes your skin shine and brilliant.” Vaguely scary-sounding, this one. The homepage also mentions papaya extract and proline as ingredients. \n\nThe mask itself is in a different texture once again, and while the cut issues are the same as with the blue and purple, this sheet is thick and extra soft, full of milky, gooey essence that does not drip at all. It had the faintest hint of sweet bubblegum smell upon opening (seriously thought this one had no fragrance whatsoever when patch testing). Feels ~good~ on, soothing and lovely. The recommended use is 10-20 minutes, and it seemed to be drying a bit faster than the previous ones. It’s still 25 g though, and there was extra essence I used the next day.\n\nI daresay my face did look brighter, as in, less red/pink, once I took it off (not as drastic as the homepage pictures though, no visible mask outline). But over the next 2-3 days, not only were there no surprise zits (yay!), it seemed that my skin looked brighter, more porcelain-y. Especially with wearing make-up, I kept noticing that I look as if someone had replaced the bathroom light bulb to 20% stronger. *Luminous*, yo. \n\n**Verdict**: Reader, I ordered 8 more post-haste.\n\n\n[Velvizo Marine Spa Vital Mask: Lifting Renewal]( http://velvizo.com/shop/goods/goods_view.php?goodsno=154&category=010) (the green one). What it says: “Helps to replenish the moisturizing and nutrition into the skin deeply.” And on the back, “Specially formulated Hydrolyzed Collagen, EGF, Adenosine, Acetyl HexaPeptide-8, polyphenol complex deeply care your skin. Hypo-allergenic cellulose mask gives elasticity and firming effect on your skin and makes it younger and silky.” The advertised effects I can find are: “elastic supply, lifting effect, superior hydration”. They also point out it is free from silicone, artificial flavors (fragrance?), mineral oil, and parabens, and that the main ingredients are adenosine, human oligopeptide-1, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed collagen and acetyl hexapeptide-8. \n\nThe green one is also a 25 g package, but it’s more expensive than the blue and white. The essence is clear, only a little yellowish, and it had a mild, slightly sour smell when I first opened the package. (again, I could not tell there was any smell to it when patch testing, it’s that mild.) There is some extra essence, but most of it was absorbed into the luxurious-feeling, soft, fluffy mask sheet (no dripping!). And the sheet is their best one yet! It’s a different cut: the eye holes are not too close together, and there are no fold-down “eye flaps” that all the other three had. It felt remarkably nice on, a good fit. Also, the extra essence I put on my neck and chest was not particularly sticky, which is a plus. I really enjoyed this one. The recommended use is 20-30 min, it easily lasts that too. After removing, my face felt super-drenched in moisture in a good, refreshed kind of way. Felt and looked good the next day as well, if not quite as dramatically brightened as with the white one.\n\n**Verdict**: Definitely want more – it’s the last one I tried just a couple of days ago, or I’d have bought some already.\n\n\nOnto the samples now:\n\n[Velvizo Marine Multiaction Collagen BB cream]( http://velvizo.com/shop/goods/goods_view.php?goodsno=66&category=010) SPF 30, PA++\n\nThis was a bit of hit and miss for me. The tone match was pretty good (I’m quite pale with a cool undertone, maybe NC10 or 15?), but I didn’t really grasp just how heavy-duty the coverage is, while patch testing it on my arm, so when I first tried it on my face, I started out with way too much, and was spreading it with my fingers. Not a great idea, as I’ve had concealers, never mind foundations with less coverage than this, and ended up caked in base make-up. Next time used much less, but applying with fingers was still not ideal, because it’s just that pigmented and heavy. Then moved on to applying with damp sponge (Missha hydro egg) + concealer brush, and that worked much, much better: got coverage that was ultra-fine, almost airbrush quality, and it lasted pretty well with setting powder, only moving a bit on my nose, once it got oily in some hours. My forehead and cheeks felt a bit dry though. And overall, I felt more heavily made up than usual and a bit self-conscious about it.\n\nThe biggest lesson for me: holy ****, this stuff will not budge without cleansing oil. And I didn’t even realize before I needed to wash the sponges & brush (was oil-cleansing my face to take it off anyway). Soap and water alone made very little difference, the stains would only dissolve in oil. Idk if this is normal for Korean base make-up, but constantly double-cleansing brushes and sponges seems like too much hassle for me. Think I’ll stick with my ArtDeco concealer+Bourjois compact for base.\n\n**Verdict**: I think it’s a decent product (and there are tons of 5-star reviews on the homepage), but it’s not for me.\n\n\n[Velvizo Marine Spa Regenerating Ampoule]( http://velvizo.com/shop/goods/goods_view.php?goodsno=13&category=010)\n\nEven though I was quite happy with the stash overall, [this clear yellowish goo]( http://i.imgur.com/Im1A0IP.jpg) was my favourite of the things I tried. The package says it “provides the over-stressed skin with high moisturizing and comforting effects over time.” TesterKorea has some info on the ingredients, noting that it has EGF, coenzyme Q10 and betaine, as well as arbutin, ubiquinone, adenosine, Morus Alba root extract, Laminaria Digitata extract and Undaria Pinnatifida extract (the last 2 are types of seaweed). I suppose Velvizo’s signature ingredient, something seaweed-derived called Fucoidan, is also in there. What isn’t in there: mineral oil, parabens, artificial colourants or fragrances (at least that’s what I think they mean when they say flavours). It also has loads of 5-star user reviews on the homepage.\n\nThe touted effects include improvements in elasticity, skin nutrition, skin tone and a moist, glossy look. TesterKorea says it’ll give you firmer, fairer and younger-looking skin, and makes tired-looking skin radiant and firm. Overall, quite a lot of promises there. The thing is, based on the 2 samples, I was sufficiently impressed to order the full size. My face just looked and felt *that good* when using this. Even the few zits and blemishes I had developed a few days before, and made worse by picking at them, seemed to heal up kind of fast.  \n\nIt smells very slightly like bubble gum or marshmallows – a sweet smell that fades too fast for me to make up my mind. Easy to spread, not excessively gooey, but not too runny either, sinks in fast, leaves no trace behind, no stickiness. It’s not ostentatious in any way, but delivers a noticeable feel-good factor nevertheless. Crucially, I just felt happy to apply it every single time.\n\n**Verdict**: I ordered it. It’s too expensive for me to use consistently (it’s $25 + shipping, and 30 ml won’t last me much more than a month), but I would happily use it as a splurge product a couple of times per year.\n\n\n[Velvizo Marine Whitening UV Sun Cream]( http://velvizo.com/shop/goods/goods_view.php?goodsno=3&category=010), SPF 50+, PA+++.\n\n[The sample and the product look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/DRRlPLR.jpg) As it says on the package, “As perfect sun protection cream, it helps to balance out skin tone even and moisturized.” This, too, has predominantly 5-star reviews on their homepage. And once more, TesterKorea is more useful in finding out at least some of the ingredients: arbutin, Portulaca Oleracea extract, Macadamia seed oil, and “fine pink pearl powder”; and it’s free from parabens, mineral oil and benzophenone. TK advertise it thusly: “Dual functional cream brightens skin tone with fine pink pearl powder and whitening composition. The sunscreening level of SPF50+, PA+++ also protects skin from both UVA and UVB and harmful substances while gently providing moisture.” In short, it’s a multitasking product: ultra-high protection sunscreen that doubles as an illuminating make-up primer, and also moisturizes and brightens. \n\nIt does have a slight, pale pinkish, very fine shimmer, particularly in electric light, [here’s how a patch shows up on my hand]( http://imgur.com/3c6NwnE). I don’t see a white cast though, and am inclined to think the sunscreen in it is either completely or predominantly chemical. Smells kind of like sweet bubble gum again, and it’s a bit more persistent this time. It’s not oily at all, nor sticky, but I will say that my face looked shiny af with it on, every tiniest textural issue highlighted. Thus I would not wear it on its own. However, concealer, etc., go on like a dream on top of this, and last well too. I’m quite impressed with the primer factor, and my skin appears to be ok with the formula. There's not much to dislike here.\n\n**Verdict**: I’m sold on how well the primer/sunscreen combo works and intend to buy this.\n\nAnd that's it so far. I am also intrigued by Velvizo creams, but have plenty of good creams in my stash right now, and they're a bit pricy for impulse-buying, so additional tests will have to wait. Also, if you actually made it this far, thank you for reading!",

    "body": "I wanted to make a post as I recently had my wisdom teeth taken out. They were horizontal and one side was impacted, with massive inflammation.\n\nI do a lot of biohacking and neurochemistry research, so I looked into supplements that may help recovery. Not expecting much, I started my regimen but when I went back a week later, my ortho was very impressed by the fast healing. He said he's never seen a recovery as quick as this, and asked what I had done. I explained to him the supplements I took, then sent over all the research.\n\nIf anyone is interested, these are evidence backed supplements that have been shown to accelerate recovery time and reduce post-extraction complications. Now some of these studies didn't use oral supplements as I did, some were topical, and also had some specific use-cases, but the science was clear and they were still effective in my case.\n\nOf course, review with your orthodontist/doctor before taking anything.\n\n**Vitamin C: 600mg - 1000mg daily (Split dosing throughout the day)**\n\n* **International Journal of Dentistry (2022):** 600mg/day vitamin C showed 57.3% wound closure versus 48.3% placebo (p=0.036) and significantly reduced pain scores in extraction patients.\n* **Systematic Review (2022):** Meta-analysis confirmed 600mg/day reduces wound size at 1 week post-extraction (57% vs 48%) and accelerates healing across multiple studies.\n\n**Zinc: 40mg lozenges pre-op, then every 6 hours × 72 hours (OR 50mg daily as I took orally)**\n\n* **Clinical Study (2023):** 40mg zinc lozenges pre-operatively, then every 6 hours for 72 hours significantly reduced pain, swelling, and trismus post-extraction.\n* **Wound Repair & Regeneration (2007):** Clinical evidence showed 3-4x faster surgical wound healing with oral zinc supplementation in multiple patient populations.\n* **NOTE:** High dose zinc should only be taken short term, as it can cause a copper deficiency otherwise.\n\n**Collagen: 10-15g/day oral + topical collagen sponges (I only took oral)**\n\n* **Split-Mouth RCT (2020):** Absorbable collagen sponge insertion after impacted third molar extraction showed significantly lower pain scores at 1 week (1.42 ± 1.26 vs control, P < 0.05).\n* **Collagen vs Xenograft Study (2023):** Split-mouth trial in 13 patients showed collagen side had significantly faster wound closure across buccolingual axis (P = 0.045) and lower pain scores on day 5 (P = 0.004).\n* **Ridge Preservation Study (2017):** Collagen sponge group showed better ridge width preservation and improved gingival thickness compared to collagen matrix in 28 patients.\n* **Marine Collagen Research (2022):** Tilapia-derived collagen peptides enhanced fibroblast proliferation/migration, boosted VEGF/FGF, and accelerated oral ulcer healing in preclinical studies.\n\n**L-Glutamine: 15-20g/day (Split dosing throughout the day)**\n\n* **Clinical Nutrition (2012):** Glutamine supplementation reduced wound closure time by 50% (35 vs 70 days, p=0.01) in trauma patients with healing disorders.\n* **Meta-Analysis (2021):** Glutamine ± arginine accelerates epithelialization and wound repair across multiple surgical studies.\n\n**Hyaluronic Acid: 0.8% gel applied to extraction sites (I used Injuv oral HA in place of topical HA)**\n\n* **Third Molar Study (2024):** 0.8% hyaluronic acid gel improved socket healing post-impacted third molar surgery with reduced complications.\n* **Diabetic RCT (2023):** Split-mouth study showed HA gel enhanced bone remodeling and reduced pain in diabetic patients post-extraction.\n* **Med Oral Patol Oral (2020):** Topical hyaluronic acid showed significantly higher wound closure rates (p<0.001) in extraction patients.\n\n**Boron: 3 - 9mg daily**\n\n* **Wound Healing Research:** Boron compounds accelerate wound healing through enhanced collagen synthesis and reduced inflammation.\n* **Oral Surgery Study (2023):** Boric acid combined with standard care showed reduced complications in third molar surgery.\n\n**References:**\n\n1.

Plasma β-CTX concentration decreased from −1 to +6 h (P < 0.05), with no differences between interventions.\r  \n**Conclusions** Ingesting 30 g HC before high-intensity RE augments whole-body collagen synthesis more than 15 g and 0 g HC in resistance-trained young males.",

It smells like dried rose petal but it didn't bother me much. I didn't get any breakouts when I introduced it, so Yay!!!!\nI bought it when I saw 5 types of HA and  peptides in Limese Ad. Unfortunately, peptides are way below in the ingredients list. So can't expect anti- aging benefits from this toner. But I have to say it hydrates the skin really really well. It plumps up the skin whenever I do 3-skin method with this. It's a very good hydrating toner.\n\nHG status: WNRP I guess, not because it's a bad product or anything. It's just I bought it as I couldn't get Kikumasamune high moist lotion.",

The most I ever did was sometimes put cheap dollar store lotion on after showering. \n\nThe way I, personally, finally addressed this was doing some searching on a decent product to try in the shower which I decided on Natrium The Smoother Glycolic Acid Exfoliating body wash that I got on April 13th and for the first 2 weeks, on top of using the Glycolic acid, after showering I used unrefined virgin organic coconut oil but I applied a thick layer and it seemed to worsen it so I stopped.\n\nI don’t really have sensitive skin so I scrubbed the crap out of my legs and arms about every other shower with a loofa, though I haven’t been as rough with scrubbing lately since my KP has improved. I typically shower every other day. \n\nI try to leave the Glycolic acid on my skin for as long as possible in the shower, but I’m impatient and usually only end up leaving it on for around a minute before rinsing. I don’t use any kind of body moisturizer anymore, I just haven’t felt the need to.\n\nAnd for the past 2ish months, I’ve cut down on a lot of sugar and have been eating less processed and overall healthier foods. I also take Omega-3 Fish oil with DHA & EPA, drink Whey protein shakes, drink hydrolyzed Collagen (type 1 and 3) with MCT oil in it, Women’s multivitamin, and recently started vitamin B5 and Zinc picolinate… I can’t say if those supplements have played a role in the improvement but they haven’t hurt.\n\nNot recommending anything, I just wanted to share what has personally worked for me so far and share my joy! :) I know everyone is different and it’s not a “one size fits all” when it comes to KP unfortunately. \n\n(Took these pics not too long after showering so a bit of redness still that pops up after showering in hot water so normally I shower in warm water instead. Also please excuse my leg hair, I’ve been terrified to shave since it makes my KP angry— I’ll be giving Nair a go when I do)\n",

I was familiar with the general ideas, but I wanted to read the papers myself.\n\nI just finished \"[Vitamin C–enriched gelatin supplementation before intermittent activity augments collagen synthesis](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/1/136/4569849?login=false)\" (2016) where there is some discussion regarding rising levels of glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine in blood a certain amount of time after ingesting \"Vitamin C-enriched gelatin\" (basically gelatin mixed with some blackcurrant cordial).\n\nThis made me wonder what effects whey protein isolate has on specifically those four AAs, but also others as well. This also makes me wonder about other protein sources like plant based, hydrolyzed collagen etc. I'm having trouble finding research that covers this information though. I wonder if anyone here has something handy I could read?\n\nI did find comparisons of different whey proteins in \"[Plasma amino acid response after ingestion of different whey protein fractions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18608553/)\" and comparison of plant based proteins in a few posts here as well as some additional papers, but again I'm having a hard time just finding data on AA blood levels at certain periods of time (10minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, etc) after consuming different protein sources. I have a hard time thinking that anything beats whey protein isolate, including Baar's gelatine, but I'd like to see any research or numbers regarding the subject.\n\nUltimately I'm better trying to understand connective tissue health, injuries, and recovery (hopefully repair?), so sources on that stuff would be great if anyone is feeling especially generous.",

I'm still not able to get a huge jump yet or jogging well but that's because I don't want to do anything until I feel bullet proof. \n\n\n\nThe Dr recommendation was knee cartilage and meniscus surgery and to avoid split squats (I specifically asked if they were approved).\nThat was 5 weeks ago. \n\n\n\n\n\nI can do atg split squat flat footed now with no pain. Patrick step and poliquin are my biggest challenges but I just make sure to not work through ANY pain. \n\n\n\n\n\nMy point of this post is just to say that I really feel like I am finally on the right track. With the level of inflammation reduction, and knee pain reduction I've seen plus the major increases in knee ability I'm very optimistic. I'm patient here though. I don't expect to be fixed in 3 weeks or even 3 months. But 1-2 years from now I hope to be moving without any pain. It's my #1 focus at the moment. If this doesn't do it then it will not be for a lack of trying. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn case anyone is interested... I'm also taking type I, II, and III hydrolyzed collagen protein powder, chondroitin, glucosamine, krill oil, and turmeric extract.",

They are often used in conditioning products for damaged hair.  I also see several solvents in there, which can help thin it out and help it feel smooth and slick when applying it, rather than having the consistency of a creamy conditioner.\n\nI've uploaded the ingredient list to [incidecoder.com](http://incidecoder.com) so that the product can be listed there with correct spellings (it seems like the list was pulled from an image rather than copied and pasted) and link to further information about each ingredient, it's just pending moderator approval.",

    "body": "My hands always get dry in the winter, but this year I am taking a medication that acts as a vasoconstrictor and my already terrible circulation is struggling to get any liquid out to my extremities. Less tissue perfusion=drier skin. Even things that were reliable stand-bys while I was on Accutane (Eucerin, lanolin, keeping lotion within reach at all times) are no match for my winter Adderal hand dryness. So I have resorted to hand masking. It’s expensive IMO, even buying the cheaper hand masks and giving some side eye to $9 Sephora masks. But I’m desperate! I couldn't find many reviews for hand masks, so I thought I'd start offering mine. Here are little reviews of the four I have tried so far, from the most to least hydrating.    \nHere’s the TL; DR summary: the Absolute are the most moisturizing and the only one that isn’t scented like cheap grandma perfume, but the Smart Hand Milky Moisture are a bargain at half the price and the only ones with a built in adhesive tab to adjust them to your wrists. Tip: for ones without a built in sticky tab, you can use a hair tie around your wrist more easily than scotch taping once you are gloved.\n\n\n**Absolute New York Repair and Care Hand Mask in Tangerine**    \n**Purchased:** Hmart on sale for $3, regular price $4    \n**Ingredients:** Tangerine Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Tangerine Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA Hand Mask – Rose Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Rose Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA    \n**Thoughts:** This one has a strong tangerine scent, no surprise. I was worried the tangerine would be irritating, but it seemed fine. This mask was so effective at moisturizing my sad parched hand that it convinced me to try the others. My Hmart only had this version, but it comes in rose, green tea, and black pearl, all identical formulas except for the main extract and fragrance.\n\n**Repiel Smart Hand Mask Milky Moisture**     \n**Purchase:** Amazon, box of 10 for $20, even cheaper on ebay    \nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Urea, Glyceryl Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1.2-Hexanediol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Illicium Verum(Anise)Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Arginine, Milk Protein Extract, Goat Milk Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Allantoin, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate    \nThoughts: The standard scent for hand masks appears to be cheap grandma perfume: powdery, soapy floral smell. Except for the first tangerine one, these all smell like grandma in varying degrees. These ones have a medium strength scent that blessedly doesn’t linger. The essence in these is not quite as moisturizing as the Absolute ones, but it’s still good. Annoyingly, it’s not well distributed, at least in the box I got--it’s concentrated in the fingers but the thumb of the gloves doesn’t ever seem to have any, so I have to squish it down into the hand part and then squish my hand around in them for a minute to get the essence properly distributed. What I do like about these is that they have a built in adhesive tab at the wrist. So, after you get them on, you can easily tape them closed tight at the wrist to seal in that moisture goodness. At about half the price of the Absolute, it’s pretty easy to forgive the failings.\n\n**Skin Food Shea Butter Hand Mask**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Honey Extract, Milk Protein Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Disodium Edta, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance    \n**Experience:** I was sooo disappointed that these smelled like grandma, because I expected a pleasant shea butter smell. They don’t smell like shea butter at all, and the moistuzing power is so-so. They also have alcohol pretty high in the ingredients list, which doesn’t impress me in skincare, and even less in something meant to moisturize. \n\n\n**The Face Shop Rich Hand V Special Care**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, dimethicone, butylene glycol, glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, citrus paradis (grapefruit) extract, glyceryl sterate, peg-100 sterate, urea, cetearyl alcohol, alcohol, sorbitan sesquioleate, cyclopentasiloxane, sodium polyacrylate, acrylates/C10-20 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, hydrogenated polydecene, potassium hydroxide, dimethiconol, adenosine, trideceth-6, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, fragrance    \n**Experience:** These have a much milder grandma scent than the others, further mitigated with a pleasant base note of shea or cocoa butter smell, which is weird since they don’t contain either. They were the juiciest feeling hand mask I tried, and I had high hopes for them. Unfortunately, they did virtually nothing. I was honestly amazed at how ineffectual these were for moisturizing, and I can only guess the difference between this and the other masks I tried is due to the dimethicone so high in the ingredients list and lack of more effective moisturizing oil, at least for my skin. \n",

The little bottle absolutely prevents it from going too deep. It kind of hurt in some spots and a little blood come out-but I kept going. Once I got my whole face and neck covered - I used the rest of the serum like you use serums and just completely doused my skin. I went to bed but didn’t lay down until it felt absorbed and dry. I sh*t you not, I woke up to smooth, plumper, healthier face and neck. There are rules to follow for after treatment- like wash your face and use the serum every 12hrs for the first 24hrs and no makeup-so I’m about to do my first 12hr freshen up. I am in shock that this worked. I have heavily damaged skin from a skin eating bacteria 5years ago-and so it is real bumpy and scar’d-when I opened my eyes I immediately rubbed my face and my stomach kind of did a flip,!I ran to the bathroom-my skin hasn’t looked like this since before I got that disease!!!

        "body": "I just received the facial Micro Infusion System from Glov. I live in Wisconsin and it came frozen. The packaging didn’t prevent it from being frozen solid. I reached out to Glov to chat in their 24/7 customer service but didn’t hear back for hours and was told it should be fine to use. I asked for testing/paperwork to prove it should still be effective but now hours/days later, no one is responding to me via chat or email which is concerning. I also googled if the ingredients in the serum which are: carnosine, dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, octanoyl iso hydroxamic acid, 1,2-pentanediol are safe to be frozen and this is what it says online:\n\nNo, generally, carnosine, dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, octanoyl isohydroxamic acid, and 1,2-pentanediol should not be frozen as freezing can potentially damage their molecular structure and affect their efficacy in cosmetic or pharmaceutical applications.  Explanation for each ingredient: Carnosine: This is a naturally occurring dipeptide that is often used in skincare for its antioxidant properties. Freezing can disrupt the delicate protein structure of carnosine, reducing its effectiveness. Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate: Derived from licorice root, this ingredient is known for its anti-inflammatory and soothing effects. Freezing could potentially alter its solubility and stability in a formulation.  Octanoyl Isohydroxamic Acid: This is a preservative commonly used in cosmetics. While it may not be significantly impacted by freezing, it's generally recommended to store it at room temperature to maintain optimal performance. 1,2-Pentanediol: This is a humectant that attracts moisture to the skin. While it may not be severely affected by freezing, it is best practice to store it at room temperature to avoid potential stability issues. \n\nSo….anyone living in cold weather states/countries should be questioning the effectiveness of the serum if they received frozen. I am still waiting to see proof or testing results of the effectiveness of the product. It also shipped from overseas and took 11 days with varying temperatures/weather. So possibly frozen/thawed/frozen and thawed multiple times. Customer service is poor. It took me several days of me reaching out to them via their chat, so then I decided to start emailing them. They said I could return the product and pay for return shipping myself. But when I asked them if they stand 100% behind its effectiveness, even though it’s been frozen and thawed, the answer was yes, but the customer service rep refused to share their name. They would not share any of their testing results or proof of efficacy once their product is frozen and thawed. :( \n\nThey also have terrible reviews on BBB.",

Fortunately, the ingredients are right on the package, so I'll list them here--there are a couple of red flags for the super-sensitive, but again, $3.33 for a box of ten at RRS!!!!!\n\nIngredients: Water, glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol, xantham gum, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, sodium hyaluronate, panax ginseng root extract, panthenol, methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, sodium citrate, disodium EDTA, allantoin, hydrolyzed collagen, portulaca oleracea extract, witch hazel extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, snail secretion filtrate, honey extract, ubiquinone, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, fragrance.\n\nSo not the best ingredient list for everyone, but far and away not the worst.  Again, a full 23ml of essence in each mask, substantial but soft and pliable mask material, and it really does smell very luxurious.  It's also very gentle (for me) on my skin, and **did I mention they're $3.33 for a pack of 10 on RRS???**\n\nThese masks are truly a hidden gem, and I will probably get every variety they make in my next haul!\n\nEdit: Holy crap, you guys.  I took this off after 40 minutes, and I look.....AMAZING!  My skin is radiant, fat, and SUUUPER calm.  I used the extra essence on my chest, and swear to snail, if you  put me in a corset right now, I could stop or start a war.  Maybe start one then stop it five minutes later, my bosom is so luminous.  I also would seriously consider buying this scent as a perfume, it's that pleasant.  For reference, I have combo/oily aging skin with PIH and--touch wood--no allergies or reactions so far.",

A lot of the good stuff that I loved for the skin benefits has been moved down the list considerably. I've always loved this bb cream because the #13 shade fits my skin pretty perfectly, and I'm generally demanding of my makeup in that I want it to be making me look better in the long run as well as the short run. Missha's ingredient list seemed to have some pretty great additions to do just that; It had a decent Pa protection rating and some ingredients I valued such as arbutin, squalane, adenosine, and ceramide.  Now... I think I might start looking for a new daily bb cream. Something with a similar shade, equal or better sun protection, but more potent anti-aging and completion-improving ingredients. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them! \n\nFor the curious - I've included the ingredient lists for comparison. While the old list can be found on various old reviews (such as one I grabbed from [here](http://nouveaucheap.blogspot.com/2012/09/review-missha-perfect-cover-bb-cream.html), the latest rendition on [missha's site](http://www.misshaus.com/m-perfect-cover-bb-cream-spf-42-pa.html) has some considerable changes, at least IMHO. Maybe it's less a big deal to others, idk.\n\nOld Ingredients:\n> Water(Aqua), Cyclomethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Zinc Oxide, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mineral Oil, Phenyl Trimethicone, Talc, Arbutin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Dimethicone, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Squalane, Adenosine, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Polyethylene, Beeswax(Cera Alba), Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Caviar Extract, Algae Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Fagus Sylvatica Bud Extract, Ceramide 3, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance(Parfum), Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxycitronellal, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Citronellol\nMAY CONTAIN[+/-; Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891), Iron Oxides(CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499)]\n\nLatest Rendition:\n>Water (aqua), cyclomethicone, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, zinc oxide, propylene glycol, titanium dioxide, caprylic/capric triglyceride, peg-10 dimethicone, cetyl peg/ppg-10/1 dimethicone, arbutin, mineral oil, glycerin, polyethylene, talc, phenyl trimethicone, beeswax (cera alba), iron oxides (ci 77492), sodium chloride, iron oxides (ci 77491 ), iron oxides (ci 77499), methylparaben, dimethicone, propylparaben, rosa canina fruit oil, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, squalane, hydrolyzed collagen, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, disodium edta, adenosine, caviar extract, algae extract, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, sodium hyaluronate, fagus sylvatica bud extract, ceramide 3, fragrance (parfum), hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, butylphenyl methylpropional, benzyl salicylate, hydroxycitronellal, alpha-isomethyl ionone, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, citronellol\n\n**EDIT**: Just fixed a link and some formating :P",

I'm at the point where I'll try just about anything to nurse my tendons back to health (already all over eccentrics and stretching routines) but there's no way in hell I can justify the $45USD price tag.  Instead I found this on Amazon for a fraction of the price:  \n  \nWebber Naturals Collagen Plus, Lysine and Vitamin C Tablets, 120-Count   https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00L3WRUR0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_vkXMDbNYZ2GN2  \n  \nEDIT: I realize the quantities in each serving are different, so let's just assume I eat a handful of these in order to equal 1 serving of Eric's supplement. \n  \nIt's hydrolyzed collagen with vitamin C - basically the exact same thing Eric is trying to sell me every 5 minutes in his podcast.  \n  \nI can't seem to find any meaningful difference between the products besides the pricetag.

Only removal of aggravating exercise(s) and implementation of a good eccentric-concentric loading scheme to build up good load tolerance and strength in the tissues will.\n\nHere's the study for that from the book: Drew BT, Smith TO, Littlewood C, Sturrock B. Do structural changes (eg, collagen/matrix) explain the response to therapeutic exercises in tendinopathy: a systematic review. Br J Sports Med. 2014 Jun;48(12):966-72. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091285. Epub 2012 Oct 31. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23118117\n\n> The available literature does not support observable structural change as an explanation for the response of therapeutic exercise except for some support from HSR. Future research should focus on indentifying other explanations including neural, biochemical and myogenic changes.\n\nNo structural change such as increase in collagen in the tendon is responsible for the therapeutic improvements via rehabilitation.\n\n* As other people have said, you can make your own with gelatin and vitamin C if you want to try. It may supplement healing at most... and maybe only a bit or not at all. If you have the extra cash and want to try... go for it. I'm of the opinion that it could possibly help, but if it does it's going to help some small incremental improvement such as like 1 to maybe 5ish% max. A good rehabilitation program is what is going to be 95-100% of the effectiveness.\n\n* There was another study I saw but did not put in the book, but there's some evidence that long term increases in collagen in tendons are mainly only seen in adolescents and not adults. This is why kids that have climbed since they were younger tend to have \"climber hands\" whereas people who start when they're adults don't see much actual growth in their joints, tendons, and so on.\n\nThat's all folks. The rest is random speculation and pseudoscience. \n\nMy other conclusion in other thread is similar:\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* I agree with the conclusion that it won't hurt and may help.\n* Without more proper studies, it's probably for those with extra disposable income who may want probable marginally better gains.\n* I'd be wary of anyone shilling their particular supplement and probably avoid them altogether.\n* If you do want to try it, Vitamin-C enriched collagen is probably the way to go. You can make your own with vitamin C and gelatin. And consuming them before exercise is recommended over after.\n\nI am also personally going to run a gelatin (basically collagen) and vitamin C experiment on myself to see if I notice anything. I have some occasional flares from left golfer's elbow and also some pulleys that are a bit sore here and there. \n\nAlso, if anyone wants some more studies to look at on collagen (and other supplements like fatty acids, hyaluronic acid, etc.) supplementation they can PM me.",

I'm a biologist, not a sports physiologist, but I can still read a paper and see that the design is poor, and the results are ... sparse.\n\nHere's a perfect example:\n\n[Figure 4 from Shaw+Baar](https://i.imgur.com/Fb7Te7m.png)\n\nnotice anything? Placebo (i.e. carbs) has the same effect on (engineered) ligaments as collagen!\n\nHere are some general tips for evaluating these papers:\n\n**Who is being tested?** Athletes? Geriatric patients? Shaw study was for \"recreationally active\" people, so that is good\n\n**How many people were tested**? Eight (!!) were tested in the Shaw study. Not good.\n\n**What control was used**? For Shaw, it should have been another protein source like whey, but was carbs.\n\n**What populations are being tested for difference?** In Shaw they claim significance by testing pre and post workout, but placebo has the same effect as collagen \n\n**Have other teams seen the same effect**? not the case for Shaw AFAIK\n\nI'll leave you with this quote from their own paper:\n\n\" Finally, although the focus of the manuscript has been on the nutritional intervention, the exercise intervention was effective at increasing collagen synthesis on its own. \"\n\nAny interest in a tomatometer for papers relevant to climbing, by a Trained Scientist?",

If your diet is alright you don't need to supplement any of them. Eg that 1g of Leucine per serving is even less than what you get from 100g of beef. If your diet is even remotely focused on protein and/or you supplement protein you get more than enough of any of the 'non-collagen' amino acids. \n\nYou'll get the same benefits, if any, if you buy generic hydrolized collagen and chuck in a generic vitamin c supplement. \n\nDo you listen to climbsci? They have an episode about supplements and discuss collagen amongst many others. Afaik it contains predominantly certain amino acids which, when timed right (30min prior to exercise I think) can help with tendon health. \n\nBut honestly, collagen without the appropriate exercises won't do anything while doing the right exercises without collagen will do it.

    "body": "I decided to review the Son & Park Beauty Gel because it's supposed to be paired up with the Beauty Water yet it's not so apparent as to what it's supposed to do or how you would use it in your routine. I love the Beauty Water and it's helped heal my bf's acne scars faster but I wanted to shine some light onto it's neglected sibling since there were almost no reviews online.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSimply put, it's a light-weight gel moisturizer that would quickly absorb into your skin and provide the right amount of hydration in order to prep your face for base makeup. It sounds like it's a primer but it's not like your typical makeup primer where it will fill in lines/uneven skin. It will simply help to give light hydration to prevent dry spots/patches since that will make your base makeup look patchy or flaky.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIt also has little capsules filled with hydrolyzed collagen that will burst upon application; this capsule technology keeps the ingredients fresh until use (and make it look really kewl). There's a lot of botanical and fruit extracts in there but I have a suspicion the main concentration is water and well, gel.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMy final verdict is that this seems great for The Minialist who wants something short, does the job fine for perfect base makeup but I suppose this product isn't for me in the long run. I want morrrrrreeeee </Little Mermaid song> There's also a very large amount of alcohol in it which I know is a turn-off for some people. I just don't like how it feels like I'm spreading Purell on my face (it smells like it too). Not the end all be all of moisturizers for me, but good enough for me to just use up. Great, this will take me over a year probably. Rating 3 out of 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nYou can read my [full review here](http://cecibeautytherapy.com/2015/09/28/son-and-park-beauty-gel/).",

It's misleading and frankly unpleasant.\n\nThe Restore PM formula is another letdown — 3.5mg of melatonin per serving is far too much. The generally recommended dose is around 0.3mg, so this is over ten times that.\n\nI'm also frustrated that an unflavored product ended up tasting overwhelmingly sweet. It feels deceptive, and it really upset me.\n\nConsidering how expensive these supplements are, I expected far better quality and transparency. Unfortunately, I'm now outside the 30-day return window, but I still feel a refund would be fair. I don’t know if this is something the company can make right, but I certainly hope they try.",

The expiration date is stamped on the back underneath some kind of warehouse unit number It's on sale frequently there as well...\nSo Do you actually BRIGHTEN? Yes. YMMV BUT here are my results\n10 days in a row, if you skip two days (you'll see it) you'll have to start over...smh. There's no Vitamin C if you want something extreme..everything is \"natural\" and heck this really smells like oatmeal and feels...quite wet and soothing. The mask is quite transparent, so if you have acne or redness you should be able to see it underneath \n\nI will now type out the ingredients \n\nWater, Glycosy Trehalsoe/Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate (Trehalose), Xanthan gum, MethylParaben, Phenoxyethanol, Tranexamic Acd, D-Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Alpha-Arbutin, Allantoin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic acid, Frangrance (HAHA OATMEAL FRAGRANCE). \n\nSo. as we can see here This IS SOME PRETTY cheap stuff. \nI believe it's around $10 usd or 300 if you're in Taiwan. So would I buy this? NO haha my mom buys this for me and I am 100% appreciative. I think it's most effective for anyone who's skin is mildy oil with a few pimples at times. IF YOU have a bit of extreme acne (borderline cystic or pretty much cystic ;A;) it doesn't break me out. \n2/5 I use this when I run out of my vitamin c stuff (dr wu or dewytree) \n\nThank you for reading ;A; ",

    "body": "Peach Slices Peace Popsicle Sheet Masks\n\nAlthough I have been lucky enough to get some sheet masks sent to me from some amazing retailers/brands recently...my own personal (bought with my own cash) sheet mask stash is nearing the end.\n\nI’ve been trying to not be as much of a hoarder of masks this year in hopes that it offsets some of the other one-time use products I consume each day (cotton pads). \n\nAnd in working through the last of my stash...I decided to save what I hope will be the best for last. And by best I mean...Peach & Lily/Peach Slices.\n\nI have had such amazing luck with their sheet mask offerings and I have been holding onto these Peach Slices Peace Popsicle Sheet Masks for months and months...waiting for a special occasion lol!\n\nEach of the Peach popsicle Masks focuses on a specific benefit/”flavor” including Pomegranate Protect + Nourish, Mango Hydrate + Glow, and Pineapple Clarify + Calm.\n\nSome of the main selling points for me about previous sheet masks I used from Peach Slices (Aqua Glow Sheet Masks) were the unique formulations for each mask and a general focus on results driven formulations. The Peach Popsicle Sheet Masks continue with that trend.\n\nIngredients such as Pomegranate, Mango, and Pineapple Extract are found here (of course)...but other things like Centella Asiatica, Willow Bark Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Kiwi Fruit Extract, and Calendula Flower Extract make their way into the formulations as well.\n\nThe mask material here is a super classic cotton style sheet mask that is comfortable and cooling once applied. I found the material to sit well...but not have that “silkiness” that I have been loving from some Taiwanese masks (23.5n Rice Soothing Mask...amazing!). \n\nEach mask delivered on its claims...offering mild brightening, calming, and nourishing benefits. The pomegranate version includes BHA and my skin was left with a slight smoothness that surprised and impressed me. With the mango...I appreciated the boost of dewyness and slight plumping effect (from the intense hydration).\n\nBut, I'd have to say that my favorite overall was the pineapple “flavor”. While this mask is missing classic calming ingredients like centella asiatica or chamomile...it overall formula left my skin looking less red/irritated. There was also a brightening effect that I appreciated.\n\nDon’t let the fun packaging fool you...these sheet masks are packed with hydration and calming no matter which one you pick. The Peach Slices Peace Popsicle Sheet Masks are a fun and effective treat to my routine and something I would totally come back to! \n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily $3.49 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/collections/peach-slices](https://www.peachandlily.com/collections/peach-slices) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztgksawucfj51.jpg?width=5130&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae409604c80ab26752c02cd9fb6f6e4e9994c10b",

It’s hydrating and softening and kept my skin nice and healthy throughout the dry winter. It also sinks in immediately and applies really nicely, despite it being a little viscous from the bottle. Don’t sleep on their NMF masks either, they’re pretty solid! For reference, I am combination skin that leans dry during the winter.",
