    "body": "And while I love the length and the definition, may hair becomes a tangled and dry mess before the end of the week when I wash my hair (as is shown in the last pic). I‚Äôve had to refresh about once a week but that just involves adding product and spraying my hair with water. It‚Äôs still tangled and oily at the roots though. I deep conditioned last weekend used lots of water to style my hair in a fully detangled a wash and go. \n\nI‚Äôve never delt with an oily scalp before nor have I worn my hair out all week until wash day.  I‚Äôm taking a break from ponytails and high maintenance styles to give my edges a break. I use a cream - Lottabody Coconut & Shea Oil Activate Me Curl Activator and a botanical gel on top - Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic Curl Stimulator on soaking wet hair. I also use Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Shampoo and Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Conditioner With Castor Oil.\n\nMy shampoo , conditioner  and cream, have a lot of oils so maybe that is the problem? But I‚Äôve been using the same products for months before I cut my hair. I would like to know what can do better maybe during wash day to make my hair last all week. I‚Äôm willing to change my hair products as well.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here‚Äôs a looong review post of many of the products I‚Äôve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I‚Äôm a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don‚Äôt wear makeup on a daily ‚Äì or even weekly ‚Äì basis. I‚Äôve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I‚Äôm in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I‚Äôm average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I‚Äôve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently‚Ä¶ boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it‚Äôs fine. This is many people‚Äôs holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It‚Äôs affordable, nice pump, doesn‚Äôt try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don‚Äôt love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It‚Äôs standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn‚Äôt remove all makeup, it‚Äôs as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don‚Äôt leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that‚Äôs fine, so I don‚Äôt know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it‚Äôs important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they‚Äôre pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it‚Äôs a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that‚Äôs about it. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula‚Äôs Choice wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don‚Äôt think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It‚Äôs an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don‚Äôt have the data. I hope it is, though. I‚Äôm also worried that it‚Äôll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It‚Äôs one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time‚Ä¶ And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN‚Äôs products, so beware. Just because it says it‚Äôs natural fragrance, doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt mess with your skin. The word ‚Äúnatural‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we‚Äôve found we‚Äôre all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It‚Äôs a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn‚Äôt use it during the daytime. I‚Äôm not currently using it, because I‚Äôm trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn‚Äôt really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don‚Äôt know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol‚Äô retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn‚Äôt released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it‚Äôs even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôll wait a while longer to see if there‚Äôs any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn‚Äôt really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it‚Äôs a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn‚Äôt contain any preservatives. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin‚Äô. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You‚Äôve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you‚Äôre from Northern Europe. Anyway, it‚Äôs a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it‚Äôs great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don‚Äôt want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It‚Äôs called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you‚Äôre allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you‚Äôre allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It‚Äôs my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I‚Äôm too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It‚Äôs gel-like, but it doesn‚Äôt melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn‚Äôt seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn‚Äôt sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don‚Äôt buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn‚Äôt all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it‚Äôs called a night mask, it‚Äôs a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this‚Ä¶ right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don‚Äôt know. My skin is normal, so I don‚Äôt really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I‚Äôd appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I‚Äôve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don‚Äôt really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention‚Ä¶ It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it‚Äôs bad for your skin. Anyway, it‚Äôs an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because‚Ä¶ I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I‚Äôll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it‚Äôs 10% glycolic acid it‚Äôs still very gentle, and that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven‚Äôt used it recently because I‚Äôm using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn‚Äôt ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I‚Äôm quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don‚Äôt need one, I‚Äôm just so extra. It‚Äôs a HG product for me, because it‚Äôs the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it‚Äôs great if you have sturdy skin, and you‚Äôre lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won‚Äôt oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of‚Ä¶ dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it‚Äôs not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you‚Äôre looking for a vitamin c product. It‚Äôs perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won‚Äôt cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn‚Äôt make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: ‚Ä¶why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there‚Äôs that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven‚Äôt seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven‚Äôt been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don‚Äôt particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I‚Äôll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so‚Ä¶\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Ysth√©al intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as ‚ÄúAv√®ne RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream‚Äù, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don‚Äôt know what retinaldehyde is, well, it‚Äôs one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol √† retinaldehyde √† retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Av√®ne‚Äôs lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don‚Äôt have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I‚Äôm only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I‚Äôve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you‚Äôre 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn‚Äôt seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They‚Äôve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you‚Äôre pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8‚Äôs retinaldehyde products, plus it was Av√®ne that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

I love the product but I started using the coco shea oil and fell so in love, I needed a butter too. Originally I was just gonna bring one in to exchange but decided to part with two since they came out with these new ones.\n\n-Sprays: Bruh I was so hyped to see they released coco shea as an FFM. I'm gonna drown myself in it omg ü§§. Pink paradise, holy frig. As someone who does not like BR540, this is the only product I like that steps foot in that frag profile vicinity. I originally was gonna completely pass on it because people were saying its similar. Glad I smelled it in store! It's got this fruity undertone, incredibly sugary sweet, it's so girly. Also I seen some people say they can't smell it, I could smell wiffs of it on my shirt throughout my shift all night. Next spray sale I am definitely getting a full size.\n\n-body wash: I don't think this needs explaining hahaha.\n\n-SPF: I wanted to try their formula since it was 9.95 for full size. May or may not get a spray but I got SPF out the wazoo atm, not sure if I need to throw a spray in the mix. As for the scent, it does smell like PPS but you can detect the chemical sunscreen smell underneath. It ain't bad, though. I tried a bit on my hand it and it dried down nicely so fingers crossed she ain't sticky everywhere.",

Use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (or a glycerin based cleanser like Prequel) at night. In the morning, you can just rinse your face with water but no cleanser. Use a hydrating serum first followed by a nice moisturizer. Look for a moisturizer that includes ingredients like ceramides, cholesterol, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and lipids. Prequel is my favorite brand with some really nice, gentle products. But there are lots of great products out there.

After your skin has absorbed the product, you shouldn't have to fear your moisturizer will disrupt the actives. Also, I do not oil cleanse, but from what I understand you have to wipe the oil off in order for it to be oil cleansing. Just putting oil on your face won't disturb anything.",

Next to cleansing, this cream was basically our only skincare product and has been a holy grail for both of us (dry skin, but fairly smooth and calm). After a recent stock up of the product, we noticed a rancid, unpleasant smell coming from the newly bought pots. We decided to buy another batch, this time the tinned version. Same problem.\n\nTurns out the formula of the newer tins are totally different than the old ones (see pics and ingredient list down below). Notice the newer formula list is almost twice as long. It went from a nostalgic powdery scent to a disgusting, rancid coconut-like smell which we just can't ignore. Unfortunately, our Nivea era might have just come to an end.

        "body": "So the first step is to try the \"full\" wavy styling thing.\n\nFirst of all, clarify and then deep condition, just to make sure you're starting from scratch.\n\nThen, the routine:  Try combing or brushing your hair gently in the shower while it's full of conditioner, until fulyl detangled. Then rinse the conditioner out, letting the water stream down your hair until it's really smooth.\n\nTurn off the water, and very gently apply your leave-in while your hair is sopping, dripping wet. Try rubbing the product in your palms and then just skating your hands down your hair, the \"prayer hands\" method. The idea is not to disturb your hair after rinsing. \n\nThen apply a hold product. Many people use gel and mousse, or just one or the other. I like Not Your Mother's Curl Talk mousse to start, because it's not too expensive. With your thick hair you may need more than you think. Apply this the same way you did with the leave-in. \n\nYour hair should still be dripping wet. Now, with your products in, scrunch your hair by gathering the ends in your palms and lifting the hair toward your scalp, so the hair coils up as you lift. This will begin removing water from your hair. Scrunch, scrunch, scrunch!\n\nUsing a cotton Tshirt, gently scrunch some more of the moisture out. Do not rub, just lift and squeeze.\n\nThen diffuse on low heat, low air flow. Recommend looking at videos on pixie diffusing to start -- basically, with the dryer off, take a curl clump or a few of them, gather them in the bowl of the diffuser, and lift toward your roots. Then turn the dryer on, leaving it motionless for a minute, then turn off the dryer and slowly lower the diffuser bowl back away from your hair.\n\nDo this until dry, or until you go insane and cannot take it anymore.\n\nThen do not touch your hair. Don't! DON'T! Just let it air dry the rest of the way. Test its dryness without disturbing the clumps by sticking your fingers in sideways and scissoring a section of hair between your fingers.\n\nOnce it's really, really fully dry, if your hair has any crunch from the gel/mousse, you can gently scrunch out that crunch, using the same motions as when you scrunched in the gel when wet. Do not brush or comb your hair dry, until your next shower.\n\nThis ^ routine is a good place to start, but every step often requires fine tuning because everyone's hair is different. Some diffuse upside down or rightside up; some air dry; some only hover diffuse; some don't use leave-in at all; some don't use a T-shirt (micro plop); some fully plop for quite some time, etc. It's a ton of trial and error for a while!",

I read that applying baby oil after a shower (while still wet) is a quick and easy way to moisturize.  What oils can I use instead of J&J Baby Oil?\n\nI was thinking of blending equal parts Shea Oil and Vitamin E Oil and applying that while still wet after a shower.  I've heard goods things about Coconut oil too, but isn't that solid at room temp?  Again, I just want an oily blend thing that I can rub on in the shower.  Thanks for your help.",

Coconut and shea butters are both solid at room temperature, but coconut oil melts pretty quickly at even slightly warmer temps. Coconut oil is, in my experience, less moisturizing than some other oils like shea butter, cocoa butter, olive oil, etc. Sesame oil is a dry oil that, again, isn't as concentrated as shea or cocoa butter, but as a dry oil, it soaks in really quickly, which is nice. Jojoba oil is also good for body moisture since it is structurally similar to your body's own oil.\n\nMake a mixture with a 5:1 ratio of whatever oil/butter you want to glycerin. Glycerin is a humectant, so it helps draw moisture to your skin. It will feel a little sticky/tacky at first, but then should soak in nicely.\n\nYou may try applying an oil before you shower, as well, and only soaping up the parts of your body that need it (\"pits 'n' bits\", as some people say--add in the feet, too!). \n\nMake sure you're not taking long, hot showers, as that will dry out your skin even more.\n\nYou may try dry brushing before showering as well, to exfoliate/slough off that dry skin that's sitting on top of your healthy skin. If you do that, don't apply oil before getting into the shower, as you'll need to rinse off any dry skin you've brushed off. \n\n*Edit: get a humidifier!! The [Crane Drop Humidifier](http://www.amazon.com/Crane-Gallon-COOL-humidifier-White/dp/B001ADL1SG) is consistently highly rated and is pretty affordable. No filters, either!",

First up will be a moisturizing bath oil, then a hair growth promoting beard oil with a similar yet lighter and more absorbent option for the scalp, followed by a facial oil and finally a facial cleansing oil. \n\nI've set out and purchased a few ingredients from my local crunchy store and holy smokes is this an expensive hobby! I know it'll pay me back in the long run, but the upstart is substantial IMO. Furthermore, the heavy hitting ingredients, primarily carrier oils, can't be smelled before purchasing (which is a huge concern for me) as they're sealed. Which I obviously appreciate! \n\nI'd like to discuss carrier oils with you guys, and hopefully end up creating a decent post for other users down the line regarding carrier oils! If you have any comments about favorite carrier oils for their purpose and/or scent, or favorite resources to share, I'd love to check them out!\n\nSo far I did manage to find some handy resources addressing carrier oil properties. I imagine I'll use very lightweight and absorbent liquid oils for facial/hair applications, while being open to slower absorbing and even solid oils with higher melting points for bath and for cleansing. Each of the following resources added value to that end:\n\n* [This post from Up Nature lists 20 carrier oils](https://www.up-nature.com/blogs/news/top-20-best-carrier-oils-for-essential-oils-revealed) and explains their properties, with some recipes thrown in. I liked the extensiveness of the list. \n\n* [I love this website](http://www.humblebeeandme.com/a-guide-to-carrier-oil-substitutions/) and in particular that post that breaks down key elements of oils, such as weight and absorbency. \n\n* [This site is also a rather extensive list of oils and their properties](http://www.sproutinghealthyhabits.com/carrier-oils/) that also includes a printable reference chart.\n\nI still would like to hear more about people's experiences with different carrier oils, particularly from a scent standpoint. I would absolutely use sweet almond oil for everything... I positively adore the light vanilla/cherry/nutty/sweet scent, but I'm highly allergic. So far I've tried grapeseed (smelled like a football/basketball), jojoba (smelled faintly rancid or sweaty to my nose), evening primrose (smelled strongly of playdough), fractionated coconut (I wish it smelled more like coconut), shea oil (partially solid and crystallized, but a pleasant if faint sweet scent). \n\nCan't wait to read your thoughts and experiences!",

For instance, rosehip oil has a short shelf life (six months or less - must be refrigerated). It is supposed to smell like herbaceous. If it smells like fishy or warm mayo, it means it has gone rancid. It is better to use rosehip CO2 extract because it has a longer shelf life (2 years in a fridge).\n\nSweet almond oil doesn't have that particular smell. If it has a hint of vanilla or cherry scent, it means they added fragrance to their almond oil.\n\nI buy my oils from Garden of Wisdom. I haven't had bad experiences with any of their oils.

I usually wear natural twists if I am doing a protective style but I never experienced the Itch‚Ñ¢Ô∏è until now.\n\n I think I found a good routine to keep my scalp from itching and to reduce build up. At first, I tried to use tea tree, but with the gel, I started getting white build up. I thought of what other antimicrobial substances I could use and thought of witch hazel. I am not sure if people are already doing this but it changed my life. It doesn‚Äôt weigh my hair down or dry it out. If I do find my scalp is too dry I will alternate between the witch hazel and a bit of shea oil.\n\nHas anyone tried witch hazel? I think next time I might get no gel braids so I don‚Äôt go through half a bottle!",

Take care with oil selection as you will be sitting in them in the bath\n | **Total** | **100** | \n\n**Equipment:**\n\n* A means of heating your mixture.\n* A small pan (a milk pan is usually good).\n* Spoons.\n* Scales that can weigh down to 1 gram.\n* 1 bottle with lotion pump dispenser and a funnel to fill.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\nAdd the polyglyceryl-3 palmitate, glyceryl caprylate, macadamia butter and jojoba butter to the pan.\n\nHeat gently to around 50C while stirring to ensure the mixture is thoroughly combined.\n\nTake off the heat and add in the macadamia oil, shea oil and Vitamin E with mixing.\n\nOnce cooled to below 40C add your choice of essential oils up to 2% (2 grams in 100g or approx. 40 drops) for use in the bath or 0.5-1% for facial use.\n\nMix well then decant into your pump pack.\n\n**Directions for use:**\n\nWhen completed this will look like a thickened oil and can be pumped out and put into the bath to turn it milky and to help condition the skin while bathing. If you don't have a bath the mixture can be used as a facial wash for dry skin as the polyglyceryl-3 palmitate will gently remove dirt from the face while the oils and butters will moisturize. Be sure to rinse off and pat dry before continuing your usual routine.\n\n**Storage & Shelf Life:**\n\nShelf life testing hasn't been carried out but the mixture is expected to remain stable and usable if kept dry for between 3-6 months. No preservative is required as this is an oil-only mix and the oils used are relatively stable against oxidation. Keep away from bright light, moisture and extreme heat and cold as with all cosmetic formulations.\n\n**Precautions:**\n\nGeneral: If you are pregnant, breast feeding, or suffering from a health disorder, please consult your aroma therapist or health care professional before using essential oils topically.\n\nEssential oils can irritate sensitive skin, you don't have to add them to this recipe and always perform a patch test on your blend before using the product on the body or face. Glyceryl Caprylate can sting very sensitive skin. It is required in this recipe to help the formulation function but if you have a sensitivity to this ingredient or try your blend and it stings you can leave this out. We have reduced the level of Glyceryl Caprylate in this formula to 5% (from a recommended 10%) to reduce the likelihood of irritation.\n\nSOURCE: [newdirections.com.au](http://www.newdirections.com.au/recipes/recipes_view.php?id=277)",

Panthenol & Pentavitin can also add to the tackiness. \n\n> How long would I need to mix phase 1 and phase 2 together? Until a lotion is formed? \n\nUntil your emulsion has formed. It depends on what you are using to homogenize your phases. If you are using a hand blender, do it in short burst. It's easy to over do it and break your emulsion.\n\n> How long will I need to mix the phase 3 ingredients into the lotion? \n\nIt depends on what you are using to homogenize your phase 3. If you are using a propeller mixer, it doesn't take long as long as it's evenly mixed. If not just use a whisk or other thing to stir it in to ensure evenness. \n\n> Is the amount of emulsifying wax too much to too little? \n\nOlivem 1000 is prone to soaping. Soaping can happen for a few reasons, and one of them is too much emulsifier compared to your lipids. Your percentage of lipids are too low. You might want to have your Olivem 1000 at 2%, then add another low HLB co-emulsifier at 1% to aid emulsion stability. You can choose glyceryl stearate or others, depending on what you have.",

More importantly, I would be concerned about it being a bit too much for your preservative.\n\nThe minimum recommended usage amount for Olivem 1000 when used by itself, even with xanthan gum to stabilize it, seems to be 5%. I've only seen 3% used in formulations when there are other emulsifiers or co-emulsifiers beyond a water phase stabilizer like xanthan gum.\n\nIf you want thin or customizable thickness, and can get it and don't mind that it isn't popularly green, glyceryl stearate & PEG-100 stearate (simulsol/arlacel/many other names 165 or glyceryl stearate self-emulsifying at MYOB/SaveonCitric) works very well for this. I haven't tried glyceryl stearate citrate. I have used glyceryl stearate SE (glyceryl stearate with potassium stearate), and I can say that it would probably be thicker than you want.\n\n1. It would typically be a few minutes with an immersion blender. It turns extra white when the emulsion forms. Then you would blend it for up to a few minutes periodically while it cools.\n\n2. You only need to mix the cool down in until is is fully blended together.\n\n3. Too much is not really an issue in that it won't cause a failure the way too little will. Too little for Olivem 1000. For fatty acid based solid emulsifiers, the usage rates are all different. For 165, the usage range is 4-5% for any size oil phase. For polawax/emulsifying wax NF, ~25% of the oils/oil solubles including fragrance, but you can use more if you want.",

I don't think you need that much gum either. just enough to stabilize. You might want to look into adding like 1% cetyl alchol as it is a stabilizer and makes a nice feeling lotion. Also while Olivem does thicken a lotion at the rate you are using it with the amount of water in your formula you will be fine. Especially if you reduce the gum to .2 % and just use xanthan gum. \n\nWatch that PH because Niacinimide should only be used for PH 6 or higher otherwise it breaks down. \n\nAs far as I know you do need to add the oil phase to the water phase.",

For epoxies, it takes quite a long time or highly elevated temperatures for this diffusion to occur to any significant degree. The end result, if you could force it into such a condition, is a minor degradation of mechanical properties and a small amount of swelling. The test we designed was to demonstrate that any effect of compounds typically used around a bike is negligible. \nHopefully the same will apply to carbon used to manufacture arrows.\nThanks for all the responses üòÉüòÉ",

    "body": "\"Straight, No Chaser\" is the name of a famous jazz piano piece.\n\nI've been wading into the SA waters for a bit over a month.  Started with unrefined shea oil.  Per Wikipedia, the fatty acid content ratios vary quite a bit, especially by geographic source.  Interesting stuff.  Yellow.  Doesn't taste either good like butter or bad like......well, whatever.  Shea, cocoa butter, natural sources tend to have a lot of oleic acid and other diluters of the desired stearic acid. \n\nI bought a 3 pound bag of SA for $18.  It consists of tiny white granules, much like fine sand.  They claim \"food grade,\" but who knows how they mean that.  No, I'm not worried about food grade or other purity issues.  I'll leave that to the anal retentives. \n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050LKJ6Y/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o01\\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050LKJ6Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n\n(A side note is someone interjected into the Fire in the Bottle blog that when buying SA, you are getting up to 50% palmitic acid.  Makes no sense.  Legally, at the least.  Both palmitic and SA have melting points only about 7 degrees apart, so if the refining consisted of doing it by temperature, raw shea refined, removing the oleic acid, might have up to 10% or so palmitic.  But certainly not 50%.  There is no natural source that has that much palmitic acid. )\n\nRight away, I realized that although my intention was using it for SA butter, these tiny granules could be mixed with anything and consumed.  I put a tablespoon (9 grams, FYI) into a cup of lukewarm water.  Chugged it.  Straight, no chaser.  Beautiful.\n\nI put 4 tablespoons in a whey drink, beautiful.  One does need to stir to prevent settling.\n\nMaking a hamburger?  Sprinkle it on and mix. \n\nMix with sour cream.  Yogurt.  Beautiful.\n\nAll with no oleic acid.  Pure stearic acid.\n\nStraight, no chaser.",

It is a urinary tract infection drug that works wonderful for biofilm infections, has a tiny molecular weight so it passes BBB easily and has shown promise for things like brain amoeba and cancer. Anyway my fistula when's from needing to be popped every few days to now I can only feel the remnant of where it used to be. Sort of like when you have a pimple and it heals but you can still feel the pimple bump.  I had a colorectal surgeon look at it in 2021 and he said he needs to do the surgery where they cut it open and let it heel etc.\n\nTime will tell if it is completely healed which I know would be rare but if an anal fistula is a infection maybe this drug works well on infections in the colon? I also dap the anus with shea oil after a BM which is alti-inflammatory and could be helping but I do not think it is the contributing factor. Perhaps the fistula is still intact but is in a remission like state where it does not cause any discomfort. \n\nAnyway wanted to share my odd story.

        "body": "Hi. Your fistula is mostly likely still there, just ‚Äúdormant‚Äù or not having any active infections. It‚Äôs true that fistulas do not go away on their own. If you had an abscess, I would say you‚Äôre probably OK. But a fistula needs surgery for repair. I‚Äôm pretty sure I had a fistula for 4-5 years before it became a problem. So it‚Äôs true that you can live with it unbothered for some time (sounds like the case for you). However, it eventually will get infected. The fistula is actually an under the skin tunnel. So leaving that tunnel open and untreated creates the perfect environment for bacteria to get inside and cause an abscess. So you won‚Äôt have any problems until it develops into an abscess. And there is no time limit of when that happens, and who knows, maybe you‚Äôre lucky and it never happens? But I personally would rather get the fistula healed than go through an abscess that requires drainage + fistulotomy because the inflammation makes it more difficult to see / repair the fistula and often times requires a second surgery. So after all I‚Äôve been through, if I were you, I‚Äôd bite the bullet and get the surgery. You‚Äôre truly ‚Äúdown‚Äù for 5-10 days so it‚Äôs not that bad. But regardless, I respect your decision for you body, just be warned it could end as a bad abscess one day and those are a pain in the ass (lol)",

When the BOGO sale was happening at Walgreens, I decided to try the Mousse- just to see.\n\n\"SheaMoisture's Coconut & Hibiscus Frizz-Free Mousse enhances natural curl memory and wave pattern. No sticky, crunchy or flaky residue-just high impact volume with a soft finish.

I haven't found this in everystore that carries SM, but in a fair amount of them.\n\n\n**How to Use**\n\n\"Divide damp hair into sections. Apply 2 to 3 pumps to each section and comb through. Style as desired.\"\n\n**Pros**\n\nIt wasn't waxy!! Yay! It seemed moisturizing also, so that's great.  Light- didn't weigh down my fine hair.\n\n**Cons**\n\nNo hold whatsoever.  If I'm paying $10 for a product I'll go through quickly(trust me, I'm using a lot of product and still not getting the results I want), I want it to actually work. I feel like it's expensive on its own and doesn't offer the moisture AND hold I wanted.\n\n**Overall**\n\nIf you have hair that doesn't frizz easily, this might be the product for you. My hair is fairly porous, and it needs a bit of hold to keep it in clumps instead of frizzing out. This product was not it. :( Sad times.",

I tried to SOTC this morning, but I'm not sure if I did it right? My hair didn't seem very crunchy (not enough gel?). \n\nHow would you go about using the products I've bought? Do you put the curl creme into wet hair? Before or after the gel? On dry hair? Help! üòü",

    "body": "So my scalp is regularly PAINFULLY itchy, particularly at the back. The pain often wakes me up. I have dandruff issues that come and go, but it isn't very bad and doesn't seem to be related. \n\n\nFor reference, I have curly but not thick hair, have been totally sulfate free for about 6 months and mostly sulfate free for about a year before that (and this is an issue that predates the switch). I live in the PNW so it's relatively humid year around. I wash my hair about twice a week and my current hair routine is v small amount of living proof PHD shampoo to deal w/ buildup, l'oreal cleansing balm, shea moisture shea butter conditioner. But this is isn't what I'm interested in discussing. I also regularly use argan oil on my scalp.\n\n\nBasically, the most effective relief from the pain/itching is shea moisture's African black soap scalp elixir. But I'm almost out and it's really hard to find in Canada so I'm trying to replace it. The ingredients are:\n\n\nDeionized Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Salicylic Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Vegetable Protein, Melia Azodirachta (Neem) Seed Oil, Charcoal Powder, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Shea Oil, Castor Isostearate Succinate, Plantain Enzyme, Capryl Gycol, Essential Oil Blend, Japanese Honeysuckle Extract\n\n\nSince the third ingredient is salicylic acid, I'm thinking about starting out trying that. Has anyone tried it on their scalp before? It's hard to tell how concentrated it is in the product, and I don't want to start using the 2% I use on my face and then totally freak out my scalp. As well, would spraying it on my scalp work well enough? \n\n\nAnd finally, are there any other ingredients on there that look worth trying? I know some people like neem oil a lot. I've tried TTO on my scalp, but I'm not sure if it worked or if the tingling just distracted me lol.",

I've been through so many hair care lines (tresemme when i first transitioned to natural 8 years ago, cantu, mielle organic and now currently using as i am) but since i had to hair styles back to back and not taking care of my hair due to being in my final year of university, i've had a lot of breakage and split ends. My hair does tend to grow fast due to genetics and also less manipulation but it also breaks a lot and split ends. my hair is shorter at the front and longer at the back\n\nhair routine currently:\n\n1. detangle using the as i am jamaican castor oil water spray\n2. wash my hair with as i am rosemary shampoo\n3. deep condition with africas best olive and shea oil conditioner mask, as i am rosemary conditioner, jamaican castor oil and amla oil\n4. blow dry my hair using fantasize carrot oil moisturiser and schwarzkopf got2b heat protectant\n5. use as i am leave in conditioner\n\nthe only part of my routine im 100% sure about is my deep conditioning bc my hair comes out so soft but it happens anytime i swap out the second conditioner for something else so i think my hair just reacts really well with the africas best conditioner mask.\n\nI don‚Äôt mind any price for products as long as theyre available in the UK/can be shipped to the UK",

My ND wanted me to try Shea oil in the nose to reduce inflammation so I randomly thought to try it on my bum. Seems it worked. I also did some suppositories so they could have helped but i think the ice cube was most helpful.",

My hair reacts poorly to anything with coconut or shea butter in it.  I have mostly 4B hair. If I had time, I'd list what I've tried that doesn't work, but I'm not near my bathroom's land of reject products bin. LOL. Off the top of my head, pun unintended, I remember not liking Miss Jessies', Shea Moisture Smoothie and Curling Gel/pudding, Curls brand and Mixed Chicks.  It's like $12 - $20 a pop everytime you try a new product, so it gets frustrating to have to start over. I already lost my leave in conditioner!\n\nDoes anybody have any similar recommendations for hair that hates stuff with coconut or shea oil in it?  I think my hair likes aloe, polyquaternium, and some other stuff. \n\nThanks!",

    "body": "The Shave Den Signature Scent Aftershave Milk Review\n\nI feel like I need to write this review because this artisan doesn't get enough press outside the shaving forum that bears it's name. This aftershave is the real deal. I like the short list of easily pronounceable ingredients:\n\nHydrosol Blend (Rose, Hibiscus, Jasmine), Jojoba Oil, Water, Witch Hazel, Shea Butter, Lecithin, Allantoin, Vitamin E, Glycerin, Aloe Vera, Potassium Sorbate, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid\n \nI was particularly attracted to the Shea butter and jojoba oil, since I've had great results with those in my journey into wet shaving already. The artisan offers an astonishing level of customization, allowing your choice of over a dozen scents and blends, with or without added menthol.  The scent I chose was TSD Signature - a blend of bergamot and bay rum, and it is one of my favorites. Bergamot adds a warm citrus and depth to the scent. I am almost out of it, so the hard part will be which scent to choose next time, or to just stay with what I know I like. The scent last as long as most other aftershaves... A few minutes strong, then a few whiffs here and there for the next few hours.  \n\nThis is a milk, and that is an apt description of the consistency.  It looks and acts like a splash, but with much better skincare.  It absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy going on or upon dry down. The bottle comes with a flow limiter that helps me not use too much at a time.  Not much is needed, so the $15 price is a good value. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this aftershave without reservation.  The custom scent choices means that if you end up not liking the scent, it's mostly your fault. :) I think everyone would love the skin care. It plays well with my mild rosacea, and leaves my skin feeling great all day. \n\nPackaging: 9/10 for the clear glass bottle with flow control dispenser\nScent: 10/10 - excellent scent - bergamot and bay rum\nSkincare: 9/10 - witch hazel and Shea oil among other face friendly ingredients",

I chopped my mane 2 years ago & I am in the painful process of growing it back out. I have **always** used 'curly girl approved' drugstore products for my entire routine - like Shea Moisture, John Frida, Not Your Mother's etc. They all worked perfectly but I have been trying to r/ZeroWaste, so I switched those for natural products. My actual routine has been the same **FOR YEARS**: I co-wash (using prayer hands technique), and scrunch-dry with an old t-shirt outside of the shower, scrunch-dry my gel into semi-dry hair.\n\nSo, I switched over to haircare bars from my local shop! I used this shampoo & conditioner.. the makeshift pair were amazingly for three months. I was hesitant to use them because they contained sodium ***coco*** sulfate.. I know that SLS is the devil of curly hair, but I thought I'd be safe with this natural sulfate.\n\nRecently, they have been leaving my hair feeling dry and feeling like straw... my hair has absolutely no life. I am afraid this change is because of the natural sulfate in the bars, despite the conditioner being 'specifically for curly hair'. I don't know what to do next... does anyone know any organic/natural hair products to use? Should I just go back to drugstore stuff?\n\n[Shampoo ingredients:](https://www.gabeandangel.com/product-page/the-hydrator-shampoo-conditioner-1) sodium coco sulfate, coconut oil, cocoa butter, matcha green tea, french green clay,¬†shea oil, hemp seed oil, apricot seed oil, isosteareth, dimethicone copolyol, ichthammol, stinging nettle extract, and d-panthenol (essential oils of: peppermint, eucalyptus, rosemary,¬†cerdar wood, and bergamot)¬†\n\n[Conditioner bar:](https://www.gabeandangel.com/product-page/the-hydrator-shampoo-conditioner)¬†behentrimonium methosulfate (from rapeseed oil), cetearyl (natural emulsifier and conditioner), cocoa butter, shea butter, olive oil, cetyl, coconut oil, glycerin, jojoba oil, wheat germ oil,¬†sweet almond oil,¬†d-panthenol, organic aloe vera, cyclomethicone, and vitamin¬†E (essential oils of: coriander seed, juniper berry, sweet orange, palmarosa, geranium, cardamom, and patchouli)",

In addition, since you aren't doing great, this may br a problwm for you. But Dimethicone copolyol is water soluable, so the shampoo bar is ok!\n\nNow, since you have been using a sulfate, it probably hasn't built up too badly. But I think you are proving the case in favor of the CG method.\n\nThere are many organic/natural products to use, but you still have to be a little careful. Giovanni is a trused natural haircare producer, and many of their products are CG friendly, but many aren't. Take a look at their website. They have many new lines to try. Plug the ingredients into www.isitcg.com to double check if it is ok. If you see something you like, but are still unsure, post here to see get opinions, if any. There are others.\n\nYou said you want to be zero waste. But perhaps for now a compromise would be to recycle through Terracycle.",

    "body": "Making lotion from scratch is a fun project. The process includes emulsifying water and oils, much like making soap. Other additives such as extracts, vitamin E and DL-panthenol can also be added to increase benefits to the skin. If you love the feel of homemade lotion but don‚Äôt want to formulate it yourself, the [Bramble Berry Lotion Bases](http://www.brambleberry.com/Lotion-Bases-C16.aspx) are here to help! These pre-made bases are ready to customize with scent and color.\n\nThe lotion bases come in four varieties: [Aloe Lotion Base](http://www.brambleberry.com/Aloe-Lotion-Base-P5584.aspx), [Basic Lotion Base](http://www.brambleberry.com/Basic-Lotion-Base-P6243.aspx), [Beeswax Lotion Base](http://www.brambleberry.com/Beeswax-Lotion-Base-P3717.aspx) and the [Shea Body Butter](http://www.brambleberry.com/Shea-Body-Butter-P5886.aspx). The main ingredient for all the bases is water; what makes them different are the types of oil, extracts and other ingredients such as emulsifiers. All the bases include the preservative optiphen to prevent mold and bacterial growth. To learn more about preservatives and how to us them, [check out this blog post](http://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/lotion/talk-it-out-tuesday-preservatives/). Check below to see the ingredients of each base!\n\nLotion Bases Ingredients:\n\n* [Aloe Lotion Base](http://www.brambleberry.com/Aloe-Lotion-Base-P5584.aspx): *Water, Aloe Vera Juice, Avocado Oil, Rice Bran Oil, BTMS-50, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Oat Extract, DL Panthenol, Optiphen (Preservative), Buckthorn Extract, Vitamin E*\n\n* [Beeswax Lotion Base](http://www.brambleberry.com/Beeswax-Lotion-Base-P3717.aspx): *Water, Sweet Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, BTMS-50,  Glycerin, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Stearyl Alcohol, Beeswax, Optiphen, Vitamin E, Hydroxyethylcellulose*\n\n* [Basic Lotion Base](http://www.brambleberry.com/Basic-Lotion-Base-P6243.aspx): *Water, Sweet Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, BTMS-50,  Glycerin, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Stearyl Alcohol, Beeswax, Optiphen, Vitamin E, Hydroxyethylcellulose*\n\n* [Shea Body Butter](http://www.brambleberry.com/Shea-Body-Butter-P5886.aspx): *Water, Rice Bran Oil, BTMS-50, Avocado Oil, Coconut Oil, Glycerin, Shea Oil, Stearyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Chamomile Extract, Preservative, Vitamin E Oil*\n\nWhich base is right for you? First, consider the texture. If you‚Äôre looking for a rich thick product, the Shea Body Butter Base or Beeswax Lotion are good options. If you prefer a thinner texture, the Basic Lotion Base or the Aloe Lotion Base have a lighter feel. Keep in mind that the texture may also affect how you package your product; thicker lotions are best in a jar or squeeze bottle, while thinner products can be put into a pump style bottle.\n\nThese lotion bases can be used as is, or customized with color and fragrance. To customize, place the lotion base into a disinfected container (5% bleach water or rubbing alcohol will disinfect your mixing containers). Heat the base to about 130 ¬∞F, but no hotter than 176 ¬∞F. If the base gets too hot, the preservative (optiphen) in the base begins to degrade. Once the base has been heated, the consistency will change to a melted milkshake texture.\n\nHeating the base to create a thinner texture makes fragrance and color easier to mix in‚Ä¶with one exception. The Aloe Lotion Base is the thinnest of all the bases and does not require heating before adding fragrance or color. But, if you prefer to heat the Aloe Lotion Base before customizing, you certainly can! Check out the [Burnt Sugar Shimmer Lotion Tutorial](http://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/lotion/burnt-sugar-shimmer-lotion/) for step by step instructions on how to use the Aloe Lotion Base.\n\nOnce the base has been heated, add your fragrance or essential oil in the recommended usage rate; find out the correct amount to add with the [Fragrance Calculator](http://www.brambleberry.com/Pages/Fragrance-Calculator.aspx). Stick blend in the fragrance or essential oil thoroughly and place in your container. A stick blender is the best thing to create a homogenous product. Once the lotion has been stick blended for several minutes, pour the mixture into your container and allow the mixture to fully cool without the cap to allow condensation to escape.\n\nTo add color, heat the product as directed above. The best colorant options for lotion are [LabColors](http://www.brambleberry.com/LabColors-C171.aspx) or [micas](http://www.brambleberry.com/Micas-C46.aspx). Diluted LabColors will not leave any color on the skin when used in small amounts. LabColors go a long way, so just a few drops will give your lotion great color. To add micas to your lotion base, the powder can be added directly or dispersed in a small amount of lightweight liquid oil or fragrance oil to help it blend into the base easier. The particles of oxides and pigments are larger than micas, and do not mix in very well. This could cause your lotion be leave streaks of color on the skin. To learn more about micas, check out the [Sunday Night Spotlight: Micas blog post](http://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/tips-and-tricks/sunday-night-spotlight-mica-colorants/). Curious about LabColors? [Check out this post!](http://www.soapqueen.com/bramble-berry-news/back-better-ever-labcolors/)\n\nAll of the lotion bases are formulated to accept up to about 5% of additional oils, extracts, or fragrances by weight, including small amounts of silicones like cyclomethicone. This is because the lotions have an emulsifier surplus, meaning there is more BTMS-50 in the lotion than needed, ready to mix in extra oils. Adding water based products like aloe vera gel or hydrosols do not need additional emulsifier. They will, however, thin your lotion and still need to be stick blended in.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a fun way to incorporate lotion bases into other products, the [Lotion Melt and Pour Cubes](http://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/melt-and-pour-soap/12-days-christmas-lotion-melt-pour-cubes/) are easy to make and skin-loving. Aloe Lotion Base is heated and added directly to melted melt and pour soap. The soap is customized further with LabColors and fragrance oil, then swirled together into cubes. Adding lotion base to melt and pour does cut down on the lather, but adds extra moisture.\n\nMaking lotion is fun, but if you prefer working with a tried and true recipe, the Lotion Bases are great. To learn more about lotion making, including frequently asked lotion questions, check out the [Talk it Out Tuesday: Lotion blog post](http://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/lotion/talk-it-out-tuesday-all-things-lotion/). \n\n**Source: [Soap Queen](http://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/tips-and-tricks/sunday-night-spotlight-lotion-bases/)**",

Might do wonders for your Oral Sex life. Ha Ha I've found that if I forget to apply for a day that it still is working the next day. My recipe uses Baking Soda but to some the baking soda can be irritating so just replace with more Arrow Root.\n\nAcquiring the material is easy I've included links to where I bought everything on Amazon. No I do not receive any referral fees/renumeration from Amazon. Feel free to do your own shopping. Just the title is Easy Peasy and Easy Peasy is not spending hours trying to find the equipment and ingredients.\n\nI used to do the double boiler method and stir with a whisk but I figured there must be a better way. I experimented and found that you could use a Pyrex Measuring cup and heat in Microwave instead of inside a boiling pot which is messy and more time consuming then use a frother to mix well.\n\nI make in larger batches and the results is a cream that I use inside of 8 Oz Glass Jars(Partially Filled). For the scent I only use Rosemary Essential Oil because not only does it have a nice smell but it is also Antimicrobial. I never use tea tree because I've found that with constant exposure Tea tree becomes irritating.\n\nHow to make it:\n\nUsing a Pyrex Measuring Cup as the mixing bowl, l melt the Solid Oils in a Microwave. Both Shea Butter and Coconut oil come in solid form. I add the 5 Oz of Shea Butter first melt it than add the Coconut Oil and continue to melt in the microwave until clear. Both combined will come out to 10oz melted. No need to boil, it adds a degree of dangerwhen you deal with Boiling liquids. Just not necessary.\n\nNow I add all the Powders one by one, Mixing after each powder is added. I use a cheap ($6.00)handheld Frother¬†[Here¬†](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Milk+frothers&i=garden&crid=3KFLG2QHCPCW0&sprefix=milk+frothers%2Cgarden%2C152&ref=nb_sb_noss_1), and mix real well. After powders are mixed in I add the Rosemary Oil and the Squeeze of Vitamin E. Vitamin E is optional but it also has Antimicrobial properties so I add it too. Then Mix Again.  \nPour the mixture into Clear Glass Jars¬†[Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086BM56X7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)¬†After which I refrigerate to harden. After leaving the Refrigerator and returning to room temperature it turns into a cream and you just apply cream from the Jars.\n\nVery little mess, muss and fuss.\n\n5OZ Shea Oil¬†[Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C4QBXA8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n5Oz Coconut Oil Virgin¬†[Here](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Body-Foods-Organic-Coconut/dp/B00IVJA7XW/ref=dp_fod_sccl_2/130-0773554-5701720?psc=1)  \n1 Cup of Arrowroot Powder¬†[Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082DL13SC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n1/4 Cup Zinc Oxide Powder¬†[Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HN69K0Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n1/4 Cup Baking Soda Powder Any  \nSqueeze of Vitamin E in Oil¬†[Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061GINBA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n5-7 droppers of Rosemary.¬†[Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08ZLLB1QP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n\nFound the original recipe (Small Batch) at Healthy Maven titled \"DIY Natural Deodorant‚Ä¶That Actually Works!\" it's against the rules to post a link so you'll have to search it up Below is the small batch recipe from the site.\n\nOriginal Small Batch Recipe\n\n2 1/2 tbsp unrefined coconut oil\n\n2 1/2 tbsp unrefined shea butter\n\n1/4 cup arrowroot starch/flour\n\n1 1/2 tbsp baking soda\n\n6 drops lavender essential oil\n\n6 drops grapefruit essential oil\n\n1 drop tea tree essential oil (optional)\\*",

I only put lotion on my face. Then I stay in for the night. If I know I'm going back out I apply lotion only. But I keep reading about how oils apparently make it worse? By keeping heat in.

And if just lay next to a fan, I wasn't even warm.\n\nMy real question is I guess, is just how bad for my skin is this?

They don't actually work.  They are propped up by industry funded \"scientific\" studies which are rigged to show positive results.  Moisturizing does something that people can notice.  Niacinamide might do something that you'll notice.  None of the rest will and certainly not in combination.",

    "body": "We were together almost 7 years. 3 years ago we moved out here to NYC, she made new friends. Gym friends specifically. Got really into the things they enjoy doing, drinking and partying, I kept becoming more successful in my business I‚Äôm building and dedicated myself to that and part time jobs with my time.\n\nI didn‚Äôt make any friends out here in the 3 years we were here. Only business acquaintances and clients. Success was all that mattered to me. Making a life that worked for us was all that mattered. I was happy because I had her.\n\nShe took on the majority of the expenses. We balanced her high paying corporate job with my slowly growing business that has a lot of long term potential. I was already landing multi-thousand dollar jobs. Last December I landed my first job over $4,000 and I ran around the house ecstatic. I cried because of how much work it took to get there. How many personal barriers I had to break. I came from a poor background with a lot of other adversities, I had to process a lot of trauma that kept me up at night from my past, and I also have always had bad ADHD.\n\nBut eventually she told me she felt like she didn‚Äôt truly know who she was, and that she needed space. She said ‚ÄúI believe in your success, but I don‚Äôt want to be there to see it happen.‚Äù\n\nHer 50+ year old male PT who only trains women was running her life from what I could see, and they would regularly spend an extra hour in his car in front of our apartment talking after every workout. She would come home parroting his words, talking about women always having to raise man children. He would give her homework to watch these hour+ long religious preaching videos about different topics, typically the ones where they just yell. She watched all of them because he said so, and she was never religious. He took up all her spare time, even in our own home.\n\nShe told me I didn‚Äôt put her in her place enough. She said this man changed her life. She said he taught her how to deal with her emotions and that ‚Äúemotions are a choice.‚Äù She started treating our love with the same ideas.\n\nThis is another aspect to the story, but she had been getting full body deep tissue oil massages at his house without telling me for months. She said she also massaged him. She said she didn‚Äôt tell me because of how i would react. She even continued doing it on weekends after seeing how much it bothered and hurt me. She came home smelling like shea oil and I remember her trying to be intimate smelling like that, and I was so turned off. I rolled over and said I wasn‚Äôt feeling like it that night. She didn‚Äôt have to tell me where she‚Äôd been all day.\n\nShe said it was for educational purposes and that she looked forward to massaging me at home. She did a few times, but it always felt wrong.\n\nShe started going on trips with him and ‚Äúhis girls‚Äù and went to Miami with them and then a solo trip with just him and her to the Dominican Republic.\n\n\nI really don‚Äôt think she knew how much I loved her. We had both proposed to each other to get married  in 2018. In my eyes she was everything I ever wanted regardless of where we were, or financial circumstances or anything. She was the one I needed to be with, and I would have done anything. Or at least the old version of her was. I pushed my body and mind to the brink working to try to make her happy during our last months. I never could. She preferred to live without me.\n\nDid you really love me? Maybe I was just what you had. Not what you wanted. I had my issues, but so did you. I thought our love was stronger than this.\n\nI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs not masculine to express the depths of these feelings. Why should I lie about having loved someone so passionately and seeing them suddenly and easily throw us away..?\n\n‚ÄúI realized something while we‚Äôve been apart. We aren‚Äôt compatible. Forget about me. Live your life.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs been half a year. Everyday has been hell. After this experience I‚Äôll never feel open again. My heart is locked.",

It recommended:\n\nShampoo: fermented rice water (for smoothing), jasmine flower water (antioxidants), and silk proteins\nConditioner: fermented rice water, argan oil, avocado oil, shea oil, coconut oil, and karanja oil\nLeave-in Conditioner: hyaluronic acid, collagen, and fermented rice water again\n\nSo can anyone recommend, for example, a good shampoo that is generally high in antioxidants and protein? Has anyone tried purchasing a really bare-bones conditioner and adding all the various oils themselves? I‚Äôve noticed skincare has experienced a trend toward awareness of what the active ingredients are and not being wooed by lots of fragrances and marketing gimmicks. Is there a trend out there in the hair care world?",

    "body": "So the last year I had some issues with my BM but it was odd since I had a high fiber nutrient rich diet! What could be causing constipation? I thought it was a muscle dysfunction of some sort but... it turns out I was taking a lot of supplements and meds that contain microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). The MCC was literally bulking my poop. Lesson learned! but..\n\nNow I have an internal hemorrhoid that you can see and feel a little from the outside. Its dark blue. There was no pain during todays BM but a few hours later it felt like I had a cut on the anus so I investigated. Now I feel it when I walk. I have Prep. H Lidocaine cream and suppositories that contain cocoa butter and  phenylephrine. I just tried putting on some Shea oil that I have since it is known to shrink tissue. Anything I should try??",

    "body": "Hi! Today I am getting about a foot chopped off of my hair and beginning the process of healing and appreciating my natural curly texture! I know curls are fragile and there are tips like for sleep you should use a silk wrap, for putting it up you should use a gentle scrunchie or clip it, but what about when you go to the gym? \n\nI workout 4-5 times/week and also play soccer, and I am concerned not only about how to hold my hair so it stays out of my face during these activities without damaging the curls, but also what that activity/sweat level is going to mean for my washing process. \n\nAny tips and advice is appreciated! \n\n(Don't know if this info will be useful to answer this post but here are my hair details atm: my hair right now is a little longer than waist length and I intend to get it cut around my shoulders, possibly with bangs. The current ends are bleached and dyed but that will be getting cut off. I have been using the Balance bar shampoo and conditioner from packagefreeshop for many months now, although I occasionally use my boyfriends Head & Shoulders and a Living Proof brand of deep conditioner. With my hair at its current length my hair is more wavy than anything, but when it has been short in the past it is definitely curly but very frizzy because I never bothered to use any products on it at all and let it air dry. From the hair type assessments I have taken, it seems as though my hair may fall into the 3A-C category, but will hopefully get a more definitive answer once its cut!) \n\nPS- these are the listed ingredients for the shampoo bar I use per the website: Sodium coco sulfate, coconut oil, cocoa butter, jojoba oil, calendula, shea oil, hemp seed oil, apricot seed oil, (essential oils of: sweet orange, neroli, and palmarosa), d-panthenol, turmeric, and hydrolyzed quinoa protein.",

Don‚Äôt tug your hair too much a really tight pony also hurts your hair. I like to try and have my curls survive after a workout when I put it down so I keep it pretty loosely tied and it‚Äôs fine for me but, you run a lot in soccer so maybe you can‚Äôt be so loose. That‚Äôs why cloth hair ties are so great it‚Äôs less damaging \n- I wear my hair in a loose pineapple bun or pony :) or braids help.\n- with bangs you may want some cloth headbands or get some hair pins or clips to braid or pull back your bangs from your face\n- when you get your hair cut be sure to tell them that once it shrinks back dry it needs to be long enough for you to tie it up \n\nPost workout - when I gotta rush\n- I take a body shower after I sweat and keep my hair up and basically let the steam dampen my hair. If I need more damp I use a spray bottle with water and spritz it a bit. \n- I put gel in with water in my spray bottle so it acts like a gel spray. but you can also use the prayer hands method and kinda run some product thru semi damp hair too. I take a travel size gel with me in my gym bag lol\n- Voila curls are a bit more fresh without having to totally redo your hair!\n\nPost workout - when I have more time to get ready or I sweat a lot\n- so I wash my hair more than most on this sub do.. Caveat: My hair isn‚Äôt really dry, it‚Äôs  really healthy. So sometimes I wash my hair like 3-4x a week due to workouts  but what I use to wash is different\n- once a week is my ‚Äúhair reset‚Äù wash I do, with my full shampoo and conditioner routine, trying to clarify my scalp from product buildup etc\n- the rest of the week if it‚Äôs just to feel clean after a heavy workout I use strictly cowash. It helps me get rid of that itchy scalp from dried sweat and I can detangle my hair a bit (it always tangles when I put it up). But not as stripping to my hair as the full shampoo and conditioner.\n- I like Curlsmith cowash for most of the week. For the reset wash I rotate using Devacurl no-poo and a Curlsmith deep condish OR Olaplex products because I bleached my hair.\n\n\nWish I could tell you about brushes but I have no need to use one‚Ä¶ I only ever brush and detangle with my fingers or mayyyybe a wide tooth comb in the shower.",

Maybe it helps someone.    \nPics of my skin.    \nhttps://imgur.com/a/7-mins-on-treadmill-JrfOkah   \n- - - - - - \nTLDR, Long Covid symptoms getting worse past 2 years, thought it was looking more like MCAS/HIT. Since October 2024 breaking out in painful rashes with High histamine foods and any internal heating like exercise/emotions. If I do 4-6 Box jumps I get itchy, If I do 4 pullups I get itchy. I used to do DB presses with 45-50 lbs 3-4 sets. Now I'm doing 20-25 lbs, 1 set. 15-20 reps so it doesn't get triggered. I have to keep physical effort at like 50-70% max.    \n  \n**Question 1**   \nWill continuing to exercise, pushing myself till the rashes come make things worse, like sensitizing myself to it? Should I stop once I get the rash? Or push through it if possible? (Essentially is this something to endure or avoid, should I be taking antihistamines when I work out or will that just cause dependency later)        \n    \n**Question 2**  \n**Did any of the typical MCAS medications like Cromolyn, Ketotifen help?**\n**Did any of the below supplements help you? (Info is from the 3rd link I posted at the bottom)**  \n1) The ‚ÄúA‚Äù Team    \nQuercetin  ‚Äì 2000 mg daily, dose divided  \nGreen tea (EGCG, L-Theanine) ‚Äì 2 to 3 cups daily.

However, I take [Histablock](https://a.co/d/40BU4MY) (Nettle Leaves, Quercetin, Butter Orange Fruit, and Bromelain) every morning and while that doesn‚Äôt make my hives disappear, it does help with the itch. \n\nUnsolicited advice: I‚Äôve had CIU since 2021. I‚Äôve met with countless doctors all at Mayo Clinic in the US. They all prescribed me different medicines, some of which I still take regularly. It wasn‚Äôt until I coupled that medicine with a functional approach that my hives calmed down. I met with an integrative medicine dr at Mayo Clinic who started me on the elimination diet (can link the one she prescribed if you want) and specific supplements for my gut. She also prescribed me regular acupuncture, which helps a ton with the joint pain I experience with CIU. \n\nThanks for sharing the links! Hope you find some relief from this disease - it sucks.",

Lots of flakiness too \n\nBeen treated for psoriasis by the GP,\n Dovobet for 4 weeks > 4 weeks of Calcipotrio 50mg >8 weeks dovobet > 4 weeks just moisturisers, then Enstilar for 4 weeks. This helped a bit but nothing major. Had Flucloxacillin 500mg also because they though it could be infection but didn't change anything.\n\n\nDermatologist thought it could be a fungal infection so had 3 months of Terbinafine 250mg and Miconazole 2% cream. Just got worse. \n\nAll blood tests and swabs have come back normal.\n\n\nBeen on a deit of just green veg and chicken for months. Also taking vitamins ( though my levels were fine said it won't hurt) \n\nThe best thing I found was on holiday I just sat in the sun for 5 days using factor 50 sun cream and raw shea oil as moisturiser and saw the best improvement, Though my Dermatologist as said having light treatment wouldn't help? \n\nI'm currently on 4 weeks \"rest\" before my next dermatologist appointment. But its driving me crazy. \n\nAnyone got any ideas or anything I could try?",

    "body": "I‚Äôm the only person in my living family with curls and mine are especially thick and hard to manage. I live in the UK. For the past 2 years I‚Äôve just been using Maui moisture shampoo / conditioner and Shea moisture leave in products and hair masques. However im trying to reduce the amount of artificial products I put in my hair, and I want to use more organic things or oils or whatever. \n\nI tried coconut oil very recently and it worked so well, it moisturised my hair perfectly in a way I‚Äôve NEVER seen before I was shocked at how good it turned out however within a couple hours I noticed that it smelled a bit funny. I washed the minor excess out and a day later it still sort of smells weird. I really liked the effect it had on my hair, I‚Äôve tried amla oil and shea oil and things of that nature and they‚Äôve never really done it for me but coconut oil was a life changer. The only problem is the smell.\n\nI‚Äôve seen online that you can combine essential oils with coconut oil to make it more fragrant but I‚Äôm not sure exactly how to do that, or what to pair with it in a way that will achieve the same goal but also mask the smell. Alternatively, if there are any other oils that achieve the same effect or have similar properties with less of a pungency I‚Äôd happily try those too.\n\nMy entire family has 1c to 2a hair except for my paternal grandfather who has passed away and my dad who is bald and never took care of his curls anyway. I have no family hair care system at all so everything I‚Äôve done is trial and error, so any tips on a routine or system would be massively beneficial too üôèüèæüôèüèæ",

    "body": "**Previous Routine**\n\nMorning:   \nNeutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser (Had been using for 17 years and my skin started rejecting it when the formula was changed)  \nCeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n\nShea Moisture 100% Pure Shea Oil\n\nVaseline\n\nNight: \n\nRarely washed my face because I'm lazy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was unhappy with my texture. I was super dry, my moisture barrier was shot, and my skin felt tight and was flaky. I was concerned about orange peel texture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New Routine**\n\nMorning:\n\nPalmer's Skin Therapy Cleansing Oil\n\nShea Moisture 100% Pure Shea Oil\n\nCeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNight:\n\nGarnier Micellar Cleansing Water *(Possibly removing once empty)*\n\nHada Labo Tokyo Hydrating Facial Cleanser *(Possibly removing once empty)*\n\nPalmer's Skin Therapy Cleansing Oil\n\nStridex Pads Red Box (every other day)\n\nDickenson's Witch Hazel (t-zone)\n\nThe Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution\n\nTruSkin Vitamin C\n\nHada Labo Skin Plumping Gel\n\nShea Moisture 100% Pure Shea Oil\n\nThe Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 or Cosmedica Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nVaseline\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpot Treat:\n\nClean and Clear Advantage Acne Spot Treatment\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nMy skin needs salicylic acid to stay clear. I tried removing the Neutrogena Cleanser and I was not happy with the increase in breakouts and blackheads that progressively got worse. I just introduced the Stridex pads and they did wonders in just one night with active breakouts. I know using Glycolic Acid and Salicylic Acid together is a no-no, but the Glycolic Acid isn't addressing my breakouts yet is doing wonders for my skin. Maybe I should move the pads to the morning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like how the Garnier Micellar Water removes my makeup, but it is slightly irritating. It really isn't great for removing my mascara. I may remove this altogether when it runs out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Hada Labo Tokyo Hydrating Facial Cleanser is nice, but it also feels very soapy/drying. I probably won't repurchase this, but I'm looking for recommendations for a hydration cleanser replacement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution is great. I truly think it has done wonders for reducing blackheads and sebaceous filaments. DO NOT LET THIS GET NEAR YOUR UNDEREYE SKIN. Let it dry completely before starting another step. It straight up burned under my eye and that sucked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Hada Labo Skin Plumping Gel is awesome. I love the way this feels on my skin and it is super hydrating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 is eh. I don't like how sticky it is, which makes layering hard. I prefer the Cosmedica Hyaluronic Acid Serum, but don't know which is more effective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI prefer having an in depth routine at night and going simple in the morning. It also doesn't change how my makeup sits. My skin is looking much better thus far. More hydrated and supple. It just feels better. I still have pores and texture, but I'm starting to realize that's just fucking skin and Facetune isn't real-life. No change in the undereye bags and darkness though, and still hoping for the under eye wrinkles to start seeing an improvement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuggestions? Thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Sadly these products don't support curly hair. I tried sticking it out and not washing my hair too often. I started with every other day and my scalp just went insane. If I don't wash my hair daily my scalp get super oily and flakey (I've tried everything for seborrhec dermatitis/dandruff without improvement). I have to use the tea tree oil shampoo at least once a week to calm things down. I apply shampoo to only the roots, condition everything after that and try not to wash all of the conditioner out. I tried using Shea oil to hydrate the end of my hair but it didn't really help. I currently am using Garnier leave in conditioner on the ends of my hair because hopefully it's better than nothing. I have tried a few deep conditioning masks (apply and work around the house with a shower cap on for an hour) and they work AMAZINGLY until tomorrow when I wash my hair and I'm back to square one. Basically I end up usually trying a product, it wreaks havoc on my scalp and then it going in the garbage. Does anyone else have this issue, do you have any advice on getting started? Are there any cheaper lines that work well that I won't feel terrible about throwing away? Is there a way to have less frizzy curls and not wash everyday? I'm willing to try!",

This summer, my persistent hormonal acne sent me to the dermatologist. \n\nI saw the derm in July, and she prescribed me .05% Trentinoin cream, from which I experienced two or three months of angry purging and flaking around my jaw. I also began 50 mg daily of Spironolactone, from which I have experienced no negative side effects.\n\nBefore (July photo): Hormonal acne around the jaw, (occasionally on forehead) and a lot of PIH. This photo does not really do it justice; I rarely experienced more than a few days without an active break-out.\n\nIn September, I visited the derm a second time, and since I was still experiencing active pimples, she put me on one round of Minocycline. I think that really helped clear all the active hormonal cysts.\n\nMost recent (November photos): No active break-outs, fading of PIH. The purging seems to have ceased. I experience pretty regular flaking for several days after each application of Trentinoin, but I am figuring out new ways to manage that. \n\nRoutine:\nAM: Splash face with water, apply Cosrx Snail 96 Serum (let dry), then apply La Roche-Posay Double Repair Moisturizer SPF 30. \nFor work days, I then apply Naked Skin Ultra Definition Liquid Foundation or Dewy Smooth Fit Me Maybelline Foundation. I generally apply a setting powder on top of that.\n\nPM: Cleanse with Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser. \nThree times a week: Let face dry for approximately 30 minutes, then apply pea-sized amount of Trentinoin cream all over the face, buffered with Clinique Moisture Surge Intense. I usually finish with a layer of Vaseline or a generic version of Aquaphor with lanolin. \nOther days of the week: apply a generous amount of Clinique Moisture Surge after cleansing, and follow with Vaseline/Aquaphor.\nI have experimented with Shea oil, but I am not entirely convinced of its efficacy. \n\nI would love to hear about other ways Trentinoin users are taking care of their skin. \n\nI'd also like to add that I am so grateful for SkincareAddiction, because it helped me stick it through the purging because I read so many others' accounts of their experience!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AcTAl",

I would only recommend for someone to exfoliate 3x per week max, and it seems like you‚Äôre doing it twice a day if I‚Äôm reading that right. \n\nI like the glycolic acid from The Ordinary, it‚Äôs cheap and works good. Or for a more gentle exfoliant, Krave has one called kale-lalu-yaha\n\nWhat kind of toner are you looking for? People use the word ‚Äútoner‚Äù to describe anything that has a watery consistency, but they all do different things. Are you looking for a hydrating toner? Or what are you looking for it to do? Toners aren‚Äôt really necessary if you don‚Äôt have a particular problem that can be solved through another product.\n\nAlso, moisturizers with SPF typically don‚Äôt actually work very well because you have to use a LOT of it to actually get the spf15 protection it boasts... and id recommend trying for at least spf30\n\nAlso the spinach kale cleanser from the brand Youth to the People is really good for removing all the makeup and oil from your face. Some people say it‚Äôs too stripping for them but I find it to be just right, and it sounds like you are looking for a cleanser that‚Äôs more on the stripping side anyway (but it‚Äôs very gentle)",

    "body": "Hi there! I apologize for the essay, but I need to set this up before I ask my question: sorry!\n\nI'm a licensed esthetician, and also until fairly recently I was also an esthetics instructor at a beauty school. However, when I started to get a weird itchy and painful rash on the inside of my left hand, I was completely stumped as to what was going on.\n\nJuly of 23 was when the symptoms first arose, and I was working a lot in my garden at the time. My thoughts were that I was either having some kind of an allergic reaction to something in the garden, or that I had developed contact dermatitis. However, I didn't understand how either could be true since I always wash my hands with regular soaps (as opposed to antibacterial) and followed with moisturizer, and have always been very careful to wear the proper PPE whenever I do anything. As the condition became worse, by August I was lucky enough to be able to see my PCP and was diagnosed with dyshidrotic eczema. Besides hormonal acne as a teen, this is the first skin condition I've ever been diagnosed with. \n\nI was prescribed a steroid cream, and for 6 weeks used it in strict accordance with my doctor's instructions, but it made my condition so much worse. My skin was dry, crepey, and painful, like it wasn't mine. It blistered (of course), cracked, bled, and practically glowed bright red. It felt like I'd put my hand through a window. My students were constantly asking me about it, as it was extremely visible. Without consulting with my doctor, I stopped using the prescription and started using pure shea oil. It didn't fix the condition of course, but it healed up and was less painful. \n\nAs I've learned more about dyshidrotic eczema, a few things have stuck out about it during my research: it often affects women over 40 (that's me, I just turned 40 in June), it typically appears in people enduring times of high stress (my dad passed away in July, and my job was extremely stressful), and for some reason medical science still doesn't know for sure what causes it. \n\nI've talked to my PCP more about this, and she has no more information for me about this condition. She prescribed me a probiotic which may have contributed to a small improvement in the condition. I told her that I've stopped using the prescription cream and she hasn't recommend another. Since then I've used a regimen which includes an over the counter eczema cream called The Ocean Healed My Eczema, along with pure shea oil and cannabis sativa oil. Many times since then, my hand has healed almost completely, and then the process would begin all over again. It breaks out, then mostly heals, then more blisters form, then my skin dries out and peels. It has never been as bad again as it was when I started using the steroid cream, but my hand is still red, blistered, and peeling. I try very hard not to scratch it when it itches, as that seems to make the breakout much worse. \n\nSo finally, the question! \n\nI'm also a licensed nail technician and happen to have a bottle of Footlogix Cream Mousse for Rough Skin at home. This is their formulation of their DD Cream foot care with the addition of 1% clotrimazole for the treatment of athlete's foot and similar conditions. I used it because it happened to be nearby and my hand was really dry, tight, and uncomfortable. But not only did I get instant relief, but I saw a physical improvement by the end of the day with one application. I've been continuing to use it and nothing else for days now, and I'm seeing a steady improvement.\n\nWas I misdiagnosed? Is this just a placebo effect? Or maybe dyshidrotic eczema is potentially caused by some kind of fungus? I am really interested in the thoughts of a medical professional. \n\nTl:Dr Was my dyshidrotic eczema diagnosis incorrect, or is this antifungal cream I've been using on it perhaps a missing puzzle piece in our understanding of this condition?",

Generally, I used a moisturizer like Jamaican Mango & Lime shea butter (pictured below) & a mixture of oils that I mix myself (olive oil, shea oil, black castor oil & teatree oil). I'll apply the moisturizer first & then spritz & rub the liquid oil into my scalp. \n\nThe problem I'm running into is, either my scalp is dry & flaky or I have oil running down the back of my neck & side of my head like I've got a damn jheri curl. I thought the shea butter was supposed to kinda \"anchor\" the oil to my scalp, but everytime I end up like a buttered biscuit; I thought maybe I was doing it too often, so I'd moisturize less frequently, only to end up flaking up a storm a couple days later. Am I using the wrong products? Am I moisturizing too often/not often enough? I use a spray bottle for the oil, so I'm not pouring 4 ozs of liquid onto my head. How do I find that happy, luxurious, healthy middle ground?\n\nThanks y'all!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2pd93m2qot51.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2e8fdc198ec04213552458b90c82a3829a6e65a",

I have a very dry scalp and the only thing that works for me is Jamaican black castor oil, and even with that I have to do it a couple times a week. You won't be able to spray it as it's thick, you'll have to use either a hair coloring bottle with a pointed tip or a bottle with a nozzle on it.\n\nAlso, moisturizer should be applied to your hair, not your scalp if that's what you were explaining. I won't tell you not to use the shea butter, but creamy moisturizers do leave build uo, so keep that in mind. A water-based spray is a good way to go, like rosewater and vitamin e oil.",

This protects your nails from unnecessary exposure to chemicals and excessive moisture.\n\nLooking for glove recommendations?

Discoloration, ridges, brittle nails, or slow growth could be signs of nutritional deficiencies, fungal infections, or other conditions. If you notice persistent problems, consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nAchieving and maintaining healthy nails requires a holistic approach, encompassing a balanced diet, proper care, protection, and recognizing potential issues.

If not, you've came to the right place.\n\nWe have a new product fresh from Ghana!\n\nAt TAMA Cosmetics, we¬†produce both shea butter and shea oil products. The major difference between shea butter and shea oil is the texture, one is butter and one is oil.\n\nOur TAMA Intensive Shea Oil for Hair Repair is special because it¬†contains baobab oil and sunflower oil, both high in essential fatty acids and vitamin E. These ingredients are vital for hair growth. This product will naturally detangle hair for an all-day glow, repair damaged hair, promote hair growth and sooth a dry and irritated scalp.¬†Known as hair fertilizer, it promotes hair growth and protects the scalp from dandruff keeping your hair healthy and shiny.\n\nTAMA Shea Oil for Body¬†contains¬†argan oil and baobab oil, which are great for dry skin and also serves as natural baby oil.

    "body": "Physical attraction is considered as one of the most important assets of every individual. Physical attractiveness includes body shape, height, hair type, weight, etc. Beauticians have led people to believe in standards so wrong that people feel uncomfortable in their own natural state. Speaking of hair in particular, people are naturally born with different hair types. This includes straight, curly, wavy, curly hair, and hair with many other textures and looks. In today's world, people, especially women, prefer shiny and straight hair over curly hair, believing that flat ironed locks are more acceptable. People often go to treatment to get permanent straight hair that can last longer. They find it difficult to style and maintain curly black hair. Regardless of hair type or length, they all need care. If not handled properly, they will start to fall off and the texture will crumble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zo6dj7r4avo71.jpg?width=2362&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f15152c67feda5aa76d525a78585b099eeff98e5\n\nToday, with everyone on the go, lovers of good hair tend to use easily accessible electric machines like presses, rollers and hair dryers to style and care for their hair, especially if it has black curls. They are more likely to straighten their hair almost every day, if not every day. You can style your hair however you like. You just need to take care of them because they deserve to be taken care of. Just as you need food and water to live, your hair also needs special products to keep it healthy and beautiful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the top 10 products for dark curly hair that will keep your hair healthy, nourished, and allow you to style it the way you want. From natural products to experimentally made products that keep hair healthy and smooth.\n\nCOCONUT OIL:\n\nCoconut oil is a natural hair remedy and is considered one of the most beneficial oils for dark curly hair. Not only does it restore shine, it makes hair stronger, shinier and softer. It promotes hair growth by being absorbed into the follicles.\n\nCREAM FOR DETERMINING MARKOK OIL:\n\nThis magical product uses heat-activated technology that keeps curls fresh and bouncy all day long. This cream is an absolute product to tame thick curly hair.\n\nSHEA OIL:\n\nShea butter is extremely moisturizing for hair, showing its best results on curly hair as it requires more moisture and less cleansing. If you want to get rid of dry hair, shea butter is here to save you.\n\nARGAN OIL:\n\n[Argan oil](https://cosmeticsweb.co.uk/products/100-pure-argan-oil-150-ml?_pos=4&_sid=d8afcb35a&_ss=r) naturally moisturizes curly black hair and reduces roughness. It helps prevent hair breakage by increasing hair elasticity. It has been shown to be a source of nutrition for the scalp and actively promotes hair growth.\n\nMRS JESSE'S PIPE IS VERY FRESH:\n\nThis spray is a combination of water and glycerin that revives natural black curls. It shapes and rehydrates hair as soon as you spray it on. It also adds shine to the hair and reduces frizz.\n\nOUIDAD CLIMATE CONTROL SHAMPOO:\n\nMoisture goes to curls, just like heat goes to ice. Moisture causes the cuticle to expand and swell, making it look rough and fuzzy. This shampoo has a unique anti-perm nanotechnology that uses silk proteins to protect it from moisture and block the hair's natural moisture. This shampoo also has a UV filter that protects hair from sun damage.\n\nAVEDA BE CURLY SHAMPOO:\n\nIt is a classic that has remained a constant in the world of frizz shampoos and surpasses all other products available today. It works to repair and clean curls. This is a great combination of wheat protein and organic aloe vera that sets the curl pattern.\n\nVERNON FRANCOIS CURL COMMAND SHAMPOO:\n\nVernon Francois has developed his own line of products for [Hair Care Treatment](https://cosmeticsweb.co.uk/collections/shea-butter) . The formula is sulfate-free and made from ingredients that nourish and moisturize hair, including luwak oil, coconut oil, and a dose of vitamins. It works to restore hair and protect curls from the scalp to the roots.\n\nJELLY FROM KRALA DEFINITION - GOOD WAY:\n\nJelly with curly definition of the good stuff is an alternative to cleansing treatments. It is very light and can be used quickly. As a result, curls don't feel heavy or crunchy, but look fresh and reduce frizz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCURL GLOSS BY FISH:\n\nIt is also called \"gel gloss\". Defines curls, moisturizes and gives an amazing shine. It has little to no crunch factor and makes a beautiful ring with minimal tearing. Many people like this to treat their curly black hair.",

    "body": "Question AND great info links at the bottom. Maybe it helps someone.    \nPics of my skin.    \nhttps://imgur.com/a/7-mins-on-treadmill-JrfOkah   \n- - - - - - \nTLDR, Long Covid symptoms getting worse past 2 years, thought it was looking more like MCAS/HIT. Since October 2024 breaking out in painful rashes with High histamine foods and any internal heating like exercise/emotions. If I do 4-6 Box jumps I get itchy, If I do 4 pullups I get itchy. I used to do DB presses with 45-50 lbs 3-4 sets. Now I'm doing 20-25 lbs, 15-20 reps so it doesn't get triggered. I can't do anything.  \n  \n**Question 1**   \nWill continuing to exercise, pushing myself till the rashes come make things worse, like sensitizing myself to it? Should I stop once I get the rash? Or push through it if possible? (Essentially is this something to endure or avoid, should I be taking antihistamines when I work out or will that just cause dependency later)        \n    \n**Question 2**  \n**Did any of the typical MCAS medications like Cromolyn, Ketotifen help?**\n**Did any of the below supplements help you? (Info is from the 3rd link I posted at the bottom)**  \n1) The ‚ÄúA‚Äù Team    \nQuercetin  ‚Äì 2000 mg daily, dose divided  \nGreen tea (EGCG, L-Theanine) ‚Äì 2 to 3 cups daily. Supplement with 500 mg (175 mg of ECGC) twice daily  \nCurcumin (Meriva is a common brand name) ‚Äì 1 to 4 g daily, dose divided  \nChamomile tea (Apigenin, luteolin) ‚Äì 1 to 2 cups before bed  \nResveratrol ‚Äì 20 mg twice daily  \nDiamine oxidase enzymes (DAO) ‚Äì 2 capsules with each meal  \nVitamin C ‚Äì may need a non-citrus source such as rose hips ‚Äì 1 to 3 g daily  \n2) The ‚ÄúB‚Äù Team  \nLuteolin ‚Äì 100 mg twice daily  \nGinkgo biloba ‚Äì 500 mg daily  \nSilymarin ‚Äì 500-1000 mg daily, doses divided  \nShea oil ‚Äì 3 capsules daily  \nEllagic acid ‚Äì 500 mg daily  \nPycnogenol ‚Äì 500 to 1000 mg daily  \nMagnolia/Honokiol ‚Äì 200 to 250 mg twice daily  \nParthenolide (Feverfew) ‚Äì 200 to 400 mg twice daily  \n  \n- - - - - \n1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hADkN7aCFb0  \nI just found this guy Dr. Paul Anderson yesterday and he has a lot of info on Histamine related issues.  \n2) https://www.botanicalmedicine.org/retraining-the-mighty-mast-cells-mast-cell-activation-syndrome-and-histamine-intolerance-revisited/  \n3) https://www.drbrucehoffman.com/post/mast-cell-stabilizers",
