    "body": "Edit: Hi you guys!! i did not realize this post is the #1 result on google SEO when you search sulwhasoo reviews!! I have an updated post out now if you wanna check it, and my instagram is also @lonelyblep if you wanna ask questions there because Reddit i so bad at notifying me about your messages lul\n\nHello you guys I am back with another total brand guide, this time for Sulwhasoo. Many of you have requested one for Sulwhasoo ever since I did the one for Whoo. And I am happy to tell you that I know Sulwhasoo VERY WELL. As a skincare curator I always try to seek out new and innovative products for my clients to try, and Sulwhasoo is good old and reliable every time, yet they still embrace innovation. So the basics about every line, you have 5 phases of skincare: cleansing, awakening (First Care Activating Serum EX), balancing (water and emulsion for water-oil balance before any serum or special product is applied, treatment (these are where your serums and creams go, and finish (Luminature Essential Finisher, sunscreen or a sleeping mask) Their system is different, emulsion goes right after toner instead of after all serums / ampoules like other brands. The system is the same for all skincare from AmorePacific apparently. \r\n Anyways let's cut the crap and get to the guide, also l am going to do a mini review of each product\r\n\n\r\n-Essential: Introduction series to Sulwhasoo, meant for skin that is slightly aging but not too much, and for those who have water – oil balance issues. It is also meant to have a glowing effect and is good for dry, combination and normal skin.\r\n\r\n+First Care Activating Serum EX: Their bestseller. You can easily see why it is. 5 Korean herbs that make up Jaumdan, the main ingredient in this serum help to improve skin on all aspects and help to just upgrade your skin. To me it is a life changing product. Use before toners but after actives. (A special Plum Blossom version of FCAS was launched in April and has real plum blossom extract and fragrance) \r\n\n+First Care Activating Serum Mist: A mist with the active ingredients of FCAS and a layer of olive oil on top for emollience. I like this on top of makeup because it makes my skin look glowing. \n\r\n+First Care Activating Mask: When the people love something so much, it's logical that you'll have a spin off of it. This mask is soaked up to one third of a bottle of FCAS with all the good stuff and no alcohol so you use this after FCAS since FCAS has alcohol and it's an absorption boosting agent. Also if you want the goodness of FCAS in times of skin compromise (compromised skin stings from the alcohol in FCAS) this should be perfect. Gives my skin a radiant glow, softness, smoothness and clarity in one application, something your Dermal or Mediheal masks can't do in one use #whenwillyourfave\r\n\r\n+Essential Balancing Water EX: Their bestselling toner for it's cheap price and effectiveness. This toner is thicker than most toners you'll see in Western beauty. It has a light herbal scent, signature to the Essential line. It hydrates to no end, if Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion is a 10, this is a 20 \r\n\r\n+Essential Balancing Emulsion EX: Their bestselling emulsion. I feel like oily skin would love this. I don't really. Because I feel like it's only as goood as the toner at moisurizing. But oily people swear by this, lightweight moisture that does not fuck around, plus some nice antioxidants. I heard Liah Yoo raving about AmorePacific’s The Essential Crème Fluid but I actually think iff you pack on 2-3 layers of this stuff you can get the same moisture as you with the Crème Fluid, not to mention it's almost twice as cheaper.\r\n\r\n+Essential Revitalizing Serum EX: I always recommend this serum for people who are starting to see the signs of aging or do not see it yet but want to prevent it. It is a fresh, light gel texture that packs a heavy moisture punch. Oily people love it, but it would definitely be enough for dry people like me as well (of course with moisturizer on top, I am not a savage). Definitely an investment type of product if you're just stepping into the world of luxury Korean skincare. I do not believe in drugstore brands but some people just have to make do with what they have, but having this serum would definitely help their routine more efficient. \r\n\r\n+Essential Revitalizing Eye Cream EX: The smell of this product is definitely different from the other products from the Essential line. It smells faintly of white ginseng, and not the signature earthy-sweet Sulwhasoo base scent. It is more of an emulsion really and it's good for people who are starting with eye cream because this thing can't create milia due to it's extremely thin texture.\r\n\r\n+Essential Firming Cream EX: A lovely texture shifting cream that melts from a thick and smooth cream to a light emulsion, wrapping your skin in Hanbang goodness. Oily people might want to avoid this but combo skin should be fine.  It does firm up really. \r\n\r\n-Ginseng: Their signature line that started in 2000. Their Ginseng cream is so popular it practically became legendary. The line had a total revamp in 2017 (revamp was completed in 2018 with addition of the new Ginseng serum) including packaging and formulation improvements. Essential does not work on wrinkles while Ginseng works on almost every facet of aging care: Wrinkles, Elasticity, Tone, Texture, and Density. To remove any confusion and further enhance the line, Sulwhasoo launched Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water and Emulsion.\r\n\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water: An oil like toner that provides intensive conditioning moisyure to the skin, resulting in increased elasticity and overall health. The toner is highly moisturizng, smoothing and oily people can use this as an essence step.\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Emulsion: It smells strongly  of ginseng (a characteristic of the line) and the texture is similar to the Timetreasure emulsion (which we will get to later). It is intensely moisturizing and some say it might be a dupe to the lightweight version of the Ginseng cream. I confirm this.\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Serum: A serum with Ginsenisphere ( a patented encapsulation technology in capsules that lies within the base for maximum protection of the antioxidants and immediate release upon the skin). The updated version I heard removed Macro Ginsenisphere, the visible beads in the serum. This serum feels just like it's predecessor, a stretchy gel that does not feel oily or tacky but still leaves a smooth film on your skin. A lot of my clients reported better elasticity and smoothness. There are mixed reviews from people who have tried it's predecessor. \n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Facial Oil: A facial oil containing real ginseng seed oil blended in a mix of highly stable skin friendly oils such as Squalane, Sunflower, Jojoba, Korean Pine, Sesame and Apricot to lock in the effects of the serum and acts as a powerful moisturizing product on it's own with anti oxidative properties. This oil is used after serum before cream. The old version has meadowfoam seed oil which I LOVE but it's gone  but anyways the new one is the same so AmorePacific got lucky that I didn't try to burn their HQ. Oh and this is my HG facial oil. Ps: The oil blends sound like they have way tooo much oleic acid so as much as I am an advocate for oily skin using facial oils, oily skin should stay away.\r\n\r\n+100% Ginseng Facial Oil: An ultra rare limited edition product that consisted of pure Ginseng seed oil grown by AmorePacific themselves. I could never get it tho \r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Eye Cream EX: The renewed version has a stronger ginseng scent with a creamier consistency. This eye cream spreads like a dream and diffuses wrinkles in a month. \r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX: The star product of the brand. Smells strongly of ginseng, so you might wanna be careful with this baby. It is richly moisturizing yet being too thin in texture for my liking. It also contains mostly Ginseng extract which is a powerful antioxidant. My clients who do other beauty procedures like laser resurfacing or dermarolling swear by this. I personally think the texture is too thin but maybe that's just me, you can't even make a soft peak with this cream. I love how it actually makes my skin stronger and help calm it down whenever I use actives (which I stopped long ago)\r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX Light: A lighter version of the OG ginseng cream for those with combination to oily skin or those who dislike the scent of ginseng. Some dedicated people have went as far as using this as a day cream with the original Ginseng cream at night. This smells like fresh ginseng flowers and has a lighter, fresher texture. I would not say it's a gel cream, it does still have a tackiness to it, but it moisturizes efficiently for me and does not cause breakouts for oily people. You technically get less ginseng extract per jar for the same price but technically you still get the same one-night-after miracle. It still calms skin down and have anti oxidative properties.\r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask: A mask contains 8 times the power of the ginseng cream, the sheet mask is doused inside the miraculously repairing ginseng cream and double wrapped with another occlusive layer on top . The mask CAN transform your skin completely if you have dry lackluster skin, just give it 20 minutes and then you’ll be amazed. Oily skin stay a mile away from this stuff.\r\n\r\n-Hydro Aid: For younger and oiler skin, meant to be used in conjunction with the Essential line. I think they made this line since they noticed their sales plummeted during summer :v\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Water: A Korea exclusive product I think. I can't say much about this.\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Cream: A lightweight gel cream, it smells super nice and provides abundant hydration. But I suppose you can get something cheaper for just hydration purposes alone. But it does smell amazing though.\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid UV Protection Cream: A good physical sunscreen that provides a nice amount of moisture with minimal white cast. But overall kind of boring?\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Mist: It smells amazing and hydrates like a dream. HG mist. \r\n\r\n-Snowise: Brightening line with anti aging effects that help increase collagen synthesis and brighten skin through the use of sexy ingredients like licorice and white ginseng saponins. It has a unique take on brightening, called Volume Brightening. It increases the volume / plumpness of your skin so it can reflect light better, something not any brightening product can do. The range smells like ginseng + herbs + pine forest.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Cleansing Foam: Every beauty blogger's hanbang bae. It's actually a lot of people's first love from Sulwhasoo. I mean pH 5.5, luxurious creamy foam, and a scent that is to die for. Plus it's one of Sulwhasoo's cheapest products. Of course it's an instant hit!\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Exfoliating Gel (New version: Snowise Brightening Exfoliationg Mask) : I thought I heard it wrong. An exfoliating product? From Sulwhasoo? And a physical exfoliant? “A scrub. “ I thought. I cringed at that word ever since two disasters named Lancome and St. Ives happened on my face in my pre AB years. But oh well, it is Sulwhasoo after all. The gel is stretchy and contains BETA GLUCAN *FANBOY SCREEECH* and the scrub particles are made from ground WHITE GINSENG *DOUBLE SCREECH* and walnut shell (this is the same shit is in that Equate scrub but whatever it's much more gentle in this scrub) The smell is vastly different from the rest of the line, it's a straight up white ginseng smell. The particles are so small I can't even feel like it's doing anything on my skin, but actually my skin became TRANSLUCENT every time I use this. I swear that this is the only physical scrub I will ever put on my skin. [This review is for the old product,  I have yet to try the new one] \n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Water: A fresh and light toner with brightening extracts. This is WAY too light for me, I do not feel like it is giving me moisture that actually lasts. But other other hand it actually really helped with my pores. I consider this like the holy water for large pores.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Serum: The bestseller of the line and the entire brand. This serum skips all that proven actives and just goes for the extracts, in true Sulwhasoo spirit. I was a bit skeptical at first but I FINALLY SAW THE LIGHT. It gave me a bright complexion that is so plump, moisturized and transparent no other brightening serum can give me. \r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Mask: I use this mask twice weekly on top of the serum to seal it in and fuse with my skin. My skin is noticeably brighter after just one box. And mind you, the effect is NOT temporary. I can tell because my friends ask me what BB Cream / Cushion I'm using but I said it's just my bare skin. THEY WERE SHOOOK. \n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Spot Treatment: This concentrated gel to water correcting spot treatment penetrates deeply and suppresses melanin. Although the claims weren't supported by any study whatsoever, I can see that my dark spots around my cheeks have disappeared, and my bigger spot faded slightly so I can see there's a definite change. I admit that I love bright, fair skin (not related to Asian standards at all, just preference) but I hate the spots and imperfections that go with it tbh I’d rather have darker skin with less imperfections than spending MY YOUTH to treat these little shits.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Emulsion: A hydrating emulsion infused with brightening extracts that make for a lovely day moisturizer if you have oily skin. It smells amazing and for some, it really helps with water – oil imbalance. What I have noticed about emulsions is that they give your skin an instant surge of moisture and sink into your skin instantly but your skin's moisture levels plummet down to zero in about an hour. And you need a thicker cream to lock it in and hold that down for a timed release through out the day. And for dry skinned people, a cream alone is not enough since the emulsion 6orms a slippery layer on the skin, making the cream apply better and you can use less while still having a nice layer of it on your face. You might think that's counter intuitive but emulsion are far cheaper and you get much more for the price you pay. And the cream itself is thicker and with higher oil content while the emulsion is higher in water so you'll get a nicer balance of both elements.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Eye Serum: A lightweight eye serum meant to correct dark circles and puffiness with the included Zamak applicator. My clients love this because it really helps with their dark circles and it's the perfect choice for those who gave up on eye creams altogether because it the milia it causes.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Cream: A beautifully textured cream that is thick yet melts down into a milky texture and sinking into your skin, anchoring down everything you've put on your skin before. It gives your skin instant hydration but also provides some lipids as well.  I might say it's not enough for a night cream but for a day cream it is amazing. I can definitely see some plumpness even when used alone (with products from other brands, come on I can't use this product ONLY and expect a miracle, skincare is supposed to be a system)\r\n+Snowise Brightening UV Protector: A color correcting hybrid sunscreen with two shades (#1 Soft Glow for darker skin tones, #2 Soft Peach for skin that is pale but not bright or radiant) This sunscreen's texture is soft and creamy, smells like a dream and applies like a dream. They have turned the weakness of any physical filter into a strength. This sunscreen gives a subtle tone up effect that does not alsst long but should last long enough until you reapply again (2 hours)\r\n\r\n-Bloomstay: Launched in April to replace Innerise,  the line consists of a water,  serum and cream to provide a healthy dose of essential nutrients and antioxidants for skin to transition from late 20s to early 30s. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Water: *Cardi B voice* OKURRRR ZAMN they got the scent right!!!!  Ugh to die for!  This water is made from 5 types of germinated fruits and seed extracts, hardy orange, plum blossom extracts and the Jaumdan complex. It hydrates my skin very well. Reminds me of the Huxley Essence: Grab Water but much more fragrant. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Serum: Super smooth and soft, it has the same extracts as the water albeit more condensed + Niacinamide for brightening and soothing benefits. My skin feels amazingly calm and translucent after using this. Ugh.  Ugggghhhhh. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Cream: A thick smooth cream that makes people with dry skin HOWL. I am gagged by how much I love it. Spreads like butter and moisturizes deeply through the night. I can't comment on it's effects on fine lines because I don't have any.  (I use Sulwhasoo for as long as I can remember so duh) \r\n\r\n-Everefine: Previously the Goa line (until Sulwhasoo decided black was too goth for their brand). Meant for women in menopause experience hormonal shifts. The Goa line used to consist of an ampoule, an eye cream, a facial cream and a neck cream. The new Everefine line only has 2 products which are the ampoule and the cream. The neck cream has moved to the basic line, a line of optional add on products which can be used along with every line. You are expected to use the eye cream of the Ginseng line to accompany Everefine products from now on. \r\n.+Everefine Lifting Ampoule Serum: Quite a confusing name there. Basically the power of a serum on steroids (ampoules) with the absorption speed of a regular gel serum. It does not sound too much of a gel to me with Murumuru butter being the 4th ingredient. That and a lot of silicones and jojoba esters (yes in love with that shit), so I feel like this will be a very thick and richly moisturizing serum. It also contains coumestrol (a proven an Maseondan complex which is made of replenishing ingredients such as Gingko Biloba, Soy leaf extract, Shiitake mushroom extract, Adenosine (Proven anti aging ingredient) and of course, their signature Jaumdan mixture decocted in Honey. There is Jaumdan at the heart of every Sulwhasoo product. Maybe that’s why these products and the FCAS work together so well since they work in synergy. \r\n\r\n+Everefine Lifting Cream: This is a cream that is EVEN MORE emollient than the serum (ok I am a whore for emollient things so hmu please), it has the same Maseondan and Jaumdan complexes but now with cocoa extract + two super nourishing oils, Squalane and Meadowfoam seed oil. I'm seriously gonna try this because why the heck not.\r\n\r\n-Men: Range for men. Smells like pine. Manly.\r\n\r\n+Refreshing Cleansing Foam: A thick cleansing foam that can be used two ways. One you lather it up into a poof and wash your face. Two rub directly on a wet face as a scrub. Nothing impressive about the ingredients, it contains ginseng powder as the last ingredient and walnut shell powder as an exfoliant. I use this in the shower or on trips. It does remove makeup nicely when my oil cleanser isn’t around.\r\n\r\n+Inner Charging Serum: Ok you can't put a toner in a fancy bottle and call it a serum. That's cheating! Used this, smells nice and is basically Essential Balancing Water EX with a nice manly scent. It's not way too manly like cheap aftershave. It's very subtle and sophisticated. Speaking of aftershaves, this could be used as one.\r\n\r\n+Skin Reinforcing Emulsion: My favorite product of the range. Quick, no frills moisture on the go, a must have in my bag. Really good makeup primer. HG.\r\n\r\n+Age Defying Cream: Good for men who don't know what they want and want a bit of everything. This is for age prevention.\r\n\r\n+Relaxing UV Protector: A sunscreen FOR MEN and IN BLACK. Smells MANLY like MAN STUFF. Nice sunscreen, no frills, physical so u can apply and go and not wait 30 mins because MEN DON'T WAIT, WE ARE IMPATIENT.\r\n\r\n-Timetreasure: Their priciest complete anti aging line, might I even say, age reversal. Previously called Extra Refining, the line revolves around the power of the Red Pine, a type of pine so rare it is one of the most endangered species. AmorePacific cultivates it their own since harvesting wild red pine would be illegal. It would cost you $80 for just a bottle of red pine oil, but wait, don't Timetreasure products cost way more than that? You're right, but that’s because Timetreasure uses red pine extract, not oil, therefore it contains more of the actual essence of the tree bark. And you're paying for the fact that they know how to mix certain ingredients together so that it would work even better. Also did I mention red pine bark extract is the 1st ingredient in every Timetreasure product? (Not including the cleansing foam) I can not stress enough as a person with super dry skin even instagram  humid weather that this line is my HG (especially when used with Harmonizen) and with concerns for aging skin (people say I'm better off with Innerise but no hoe I know what I'm doing). Also to clear any misunderstanding, Timetreasure is more expensive than Ginseng (with both being anti aging lines) because Timetreasure also works on brightness more and prevents sagging, age spots, and smoothes out wrinkles in the long run (unlike some cheap collagen cream that seem to work instantly), something Ginseng couldn't do. I tested this on my self + my mom + my grandma and yes we all love it. \r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Extra Creamy Cleansing Foam: A newly launched product, and let me set the record straight, this is my mother of all HG cleansing foams. A thick cream that lathers up into clouds of extra creamy foam that cleanses even foundation effectively with no oil cleanser (just not eye makeup), it smells dreamy (different from the other products in the range, which are still dreamy btw) and my skin feels more MOISTURIZED than before using it, sometimes I leave the foam on my face as a mask. Since most cleansers only go as far as not stripping my skin, but this one actually ADDED MOISTURE to my skin while removing all of the nasties. One pea sized drop makes enough foam for 4, sleepover tested. This thing feels like I am washing my face with a moisturizer. If you want a taste of the Timetreasure line without paying the price, try this.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Water EX: This toner is probably the best toner from Sulwhasoo, it's a liquid toner with a slightly tacky finish that gives your skin an amazing glow and intense moisture and when used with the emulsion provides an amazing complexion not even a Siberian winter could ruin.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Emulsion EX: The unskippable product responsible for most of the moisture of this line. I use two pumps every day and night and the deep, warm scent of red pine just embraces my skin and lulls me to sleep, something I do not appreciate in the morning lol. This emulsion is super fast-spreading and is the same texture as the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX. When used with the water my skin is super soft, glowy and smooth and ready for the next treatment step. Tbh if I ever go home at 3AM and feel not even human, I just double cleanse, use the water and this. And I wake up to dewy skin, albeit at 11AM.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Serum EX: Containing the highest amount of red pine extract in the entire Timetreasure range, this serum is thick and creamy and smells lovely, one pump is enough for your face and neck. I am too young to see any wrinkle improvement but I can say that it gives my skin that extra 5 hours of sleep and I don't wake up with pillow marks on my face any more. It's amazing and it's such a rescue for dry skin. My mom actually saw some brightening and wrinkle reduction, her smile lines have softened, her forehead lines are gone (mine can never be because I tend to move my forehead a lot, she doesn't), and she has glowy skin even though she sleeps 4 hours a day. After a month, I'd say she looks at least 5 years younger. As for my grandma, her skin improved as well. She has super dry skin and the Timetreasure range is exactly what she needed. Her skin became firmer, her sagging was minimized and the skin looked brighter.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Eye Serum: This was launched along with the Timetreasure cleansing foam, a new eye product for better anti aging effect around the eye contour, the serum is meant for dark circles and loss of elasticity, it also provides some lifting as well and gives a “wide awake” effect, while the eye cream is meant for moisture, wrinkle correction and to increase the effectiveness of the eye serum. This comes with a golden eye care massager and with an instruction video to use both the eye serum and cream. The serum is thinner in texture compared to the Timetreasure facial serum. It sinks in quickly and when used with the accompanying massager and following all the steps, my eyes do look lifted and awake. My mom refused to use this as she thinks it's too much work though, my grandma enjoyed it though.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Eye Cream: I have noticed that this eye cream might come off as thick, but it's actually some sort of patented manufacturing process that makes this cream fluffy, not thick. Thick is like O Hui The First's eye cream, this one is actually just really fluffy, that’s why it melts down into an oil around your eyes which feels reallllly good. This when used alone provides firmness to my eyes. But when used with the serum, it's a life changing experience. My eyes have never looked this good. I could hold a baby next to my face and actually see no difference between our eyes. I truly love this product and the eye serums. My HG.\r\n\r\n+Sulwhasoo Timetreasure Renovating Cream: This cream has the most intense red pine scent of all the Timetreasure products. This is a thick rich cream that has a slightly brownish-red tint and actually DOES NOT go on smooth. It is tacky as hell. Do not even dream of using this without an emulsion. But when you use it, oh boy, it just locks everything in and gives such long lasting moisture without clogging pores (But common sense is required, this range is not for oily people!) It works even better with the serum, it made my skin so plump and radiant. And everytime my S.O kisses my cheek he always say that I smell like herbs, which is a good thing (I hope lol). The entire range as whole has changed my skin, I can't say the same for any skincare range (the two exceptions are Whoo's Hwanyu and Guerlain's Orchidee Guerlain, they are exceptional in their own way, and probably the skin I have today is the result of rotating between really expensive skincare and not sticking to just one brand.)\r\n\r\n-Harmonizen: If you think Timetreasure is pretty intense, this is not the end of it. Harmonizen is the mother of all Sulwhasoo intense-ness. And when I say my skin has an obnoxiously expensive taste for skincare, boy do I mean it. This line has one product and one product only, the holy Harmonizen Regenerating Cream EX. The cream is loaded with beneficial ingredients that I challenge you to read without gasping for air, and is meant to be used with the Timetreasure line in place of the Timetreasure Renovating Cream EX for ultimate anti aging. Some use it as a night cream due to the price (650,000 won, broooo, bro. Bro.) and texture. Also if it makes you feel any better paying an extortionate price for a 60ml jar of facial cream, some also use it in place of eye cream and serum \r\n\r\n+Harmonizen Regenerating Cream EX: Sulwhasoo's most expensive item out of all of their offerings. Formulated with Dermosul™ technology, and loaded with powerful extracts such as salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) which is actually clinically proven to have an anti wrinkle effect, ginseng extract, red and white ginseng saponin, murumuru and shea butter, angelica actiloba, mugwort, cnidium officinale, two types of licorice extract (glycyrrhiza uralensis and glycyrrhiza glabra for brightening), broussonetia kazinoki and oldenlandia diffusa for extra brightening (please see http://www.google.com/patents/US8647683 for a patent of a whitening ingredient composed of these ingredients), powerful humectants such as Sodium PCA, natural moisturizing factors (NMFs): ( Squalane , Beta Glucan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Cholesterol),  green tea leaf extract, meadowfoam oil, quinoa seed extract, vitamin E (tocopherol, tocopheryl linoleate), red pine extract (hello there Timetreasure), allantoin (for soothing benefits), fatty acids (arachidic acid, behenic acid), amino acids  (serine, alanine, glutamic acid), vitamin CG (ascorbyl glucoside), arginine, and finally the legendary Jaumdan decocted in honey. Wow. That was a mouthful. Anyways, the cream smells like herbs and stuff, very Sulwhasoo-y, but it is very faint and will disappear the moment you put it on your skin. But according to the website, the scent is composed of “Mugwort, pine, clove, Frankincense, white sandal wood, Agastache rugosa” or whatever the hell that is. It is SUPER SUPER SUPER thick, about the thickest cream I have ever witnessed in my life and goes on super smooth, it melts into your skin and then you'll have this sort of waxy finish for the first 5 minutes then it shifts into a smooth, silky finish. You are meant to use the accompanying obsidian spatula as an applicator / massage tool.  After two jars, I can conclude that this is indeed my HG cream out of all creams. My mom and grandma loved it as well. My skin was glowing and radiant, I think it actually made my skin one tone whiter, not brighter and my biggest dark spots shrank into tiny ones that you can't see without closing up on my face like a maniac, and it kind of makes my skin feel like when I was using the Whoo Hwanyu Ampoule (which is way more expensive than this tho) so maybe I can save some moolah after all :> My mom said her skin was so much brighter and her wrinkles have faded (not all of course). And she loves the fact that she can skip serum and eye cream with this product because she is a lazy bean :v My grandma said she thinks that it makes her face more vibrant and more rosy, which none of the products she tried done for her. I think this is definitely worth the money )) if it’s good, it’s worth it, it's not expensive, just high priced :v If you pay a shit ton for something with poor ingredients and does not work, then you can call it expensive.\r\n\r\n-Essentrue: Signature body care line from Sulwhasoo. It has a anti aging and moisturizing effect with honey and schizophyllum commune, pine nut oil, lotus fruit oil, prunus mume oil, apricot kernel oil and camellia oil\r\n\r\n+Essentrue Silky Body Serum: This lives true to it's name, it goes on so fresh and silky smooth and leves my body glowing as if I used a body oil, but this is not half as heavy. \r\n\r\n+Essentrue Deep Nourishing Body Cream EX: A lovely product to layer on top of the body serum in colder months. This feels so nice and luxurious and I can feel it wrapping my body in pure goodness. My mom said it also helps with her flabby arms.\r\n\r\n+Essentrue Hand Cream: It exists but almost nobody knows about it. And I can't get my hands on it no matter where I inquire. Must be discontinued.\r\n\r\n-Basic and Special: A line of miscellaneous products to accompany your regimen\r\n\r\n+Gentle Cleansing Oil EX: God damn do I love this oil, it deletes 9 layers of makeup in one go and moisturizes to no end. I recommend this to people who have blackheads as well and they find that it makes extractions easier and it helps minimize pores. I sometimes do musical plays so I tend to wear a lot of makeup, face painting and what not. And this removes everything :o I love it! And it smells amazing!\r\n\r\n+Gentle Cleansing Foam EX: A gentle cleansing foam that does not strip skin while effectively cleansing. I use this in the shower, mostly to get rid of the excess conditioner lying around on my skin. It smells good. pH 6.5-7\r\n\n+Gentle Cleansing Water: Gentle,  smells good. I wouldn't pay this much though?\n\r\n+Herbal Soap: My HG during breakouts. This smells strongly of ginseng (me likey) and foams like a dream. My breakouts cleared overnight. Bigger breakouts? 3 days. Remember to moisturize though as this is really drying, like really, but is it worth it? Hell yes. \r\n\r\n+Benecircle Massage Cream EX: This upgraded twice a week massage cream has a cream to oil formula plus the scent of plum blossom instead of the old signature Sulwhasoo base scent. I like the older one tho as it gives more control, while this is too slippery and makes massaging a bit harder. I also prefer the old scent. But I have to admit it moisturizes better than the old massage cream. Both give me a rosy glow due to increased circulation. I actually use this everyday. The oil emulsifies beautifully so if the pump bottle of the oil is too hard for travelling for you then try this since it's in a convenient tube and it removes makeup nicely, not as well as the oil but it wasn't designed for that anyway. If you have dry skin then use after FCAS and wipe excess off with tissue. If you have any other skin type other than dry, rinse after using and then apply FCAS.\r\n\r\n+Clarifying Mask EX: A twice a week peel off mask used after the emulsion step to help it absorb better and brightening + exfoliating. This smells so good and texture is honey like yess. My skin is so smooth and soft after using this. The only peel off mask I like. But the only con is that it takes 9 lives to dry a.k.a 30 minutes. \r\n\r\n+Overnight Vitalizing Mask EX: A thick, rich creamy sleeping mask that compliments your Sulwhasoo moisturizer perfectly without suffocating skin, it can be used as a night cream for oiler skin types. I love the smell and it feels like my skin is reborn every time I use it. \r\n\r\n+Radiance Energy Mask: Containing real white jade, this sleeping mask purifies skin for a brighter tone. AND BOY, SHE THICK. SHE THICK. Wow. Like this is so nice for dry skin and I feel like I am so blessed with this baby :o\r\n\r\n+Herblinic Intensive Infusion Ampoules: This baby is so good at calming down breakouts. A surefire anti acne combo is Herblinic + Herbal Soap + FCAS.. Use this after water and before emulsion. An anti aging ampoule that helps with acne? WOW. I AM SHOCKED. The miraculous anti acne effect isn't even advertised so I guess it's a beneficial side effect lol. My skin is way softer and smoother btw.\r\n\r\n+Microdeep Intensive Filling Cream and Patch: My mom uses this and I could visibly see her smile lines soften and it lasts! Just do your regular skincare after you do this treatment and the lines shouldn't come back. Sure it's not Botox but I mean it's something lol\r\n\r\n+Luminature Essential Finisher EX: This is created with Locsamhyo, a complex of ginseng and green tea for superior anti oxidative properties and is meant to be a long term preventive measure to prevent free radicals in an urban environment. This goes on as the last step of skincare (before sunscreen in the AM and before sleeping mask in the PM) to lock in the effects of your skincare and give your skin an antioxidant boost. I feel like my skin is fresher and brighter vs. just using skincare alone, and it helps my cushion / BB cream stay brighter for longer. Over years of using this product, I’d say that the benefit it give me (smaller pores, smoother skin, rosy glow) are far beyond what I paid for.\r\n\r\n+Firming Neck Cream: Originally from the Goa line, this neck cream promises to firm up neck skin and increase elasticity. My mom is using this but she is not getting much results  what a bummer. It smells nice though.\r\n\r\n+Renodigm Dual Care Cream EX: Pronounced “ren-no- dime”, it's a sunscreen / day cream if you're lazy. It not only contains SPF but also TPF to protect your skin from UV rays and heat, the causes for hyperpigmentation. It smells lovely and it's my HG sunscreen because it is so nice and so rich in moisture. It is a ridiculous price to pay for sunscreen though. Fun fact I used to call this “ren-no-dig-um”. Also did yall know AmorePacific own the patent to the TPF measurement? Shook.\r\n\r\n+Trufresh Soothing Mask: Meant to be used with Renodigm Dual Care Cream EX at night as part of thei heat protection solutions. You can use this as a rinse off mask (before FCAS) or a sleeping mask / night cream if u got oily skin. I smell Laneige Water Sleeping Mask vibes.\r\n\r\n+Essential Balm: Multi purpose moisturizing balm for eyes, lips and cuticles. Smells nice and keeps my lips soft. Some people put it on insect bites and split ends apparently. \r\n\r\n+Camellia hair oil: Smells lovely and tames frizz. Would not pay this much for a hair product if it ain't Goldwell though.\r\n\r\n-Hollistic Care: A series of products that embodies the Sulwhasoo spirit of tranquility. \r\n\r\n+First Peace: This home fragrance collection is inspired from the First Peace Essential Oil used in Sulwhasoo SPA. It has a candle, a potpourri, a fragrance sachet in the lineup and can only be bought in the Flagship store of Sulwhasoo. Therefore I will not mention this in the Flagship store section again. The candle can be bought outside the Flagship Store with another design though. \r\n\r\n+Plum Blossom: Just like the First Peace collection, but it also features a perfume oil for use on the body. None of the products from this collection can be bought outside of the Flagship Store. There is also a hand cream duo set that has the Plum Blossom and First Peace hand cream attached so you can't buy them separately. They make my hand so soft but I like First Peace more tbh.\r\n\r\n+Invigorating Ginseng  Extract Ampoule: A 4-week supply of supplement ampoules with ginseng extract. I haven't tried this as I feel like they might benefit old people more. I'm going to get my dad a box of this for Lunar New Year.\r\n\r\n+Lantern Collection: A golden-glazed version of their bestsellers: Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX, Essential Balancing Water EX, Essential Balancing Emulsion EX, First Care Activating Serum, Perfecting Cushion Intense. Perfect for any die hard Sulwhasoo fan and collectors as well. Having this full lantern collection is just about as much of a feat as owning every Shineclassic compact from every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lunar Zodiac Sign Collection: First Care Activating Serum EX in 12 designs featuring the lunar zodiac sign of your choice. All 12 zodiac signs can be bought at the Flagship Store at any time of day and any year , however the representative zodiac sign for the current year will be sold everywhere worldwide, not limited to the flagship store. (For example Sulwhasoo's FCAS has a dog on it this year and sold worldwide, but the other 11 zodiac signs are only sold in the Flagship Store)\r\n\r\n+Herbal Tea: Teaming up with Osulloc (Korea's #1 premium tea brand also from AmorePacific), Sulwhasoo releases 4 kinds of herbal teas to complete the holistic beauty experience. The range has Red Ginseng Blended Tea, Samdayeon Jeju Tangerine Tea (my fave), Sejak Green Tea, Plum Blossom Herb Tea. These tea actually taste really good and I asked my friend to get me like 5 boxes of Samdayeon Jeju Tangerine Tea lol I am addicted. Good for sipping when drama and conflicts happen. Sip sip bitch.\r\n\r\n+Herbal Soap: They also launched a new Herbal Soap collection with 4 facial soaps: Pine (for stressed, acne prone skin), oldenlandia diffusa (for brightening), licorice (for abundant moisture), red ginseng (original formula for skin lacking vitality and polluted with toxic substances)\r\n\r\n+Balm Series: Contains the Essential Balm with redesigned packaging and two other balms. Deep Relax Balm (Haven't tried this yet, supposed to be the Essential Balm but with a more relaxing scent), and Lip Tint Balm (lovely color that adds a rosy touch while not being too obvious about it)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is it for my post, 40k char max",

    "body": "\r\nSo guys, as promised, this is their lineup of makeup products. Sorry I couldn't get it in the main post of all of their other products because they allow 40k characters max which is pretty generous but I exceeded that (wow lol talkative me) So their makeup has many lines and it's easy to be confused, just like how you would with their skincare. Let's get to it!\n\n \n\n**1. Cushion:** 3 cushion products and supporting products.\n\n-\n\n \n\n* **Perfecting Cushion EX**: The OG cushion from Sulwhasoo that took the beauty blogger world by store got an upgrade in August 2017. The added Schizophyllum Commune extract increase the moisture content to the OG formula with Jaumdan and apricot kernel oil. A few tweaks were made to enhance the durability and wear of this cushion. I love this, it works better than ever. Comes in more shades too: #11, #15, #17, #21, #23, #25, #27, #31, #33 and up to #37. Good bye to this stupid stereotype that Korean cushions ain't diverse.\n\n \n\n* **Perfecting Cushion Brightening**: This cushion is more like a CC cushion, meaning it doesn't cover flaws but rather correcting a dull and sallow skin tone. It has Jaumdan and Snowise Complex (white ginseng extract + licorice for brightening) . It contains magnolia extract and arbutin (> 2%) for brighrening. It also has an oil absorbing network and mother of pearl powder for increased luminance. It comes in #11, #13, #17, #21, #23, #25, and #33. It's not enough coverage for me but some others swear by this.\n\n \n\n* **Perfecting Cushion Intense:** The highest coverage cushion with the highest moisture level as well. Enriched with Jaumdan, Pearlescent powder, plum blossom extract and Red Pine extract for stronger, more resilient skin. This is basically like a serum-in-cushion since it’s so hydrating. It comes in a wide range of colors and I love the way the case looks. It comes in a wide array of colors #11, #13, #17, #21, #23, #25 and #33. This is my HG cushion for my dry ass skin along with O Hui's The First Ampoule Cover Cushion. Also available in Lantern Collection version.\n\n \n\n___________\n\n \n\n**Makeup Balancer**:\n\n-\n\nA makeup base specifically made to be used with Sulwhasoo cushions. It offers light color correction using the 3 fundamental colors of your skin and providing rich moisture.\n\n \n\n* #1 (Light Pink) is made for dull skin\n\n* #2 (Light Green) is made for acne prone, inflamed, irritated skin with redness,\n\n* #3 (Light Purple) is for yellow skin tone that needs a whitening boost. The purple pigment neutralizes the yellow shades to reveal bright translucent skin.\n\n \n\nAll shades just give a slightly brighter finish, and there's a lot of moisture to this so yess I am enjoying this!!!\n\n____\n\n \n\n**Powder For Cushion:**\n\n-\n\nA powder specifically designed for cushion to absorb oil and help anchor the foundation to the skin. I mean this is fine and you could definitely use something cheaper though.\n\n \n\n____\n\n**Multi Cushion Highlighter:**\n\n-\n\n A customizable highlighter to use before or after cushion, or even after the finishing powder for various degrees of radiance.\n\n \n\n----\n\n \n\n**Evenfair:** Makeup for people who want lightweight, no BS makeup.\n\n-\n\n \n\n- **Evenfair Smoothing Foundation:** A moisture rich, silky foundation that gently wraps the skin while providing sufficient coverage.\n\n \n\n- **Evenfair Smoothing Powder Foundation:** Can be used on top of the liquid foundation or on it's own with a primer it covers flaws and provides a natural, bright finish. The particles melt into your skin so this isn't even visible on the skin, unlike many other powder foundations.\n\n \n\n___\n\n**Lumitouch:** An elevated line of makeup leaning toward the coverage end of the spectrum.\n\n-\n\n+ **Lumitouch Liquid Foundation:** A quick setting foundation that has a semi matte finish.\n\n+ **Lumitouch Cream Foundation:** A richer, creamier foundation for dry skin types and a dewier finish. Me likey.\n\n+ **Lumitouch Skin Cover:** A creamy foundation-concealer balm. When used right it give an even and bright complexion. When not used right, you’re gonna be a cakey mess.\n\n+ **Lumitouch Twincake:** Use it on top of the liquid or cream foundation for extra high coverage or use on it's own with a wet or dry puff for normal coverage. The name “Twincake” is derived from “two way pact” meaning you can use it both ways, wet or dry You could keep this around for retouching.\n\n+ **Lumitouch Powder:** Adds a luminous finish to your makeup and locks it in. No smudge, no budge, no bullshit. HG finish powder.\n\n \n\n___\n\n \n\n**Snowise:** Accompanying line for Snowise skincare.\n\n-\n\nWait, but what about the Brightening Cushion? I know you'd ask that. You are basically left with two directions. One, do your makeup the lazy way aka cushion. Two, use this line, take a bit longer but have perfect skin because there are some things a cushion just couldn't cover up. You can retouch using the Brightening Cushion, same goes for the Timetreasure line\n\n \n\n+ **Snowise Whitening BB Essence:** A lightweight BB serum the brightens skin and has a light, buildable coverage. This shares 47% of the ingredients as the Snowise serum. (This doesn't mean 47% of this product is serum)\n\n+ **Snowise Whitening UV Pact:** A finishing pact for glowing and hydrated skin. This is my favorite pressed powder :o\n\n \n\n___\n\n \n\n \n\n**Timetreasure:** The accompanying makeup line for Timetreasure skincare.\n\n-\n\nThis range offers more hydration, and more coverage vs the Intense Cushion so it's for people with drier skin and more flaws/wrinkles.\n\n \n\n+ Timetreasure Radiance Makeup Base: A base containing color correcting trifecta of jade, coral and gold to correct dull and sallow skin tone. It contains red pine + Jaumdan for extra hydration.\n\n \n\n+ Timetreasure Radiance Foundation: A foundation with Timetreasure oil complex that gives skin a natural glow. It also works to cover and actively correct wrinkles around the clock.\n\n \n\n+ Timetreasure Radiance Powder Foundation: For those who prefer a lighter way to do makeup, use this powder for quick brightening. Or use this on top of the liquid foundation to give your skin a perfect smooth texture all day long. You don't use this for retouching, you use the Intense Cushion for that.\n\n \n\n___\n\n \n\n**Others:** Miscellaneous products you can use to add on\n\n-\n\n \n\n+ Complete Care CC Emulsion: This is basically the liquid foundation inside your cushion, but without the actual cushion sponge. I love this product be it contains 53.2% moisturizing ingredients and gives my dry skin a very nice dewy glow in one lazy step.\n\n\n\n\n+ Eyebrow Perfector: Eyebrow grooming brush + immaculately smooth pencil formula. This is the first makeup product from Sulwhasoo made without Jaumdan or any beneficial ingredient at all. Yeah it's just brows but I did hope something to set it apart from other brands. It IS Sulwhasoo though. The application is smooth and nice and the pencil was subtly pigmented. I think it's a lot easier than stabbing and dragging your pencil through your eyebrows like 3838292492919589329 times (coughlorealcough) \n \n\n \n\n+ Essential Concealer Stick: A buildable concealer, it minimizes it's use of traditional waxes to maximize fluidity and glide. It covers lightly and does not get your face cakey. It’s the only concealer I’ve used, maybe the one from Dior that I used like once but that was a year ago so I could conclude that this is HG status or pretty standard for a concealer. I feel like it is pretty good at what it does. #1 (Medium Pink) is effective at concealing dark spots and dull zones, #2 (Medium Beige) is good at concealing blemishes and redness. (Update: No longer HG hehe, the crown is snatched by my YSL Touche Eclat) \n\n \n\n+ Radiance Blusher: A tri-colored blush for naturally rosy cheeks, use the lightest color for highlighting, the medium color for a basic blush/eyeshadow, the darkest color for eyeshadow or blend them all together to create a perfectly blended blush color that is only a bit pink and not overdone. #1 (Pink Harmony) is meant for fairer skin tones, adding a rosy glow. #2 (Coral Harmony) is meant for darker skin tones, creating liveliness.\n\n\n___\n\n\n**Sheer Lasting:** Their newly released makeup collection designed to work with Bloomstay skincare. It highly focuses on antioxidants such as Sea Buckthorn, Orange Day-lily and Vitamin E. It's their first ever makeup line without having their signature Jaumdan mixture. I haven't tried it but I don't seem to like it already because it lacks the \"Sulwhasoo\" factor which is their Jaumdan mixture, the hanbang ingredients (sea buckthorn is not a hanbang ingredient) and both of the formulas contain polyethylene, which I do not stand for in skincare as it is environmentally damaging. On the bright side I have heard the formulas are very long lasting and sheer as the name suggests. If you want to pursue a dewy, glass-skin look, this is for you.\n\n\n\n+Sheer Lasting Gel Cushion: The main product of this line. It utilizes a mesh network dispension mechanism instead of your typical 4th generation cushion sponge developed by AmorePacific. I might say this marks a new era for Sulwhasoo and all AmorePacific makeup.  Because of this mechanism, it dispenses evenly onto the cushion puff. This product is not really original in terms of mechanism, but I think Missha already did this first with their Tension makeup line. The cushion, unlike the ones of the Perfecting Cushion line, is only 12g and has no refill.\n\n\n\n+Sheer Lasting Foundation: The foundation features moisturizer-coated pigments infused with Sea Buckthorn and Orange Day-lily. The formula is the same as the gel cushion. Nothing much to say about this. \n\n \n\n___\n\n \n\n**Lip:** Their collection of lip products aren't as diverse as Whoo's but they aren't here to PLAY they're here to STAY.\n\n-\n\nIntensely hydrating, intensely pigmented, intensely plumping, might I say these lip products set the golden standard for all lip products.\n\n\n\n+ Essential Lip Serum Stick: A oil serum condensed in a stick. You heard me. It's left as it is (#1), or it is blended with a tinge of pink (#2) for a nice rosy touch, or if you don't wanna go the subtle way you can just have it mixed with bold, high performance, oil coated pigments (#3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8)  it has an oil blend of safflower and camellia , forming a double layer  of moisture. It also has apricot kernels seed oil and elastic complex to fill in wrinkles.\n\n \n\n+ Essential Lip Care: For extra care prior to the lip serum sticks. These are lip gels that are less occlusive and have more moisturizing/anti wrinkle functionality vs the lip serum sticks. They contain Day Lily, Sea Berry, Shea Butter, Peach Kernel Extract, Tigerlily Extract, Jaumdan in Honey and Ginseng saponins to moisturize and reduce wrinkles. It is a anti wrinkle functional cosmetic. #1 is used at night and #2 in the morning before lip makeup.\n\n \n\n___\n\n \n\n**Shineclassic:** Their line of limited edition presssed compact powders.\n\n-\n\nAvailable once a year and the case design changes annually and is hand crafted by master artisans.\n\n \n\n+ **Shineclassic Powder Compact:** A finishing pressed powder inspired by stone grinding techniques. It is a superfine powder texture mixed with a special pigment coated with prunus mume extract and Jaumdan decocted in honey. It is then further enhanced by adding white jade for skin purification and circulation enhancement and coral powder for a dazzling glow.\n\n \n\n+ **Shineclassic Multi Color Compact:** Created using the very same ingredients and principals as the Shineclassic Powder Compact with a bright touch of color. It is comparable to the Radiance Blusher but I feel that it is smoother and more pigmented than the Radiance Blusher. The Radiance Blusher has no refill while Shineclassic has both a main case refill, so the price per blush refill is not much of a difference.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

    "body": "So thanks to the lockdown and running out of my regular products, had to discover Indian brands/shops which led me down a mega rabbit hole resulting in *some* hoarding. Am usually a minimalist so it's been a struggle between quantity vs discovering some reasonably priced and effective brands/products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msbsfuhaywm51.jpg?width=1936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abe32113ad5c0981c4a8747ec5a1d752f71a6e0e\n\nAnyway, since the Kama hacking has helped a lot of you here's the summary of all my purchases to conclude the hoarding: \n\n* **Rose Water + Ayurvedic oils/face powders:** already covered at [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/io40dj/hacking\\_kama\\_product\\_reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/io40dj/hacking_kama_product_reviews/)\n* **Moksha Oils:** Got 8 oils - great prices, quick delivery. Have made AM/PM oils blends for my mum and me with all the oils. So far so good, as have created blends hard to figure out individual efficacy. They'll last a loooong time so will decide to RP when that happens.\n* **MRT Organics:** Got 4 oils and Red Sandalwood powder. Most products were out of stock on their site and emailed them, Whatsapp'ed them, then called them up and had them update the stock. So comms was basic but glad I got the products, prices are good and the quality seems legit. Mixed the products in the face oil so can't track individual efficacy, but can say with certainty that the red sandalwood (**HG**) has given an additional glow boost to the AVP/AVS face powder mix. Will also last a long time.\n* **SOS Organics:** Apricot kernel oil is now my **body oil HG,** super light, absorbs fast and feels nourishing, smells like almond oil. Tea infusions are ok, been having plain or mixed with green tea but will get from Mittal's next time. For Apricot Oil you can also buy from other Uttarakhand NGO's - Aarohi, Kilmora. Mom want to diy a body scrub so picked up an Apricot scrub from Aarohi from a local shop - yes we've all had St Ive's disasters but this is super finely ground and becomes more like a paste.\n* **Mittal Teas:** The quality of everything I've got from them is on/above par with the tea my family and I have had in some super fancy places across the world. Going to buy teas and the brass infuser as gifts, super practical vs the ball infuser, and pretty. They supply teas to the Taj hotel group. **HG shop.**\n* **Tvakh:** Was looking out for a Vit C serum and since there aren't any good Indian products decided to try this for my hormonal acne as suggested by u/SouthernResolution and got a sample size from Smytten. I actually like it and  **WRP** as it goes into my routine well.\n* **Neemli:** Did like them, they did work and had a good texture. I got the minis to try, the pumps stopped working which they addressed asap. **WRP** if I can't get Asian products. Btw their products are manufactured by Tvakh.\n* **Ashba:** Don't follow CGM but do use CG products, like the leave-in conditioner so far, need to try it out for longer. **Still testing.**\n* **Baene:** After u/kparwal's lip post, looked for a lip scrub, was for Rs. 205 only with a free soap and shipping. It's actually my first lip scrub and think it's alright. **Still testing.**\n* **Skog:** Got their lip oil, no manufacturing/licensing info mentioned anywhere. While it's hydrating, the effect lasts only 15 mins and now with my collection of oils will make my own mix when this is over. **WNRP.**\n* **Amrutam:** The Kuntal Hair Spa worked well for the first bottle, then had to mix with AVP Nilibrighandi oil as it got too dry and the effect plateaued. Bhringraj Shampoo/Conditioner - stay away - it's super grass-like hair drying even after reducing the quantity used. Body Wash, Sharbat and their service is meh. **WNRP.**\n* **Suganda:** Found the effect of White Lotus and Rosehip serums very short-lived and not hydrating enough even after adding Squalane. **WNRP.**\n* **Dr Sheths:**  Got the Multitasking cream, it's an overpriced runny lotion + they don't share full ingredients anywhere. **WNRP.**\n* **Plum:** Got the stem cell renewal cream - feels like calamine lotion, blah. **WNRP.**\n\nI've lived across the world, have tried the fancy Western brands, the obscure Asian brands, and now the Indian Ayurvedic products. My summary from all the hoarding and testing is:\n\n* **Ayurvedic products:** works for hair oil/hair mask (think it's better suited to our hair type) and face masks.\n* **For the main routine:** prefer Asian brands > Western brands > Indian brands\n* **On Face oils:** did an analysis of \\~40 fancy oils/serums/elixirs (analysis is unstructured to share unlike the Kama one but highlights are):\n\n1. most are a mix of 5+ oils.\n2. with your own mix, the price/ml clearly works out waaaay cheaper and can use the oils for hair/lips/body also.\n3. Found these 2 links helpful to research the best oils for your concerns: [http://www.baast.ca/oils-chart/](http://www.baast.ca/oils-chart/) [https://www.holistichealthherbalist.com/complete-list-of-comedogenic-oils/](https://www.holistichealthherbalist.com/complete-list-of-comedogenic-oils/)\n\nAnd that's it everyone, have enough products to last me for a while. There've been a few misses but several HG's so all's well that ends well :). Also, have absolutely loved discovering these wholesale turned retail family businesses, NGOs, and old ayurvedic companies. It was kinda like an online version of going to those handicraft expos or busy bazaar lanes!\n\nThank you for all the love on the other posts, hope you enjoy all these discoveries as well :)",

    "body": "Sharing my post here as well. Recently, I had posted requesting dupes for Bite's Agave Lip Mask as it is now being discontinued. This stuff is ride or die lip salvation for me. I live somewhere super dry, work in a dry environment, take meds that dry me out, you get the picture. I'm a moisture junkie. I gathered the piece that works is the lanolin in it so I tried some similar products and wrote some reviews of them.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It also got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. It's good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. It's a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. It's a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, it's going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!",

I usually have to warm a little of the product on my finger before applying it because it is so thick. It has a very slightly minty scent and a slight cooling sensation on application. It comes in a small tin, and one tin lasts me approximately a year of twice daily use. I also work in a hospital environment, and this is the only balm that has ever adequately protected my lips from the dry hospital air. It’s also currently $10 (half off) on their website. Thanks to you, I looked it up so I could post the ingredients and saw the sale so I’ll probably stock up on a little more!\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Cera Alba (Beeswax, Cire d'abeille), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Water/Aqua/Eau, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Aroma (Flavor), Urea, Mel (Honey, Miel), Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hydroxide, EDTA, Eugenol.",

I've never tried the Bite Beauty Lip Mask so I can't say how it compares, but I love the Lanolips 101 Ointment. However, I can't use it on its own because it's not very hydrating, it just sits on top and keeps whatever moisture I have in, but if I don't have any moisture it won't do anything. I usually use whatever face lotion I'm using at night on my lips and then put my lanolips on. If my lips are really dry (I just got a crack today so will do tonight) I'll use some First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair cream on my lips then the Lanolips. This helps SO MUCH!

    "body": "Okay so, recently I asked for help to build up an oil guide, so I decided to post what I've got together so far! If more info is given then I'll edit this to add it in. Thank you to the masses of people who gave info the help me expand this list, and hopefully this can help out some other folk too!\n\n*****\n\n**This is a guide to give personal input and experiences from valued members of the /r/skincareaddiction thread on reddit. This gives an insight into the different effects, usages and other desired info that might be desired from first hand users.**\n\n*****\n\nTo gain insight into the technical aspects of any oil please refer to [this](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html) guide. If you don’t want to scroll simply use ctrl+f to search the page for the desired oil to read up on the base information for it.\n\nAll oils have a limited shelf life. Please use the above guide to check the shelf life of most oils if you purchase any. Don’t use oil you think may be out of date on any part of you. You can extend the life of an oil by keeping it in the fridge, or if you have loads and won’t be using a chunk of it for a while it can be frozen. Please store your oils in the best way you have available to you.\n\n*****\n\n###If any information within this is incorrect, you have anything to add to it, or any other anecdotes then please do tell me. This was built from peoples comments and experiences so I'm happy to alter it to give a more well rounded view or accurate information where needed###\n\n*****\n\n\n**Apricot Kernel Oil**\n\n* One of the thinner oils\n* Doesn’t have a particular scent\n* Doesn’t often cause bad reactions but as always, this isn’t the case for everyone\n* Very nourishing for the skin\n* Easily absorbed\n* Though I don’t know why you would, DON’T CONSUME. Can be very dangerous\n* Has anti-ageing properties\n* Can be used to treat eczema, razor rash and sunburn\n\n**Argan Oil**\n\n* Golden brown in colour\n* Smells vaguely nutty – if it doesn’t smell very nutty it’ll be diluted cheap stuff and won’t help you\n* Very popular as a multi-use for skin and hair\n* One of the thinner oils but a little goes a long way\n* Absorbs quickly\n* Can be used effectively around the eyes\n* A favourite with respected skin care bloggers\n* Moisturising and can even out skin tone\n* Described as having a “silky” feel\n\n**Avocado Oil**\n\n* Spectacular for hair\n* Easily available at most supermarkets and shops for cheap\n* Not recommended for skin\n* Comedogenic – can cause blackheads by blocking pores\n* Goes off faster than most oils – will smell horrible and turn dark yellow when it’s off\n\n**Black Cumin Seed Oil**\n\n* Can be very quenching and result in smooth feeling skin\n* Due to its colour it can leave you a slight glow. This can be beneficial to some, but be careful in case it doesn’t work as desired for you\n* Doesn’t often break out people who are prone to acne\n* Smells like toasted nuts with a hint of caramel\n* Similar to Argan oil in consistency – quite thin, not sticky\n\n**Black Raspberry Seed Oil**\n\n* Smells fantastic according to most\n* Light green in colour\n* Full of antioxidants\n\n**Carrot Seed Oil**\n\n* Dark green in colour\n* Very powerful earthy scent – smell can linger so be wary that you may smell like it for a bit\n* If used in its pure form then be sure to dilute it. However, most types of it are macerated. (softened/diluted with liquid)\n* Very rich – not suitable for acne prone or easily irritated skin\n* Has an average absorption rate – will take a while to soak in\n\n**Castor Oil**\n\n* VERY thick and sticky/waxy\n* Is supposed to be great for improving hair growth – including eyelashes, eyebrows, scalp, etc. While this can be beneficial, some people report using it on their skin makes their peach hair darker and similar effects whereas others report no change, so be wary that this may affect you\n* Very drying so MUST be used with something else\n* Works fantastically in lip products to give your lips a glossy appearance\n* There’s so many different types of it that cause such varying effects depending on them that it’s pretty risky\n\n**Coconut Oil**\n\n* Raved about for hair because it’s one of the only two known oils that can penetrate deeply into it, allowing your hair to really be effected by it and not just coated.\n* When used on hair it’s very effective at controlling frizziness\n* Can’t just be rinsed out of hair, must be lathered and rinsed out so if you’re doing a no-shampoo regime or something then don’t use it\n* A riskier oil for skin as while some peoples skin loves it, it can cause horrific break outs in others – especially on the face\n* Refined coconut oil shouldn’t be used. It can be identified due to having barely any smell of coconut – You should only buy unrefined, extra virgin coconut oil for bodily use\n* Said that it can be used to reduce the appearance of skin marks such as Keratosis Pilaris\n* Can even be used on dogs to keep their coats healthy, if that’s a bonus to you\n\n**Emu Oil**\n\n* Mid-range thickness and milky in colour\n* A slightly unfavourable smell but not overpowering (such as Neem Oil)\n* Can be used for hair but isn’t very popular as many people don’t see desired results, so other oils are likely a better choice\n* If used correctly, it can be very hydrating\n* Not vegetarian or vegan at all – it’s emu fat\n* Is supposed to help products penetrate better, reduce inflammation, increase healing and plump your skin\n* Good for dry skin\n\n**Evening Primrose Oil**\n\n* Good for people who are acne prone, have dry skin or eczema\n* Needs diluted\n\n**Extra Virgin Olive Oil**\n\n* Rich\n* One of the thicker liquid oils\n* Effective make-up remover\n* Leaves a “plump and smooth” feeling to the skin\n* Can be very effective at reducing the appearance of SF’s\n\n**Hemp Seed Oil**\n\n* Very, very popular. Especially for use in OCM’s\n* Thin, hydrating and quick to dry down\n* Can be used on its own if it works with your skin – as a cleanser and hydrator/moisturiser\n* Ensure to wear with sunscreen\n* Strange smell - can be off putting for some\n* Green in colour\n\n**Jojoba Oil**\n\n* Dark golden yellow in colour\n* Has an earthy scent\n* Very thick. Feels almost slimy on the skin – described as “liquid wax”\n* Takes a long time to absorb so can feel almost like wearing a face mask\n* Can cause break outs – definitely patch test thoroughly\n* Is another one that can help hair growth, especially eyelashes, so can be added to mascara’s that are drying out to help\n\n**Macadamia Oil**\n\n* mildly comedogenic\n* light\n* fast absorbing\n* slight nutty smell that disappears after a bit\n\n**Mineral Oil**\n\n* Clear\n* Probably one of, if not the, thinnest oils – similar consistency to water\n* Can’t soak into the skin so can only be used as a cleanser/occlusive – better to use a moisturiser with it, but it isn’t drying\n* The least likely oil to break you out, yay! Just make sure to use un-fragranced as the fragrance can break people out. If the fragranced works for you then go for it though. (Fragranced mineral oil is just baby oil)\n* Great make-up remover\n* Probably the most popular for OCM’s\n* Leaves the face feeling very clean\n* Some people say it can make redness more apparent, but this is more specific to the user as others say it reduces redness significantly. As it’s the least likely to break you out, it’s one of the safest to try\n\n**Neem Oil**\n\n* A dark honey colour\n* Can be quite expensive\n* Extremely thick in consistency and solidifies when cold\n* Horrifically bad smelling so not for the light-hearted\n* Incredible for treating acne of all types. Will almost completely clear deep acne in a matter of days, and can do the same for surface acne in as little as 24 hours in some people\n* Despite its strength, it’s quite moisturising which is a benefit over other strong oils such as Tea Tree which can dry you out\n* Contains steroids - same steroids can also be found in many fruits and veg and can be quite beneficial, so don't fear, but just a heads up for anybody who didn't know\n\n**Sea Buckthorn Oil**\n\n* Can help even skin tone and lightening PIH\n* Bright orange in colour – can stain the skin if not careful\n* Can be used to make DIY products\n\n**Squalene Oil**\n\n* Comes in bottle and capsule version\n* Capsule version is thicker and milkier\n* Really good at helping other oils be absorbed\n\n**Sunflower Seed Oil**\n\n* Golden colour\n* Slight scent\n* An effective cleanser similar to extra virgin olive oil, but can be less clogging than it for some people\n\n**Sweet Almond Oil**\n\n* Pale yellow\n* No real smell\n* Softening\n* Doesn’t often cause bad reactions\n* Reasonably thick\n* Great carrier/dilution oil\n\n**Tamanu Oil**\n\n* Very dark green, almost black, in colour\n* Strong nutty scent but isn’t overpowering\n* Reasonably thick\n* Doesn’t absorb immediately, takes a little time but will absorb well if you leave it a little while\n* Analgesic (can relieve pain)\n* Anti-bacterial\n* Due to the above things, it can be very beneficial for acne prone or irritated skin\n\n**Tea Tree Oil**\n\n* Must be used minimally and diluted so as not to dry out or burn the skin – if used without diluting it can make your skin dry and scaly, or burn it badly\n* If used correctly it can make an effective spot treatment. One such method includes making a diluted tea tree and jojoba oil mix.\n* Can be very effective at preventing/clearing clogged pores, whiteheads and the likes\n* Anti-inflammatory properties\n* MUST use with a moisturiser\n* Has a “clean” smell\n\n**Watermelon Seed Oil**\n\n* Light yellow in colour\n* Only has a mild scent\n* Very light\n* Absorbs quickly\n* Can be quite drying so use with a moisturiser, but this makes it beneficial for oily skin\n* Good for irritated skin as it can be calming\n\n*****\n\n###If any lovely person can provide info on the following oils, I'd greatly appreciate it, and the people who requested it would too ;)###\n\n* Rosehip Seed Oil\n* Sesame Seed Oil\n* Vitamin E Oil\n* Vitamin K Oil",

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nFollowing up on the Hacking Kama Ayurveda post [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/iflfoc/hacking\\_kama\\_ayurveda/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/iflfoc/hacking_kama_ayurveda/) \\- here are the highly requested reviews of the products. Used the products for 1 week+. Was planning to visit a Kama store to do a closer comparison but been lazy :D.\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *Am not a very diligent reviewer, roped in my mother for another opinion - so would be great if other people who've also ordered these products can give their feedback.*\n\n**TLDR:** The products overall are good, the oils are stickier. Kama does seem to edit them which makes them great. But for the price difference am personally fine with good.\n\n1. **Amarnath Mishra Rose Water:** Heavenly smell, LOVE IT. Fragrance does seem stronger than the Kama one. **HG.**\n2. **Face Powders - got AVP Lavanya, AVS Nimbadi, AVS Eladi:** Use these with the AM Rose Water - LOVE them and get the most amazing sleep when I'm waiting for it to dry. Face feels cleaner, brighter, spots fading. Not a temporary effect. **HG.**\n3. **AVP Kumkumadi Oil:** Smells the same as Kama, the effect feels the same, roller ball is a pain. *Would be great to get a 2nd/3rd opinion from the community as the difference if any doesn't seem too evident.* **WRP.**\n4. **AVP Nilibrighandi Oil:** Smells stronger and feels stickier - so not an exact clone. I added it to my hair oil mix so was less sticky and my hair does feel softer than before. **WRP.**\n5. **Body Oils - got AVP Nalapramadi, AVS Balaswagadha (Sugandhadi):** Haven't tried the Kama products so can't do a proper comparison. Both are very yellow and very sticky (as per u/kparwal her Kama Nalapramadi is yellow but not sticky). Mother has been using them as a mosquito repellant body oil, I've been using it to fade mosquito bite scars on my body. They do work but being very yellow ends up staining clothes/sheets etc. So might mix it into a body butter or other oils as discussed at [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/imh4k0/has\\_anyone\\_made\\_their\\_own\\_diy\\_body\\_butter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/imh4k0/has_anyone_made_their_own_diy_body_butter/). **Undecided.**\n6. **Moksha oils** \\- just delivered. Will add a review after I've received all the oils.\n7. **MRT oils** \\- pending delivery.\n8. **SOS Organic** \\- pending delivery for Apricot Kernel Oil. Not Kama hacking, but Junaili/Pahadi Local. Also getting teas from them(and Mittal Teas - they supply teas to the Taj hotel group).\n\n**Seller/shipping reviews:**\n\n1. **Amarnath Mishra:** Great experience, bought plastic bottles delivered in a week with screenshots of tracking. Whatsapp person is very friendly and nice. This was before the post went up, believe they have been busier since.\n2. **Ayush Arogyam:** Products delivered in 2 weeks, no major issues but emails were never answered. Will try to find another more responsive seller if possible. *(other users got responses on WhatsApp)*\n3. **Moksha:** Fast delivery - 3 days. Quick responses to queries on IG.\n4. **MRT Organic:** Pending delivery. Pain to get in touch with them about out of stock products, literally hounded them.\n5. **SOS Organic:** Pending delivery. Quick responses to queries on IG.\n6. **Mittal Teas:** Super fast next day delivery. Prompt on WhatsApp. Was told I'd get lots of samples and got *just one*, so was disappointed but then they sent me some more samples the next day even when I told them not to.\n\nHope this helps and would be great if other people who've also ordered these products can give their feedback. 😊🙏\n\n***Part 2 of reviews at:*** https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/irxtiv/hacking_kama_product_reviews_part_2_oils_teas/",

No cleaner, no exfoliation, no moisturizer, and rarely sunscreen. I have been feeling red and stretched (dehydrated skin), so I decided I wanted to try to add some moisturizer. It is not working at all!\n\n**My skin** I rarely get pimples. My skin is a little flaky between my eyebrows, and tends to get dehydrated over the winter, so I think it is dry, but overall pretty balanced. My main issue is ***sensitivity***.  When I get out of the shower, my face is bright red, hot and even a little stingy sometimes. When I put anything on my face (sunscreen, moisturizer), same feeling (lasts for maybe an hour most of the time). When I clean my face with oatmeal, it gets red and hot but no stinging. You get the idea.\n\n**What I have tried** Cerave in the tub, Aveeno Ultra Calming, some curel repair lotion-- all stingy, and my face feels red and hot and not at all moisturized.  The cerave tended to be too heavy and itchy, but at least it did seem to leave my skin not feeling stretched or dry. The other two left my skin rough and chapped feeling, way worse than it was before!\n\nOCM with apricot kernel oil-- no stinging, but my face did get itchy. I think that the manual stimulation from my fingertips set off the redness and a little heat. Left my skin very shiny!\n\n**what I want** some sort of cream that I can put on my face that will feel very cool and non-irritating, and will soothe my skin. Hopefully, it will also moisturize/ help me to repair my skin barrier.\n\nI am on the verge of giving up and just going back to water cleansing and dehydrated skin, please help!",

And it may be that products that are water based are getting into the epidermis and causing the stinging. I know that when the backs of my hands are dry and on the verge of cracking, a water based lotion stings and makes them red and blotchy. Try using an oil based cream (the only one I can think of off the top of my head is QV Intensive Body Moisturiser, not sure how easy it is to get outside of Australia though. Try using vaseline). After your skin and moisture barrier is repaired then regular water based lotions shouldn't sting.",

        "body": "Sounds like rosacea. Red skin, highly sensitive skin, sensitive to heat, sensitive to touch, chapping, dry. Yup.\n\nSee a dermatologist. They will prescribe a topical, most likely metronidazole gel, lotion or cream. They may also prescribe a prescription vitamin combo Nicomide (which works for me). They will prolly recommend washing with something like Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser (not to be confused with Cetaphil facial skin cleanser, the gentle is milder.) Another alternative for cleansing is Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Cleanser which is like gel and is very soothing if you're raw. Just be careful squeezing it out of the tube, it comes out too fast.\n\nBoth Cetaphil and Eucerin make moisturizers for rosacea skin. Cetaphil also makes one with sunblock, something else you're going to need. Personally I prefer sunblock with zinc oxide and or titanium. Wear a hat outdoors and wear sunblock.\n\nSo your routine would be cleanse (with cool water), medicate, moisturize, sunblock. \n\nSome people have tried oil cleansing method for rosacea with good results. I have not tried it. Be aware that some oils make rosacea worse so research OCM thoroughly before you try it. Some oils are also good for \ngiving your moisturizer and extra boost. Again, research what aggravates rosacea and what doesn't.\n\nStay away from things that irritate rosacea, like hot water, alcohol, witch hazel. Stay away from things that make your face flush.

Im starting to believe the moisturizer is slowing the skin's production of oils and moisture because it's getting it from lotions and creams. \n\nI've tried all the same creams and lotions as you and nothing has worked. Just made it worse like you. Let me know if you solved the problem and what treatments you used. \nAll the best.",

        "body": "Skin cells need to be removed by manual exfoliation by a scrub, enzyme, or AHA liquid or pad form, and to be hydrated after.  If you moisturize your skin before while dead cells rest on the surface the product cant get in the tissue very well.  Its perfectly fine to feel a sensation with this process.  A little itch or tingle and a healthy pink hue in the skin is normal while exfoliating. You are stimulating blood flow while you are doing this.  A thing or two about moisturizers is that the thicker they are the bigger the molecule, the lighter and thinner consistency the smaller.  Serums absorb much better in the skin than moisturizers.  Moisturizers sit mainly on the skin and don't really get into the deeper layers of the skin. Find a serum base product or a lighter cream.  Arcona Chamomile Balm will soothe your skin irritation and hydrate you at the same time. Perhaps also their Berry Bar for sensitive skin, or the Kiwi Cream Bar for dry skin.  Also before you put your serum on, spray some heavy water on the skin  to seal in more moisture, then apply your serum.",

    "body": "Hey all!! I had posted not too long ago requesting help finding a dupe for my now discontinued lip balm, the Bite Agave Lip Mask. I took recommendations and compromised on some of my wishlist for ingredients, as I realized no one else makes a balm with an identical ingredient list. I figured in case anyone else is struggling with replacing this, I'd share what I found. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It too got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. Its good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. Its a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. Its a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, its going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!!",

I love Ultraplant but it's pretty expensive so that's my way of making it last. I bought 9 to 5 a while ago but i just don't feel like it's very cleansing, maybe because it doesn't foam? I really just feel as though I'm splashing colored white water on my face then rinsing it off. So i really disliked it as a cleanser but i *did* find that it worked great as a gentle eyeliner remover. So, i saved up the rest of the (mostly full) bottle to use as eyeliner remover. I don't even wear eyeliner that often so it's going to last me a really long time. \n\nI also needed something stronger to help remove my stubborn matte lipstick I'm always struggling with, and i was happy to find that jade roller works really well to get the worst of it off.",

    "body": "Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm\n\nYeesh...this review has been a really hard one to put together. \n\nIn my own head I feel like “If I see one more post proclaiming the amazing power of this product I am going to scream!”\n\nAnd I have totally been part of that group...maybe not so much the overt praise...but the Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm has popped up a number of times on my social media when showing my current evening routine.\n\nAll that being said and even with the overabundance of hype, the thing is...this is a damn good cleansing balm.\n\nFeaturing Apricot Kernel Oil, Camellia Seed Oil, and Papaya Seed Oil...the Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm has a smooth texture and dispenses from the jar without becoming chunky.\n\nOn the skin the product melts down incredibly well and turns into a heavy but manageable oil. I find myself really taking my time to massage the product in and enjoy the slightly fruity scent. This balm breaks through sunscreen (I am not a makeup wearer) very well. \n\nUpon rinsing though, I noticed that this product does take a bit more work to completely remove. This is especially true around the eye area or anywhere there was a heavier layer of product. \n\nIt still emulsifies like other cleansing balms...it just takes a bit more work than I am used to.\n\nBut once it is rinsed the Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm leaves behind a wonderfully soft yet thoroughly cleansed feel to the skin. I’ve also noticed some mild smoothing and texture balancing over time that I don't think I can say any other first step cleanser has provided.\n\nBecause of the lack of synthetic fragrance, PEG (in their most commonly known forms), and essential oils...I can see why this product has been an instant hot item. It plays into everything today’s skincare area is focusing on.\n\nI really think the issues I had with rinsing/removing could have been avoided had Glow Recipe left in some of the more common emulsifying ingredients. That is 100% personal preference, I know you may feel different, which is why I still think this is an excellent product for some.\n\nWhen it comes to an effective cleansing balm that rinses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling soft, non-irritated, and generally looking awesome...the crown still goes to the Then I Met You Living Cleansing Balm.\n\nI adore that product for its lovely/creamy/buttery texture, smooth application, and wonderful scent. Nothing else I have used has quite met the same bar (although several have come really close).\n\nThe Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm is a masterclass in taking what consumers are asking for...and creating something really special and results driven. While I do like nearly everything about it, the Living Cleansing Balm is still where my heart (and my wallet) remain.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Sorbitan Oleate, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Polyethylene, Aqua/Water/Eau, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Papain, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Alkanna Tinctoria Root Extract, Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Levulinic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Metabisulfite\n\nWhere To Buy (Glow Recipe Site $32.00 USD): [https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm](https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79jphcm9vfi51.jpg?width=5216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17013139413be2982c0414b35a019f535fbd0362",

    "body": "Hi Everyone! I have recently taken it upon myself to purchase and review body oils from many many different indie brands. I originally was going to post this as one big post but I have gathered so many oils and have so many opinions on them that I think it's best to break it up a little bit into a few different posts as I go along. If there's any oils you want to see reviewed, please let me know and I will do my best to get my hands on some. \n    \n**About my skin:** I have very dry, eczema prone skin. I have had psoriasis in the past but do not currently. I am sensitive on the inside of my elbows and behind my knees where the skin is thin.   \n  \n**What I like:** You will notice I prefer a bit of a thicker oil. I know this is not always everyones preference so I have also reviews some thinner oils. I try all the oils in the same way: Coating my body head to toe and sleeping with the oil on my skin. In the morning, my skin will either feel adequately moisturized  or still a bit dry.\n    \n**Sucreabeille (4oz = 8.00 USD, +/- 2.00 USD/oz)**  \n**Body Oil** (The Listing Attic: spiced apple cider, maple sugar, Kentucky bourbon)  \n**Ingredients:** Sunflower Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance/Essential Oil.  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** This is a good one. I love a true oil to wear, but want something that absorbs quickly. This fits that bill, coating my skin nicely but absorbing in about 15/20 minutes. Skin was very soft in the morning when I woke up. Wish this came in a dropper or spray (it’s one of those caps where you push the back down and it pops up to dispense, this formula is thick enough that you have to squeeze the bottle a bit, it won’t run out on its own).   **Also a note, the owner of Sucreabeille has moved her house blends to be their own brand now. Sucreabeille still exists but is used for her copycat / dupe scents. Her new brand “Hexennacht” carries this scent, and from what I can tell the same formula of body oil (ingredients list is the same).**  \n**Scent:** Ooooh, she’s a boozy one! Off the bat, out of the bottle, I get strong apple bourbon. On the skin, it’s a really even combination of all 3 elements, very balanced. I like it a lot, but I don’t think I’d wear it as a perfume. Really nice scent for Fall / Winter. Nothing left on my skin in the morning after sleeping with this on.  \n  \n**Exoskeletons (1oz = 24.00 USD, +/- 24.00 USD/oz)**  \n**Skin Elixir** (Tobacco: A balanced blend of sweetness and smoke. Blackened spices, deep dark vanilla, sweet resins, and charred wood. Smells like mahogany, like brass, like bookshelves filled with e.e. cummings, like a jukebox singing the blues.)  \n**Ingredients:** jojoba oil, fractionated coconut oil, rosehip oil, castor oil, coq10, alpha lipoic acid, essential oil blend, vitamin e, infused with organic cloves.   \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I do like this formula as far as moisture and application. It goes on very nicely, is easy to spread, and I credit this product with turning my rough elbows baby soft in one application. This does not sink in as quickly as the Sucreabeille, in fact I think it’s the thickest oil I’ve tried so far. The only reason I won’t repurchase is because of the price. Of course, this has the nicest packaging out of everything, imo, which explains probably a lot of the higher cost.  \n**Scent:** Very strong. I believe this is a polarizing scent as although I love it, I have made a few people smell it who were either equally appreciative or a little bit revolted. This is mainly a strong clove. If I put this on before bed, the next day when I come home from work my entire room still smells of cloves.   \n  \n**Solstice Scents (4oz = 16.00 USD, +/- 4.00 USD/0z)**  \n**Burnishing Glacé** (Jack and the Devil: Jack & The Devil is part trick, part treat and all autumn delight. A blend of sugared golden pumpkin, spices, oakmoss, sweet vanilla, aged patchouli essential oil, and dried brown tobacco leaves [absolute]. )  \n**Ingredients:** Cyclomethicone NF, Fragrance and / or essential oil(s), Argan Oil, Rice Bran Oil  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I just wish this was more hydrating. It’s a nice, very light spray. I prefer to spray into my hand and then rub into skin as I find spraying directly results in some waste when the spray doesn’t hit your skin directly. This would be a better formula for summer, when my skin is not as dry. I like this for hair as well, but I don’t find the scent lingers in hair as much as it does on skin. I will most likely use this as a bath oil, which I will follow up with something thicker.  If you prefer a dry oil, that will absorb completely very quickly, this oil is for you.   **I do want to mention that I did have a little active eczema on the inside of elbow when using this, and it did sting a bit. Not enough that I washed it off, not enough that I stopped using it, but it did. This is something that Solstice Scents warns of on their website, since this is a spicy fragrance. I will continue to use it, but if you suffer from eczema or Psoriasis, I would take note.**   \n**Scent:** Scent is very strong on this one. Lasts nicely on the skin (though not in hair, for me), and this is one of my favourite indie scents for fall. Spicy, sweet, a little gourmand, a little masculine. Can smell it very faintly on my skin the next day, if applied before bed.  \n  \n**Cocoa Pink Silky Soft Body Oil (Greasy formula) (2 oz=5.80 USD, +/- 2.90 USD/oz)**\n(Winchester House Kitchen: The distinct aroma of autumn in the Winchester house kitchen with notes of aged oak, fresh baked pumpkin pie, 5 fold orange essential oil coated in the warm essence of light muscovado sugar, fresh ginger, sticky gobs of benzoin, warm buttery caramel simmering on the stovetop and just the barest hint of clove)  \n**Ingredients:** Sweet Almond Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Fragrance oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Olive Squalene, Jojoba Oil, Rice Bran Oil (greasy formula), Avocado Oil (greasy formula).  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I reaaaaaally like this formula you guys. As soon as I started using it I thought to myself “THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT”. This one definitely has to be sprayed into your hand because it just comes out as kind of a glop, not a spray. NBD because that’s how I apply them anyways. Really moisturizing, soaked in after about 10-15 minutes, and I woke up and my skin was soooo nice and soft. When I finish up all of these body oils, this is one I will definitely repurchase, in a few different scents.  \n**Scent:** Not at all what I expected! I kind of thought this was going to smell similar to Cinderella’s Carriage, based on the pumpkin, sugar, etc. but I barely get any sweetness at all. I get mainly ginger and aged oak (HONESTLY, I kind of get “recently polished wood furniture”) and when I woke up the next morning the slightest hint of caramel (could be in my head). Never got any orange. I don’t love it but I don’t hate it, and it doesn’t really linger so that’s fine.  \n\nWhew! Let me know if you have any questions about these scents or formulas. I have a lot more reviews to come: Epically Epic, Queen Bee, Alchemic Muse, Witch Baby... and some more Cocoa  Pink! Let me know if there are any formulas you would like to see me compare :)\n\n\n**Edit: Some formatting**",

    "body": "#Why use oils in your hair?\n\nPlant oils are emollients used to soften hair or add “plasticity” or pliability. Pliable hair bends easily without breaking. Hair with oils applied to it lines up better with neighboring hairs thanks to the lubricating properties of oils (slip).\n\nWhen water absorbs into hair strands, the inside (cortex) swells but the outside (cuticle) cannot expand. This causes the cuticles to raise, in this position cuticles can break off, make hair more porous, and cause protein loss. Oils that are penetrating can help prevent this by making hair more water-phobic (water-repelling), preventing swelling from occurring. Penetrating oils can cause shorter dry-times.\n\nKeeping hair hydrated and moisturized helps with the health of your hair, prevents tangles, and helps the longevity of a hairstyle. Water will condition hair and adding water-based products like leave-in conditioner will help hydrate hair. To help your hair keep this hydration, sealing oils can be added to help prevent this moisture from leaving your hair. Sealing oils add shine, gloss, and lubrication to your hair.\n\n#Ways to use oils\n\n1) Oil pre-poo: Apply oil to your hair and leave it on for 4-12 or more hours before shampooing. The oil prevents dehydration and loss of proteins and protects and buffers your hair from water and shampoo. If you get the amount of oil and leave-on time right, your hair will be more flexible and feel softer, better lubricated and your curls will be better-defined. The longer you leave the oil on, the more oil will work its way into your hair.\n\n2) Added to a deep or intense conditioning treatment.\n\n3) To seal damp hair. You need some leave-on conditioner over your oil or a nice film-forming gel like flaxseed gel for hydration – oil alone does not hydrate your hair.\n\n4) Oil rinsing. Either mix 1/4 oil and 3/4 conditioner or 1/2 oil and 1/2 conditioner and use this as you would a rinse-out conditioner. Or apply the oil to clean, wet hair, then apply conditioner and squeeze and gently massage the oil and conditioner together in your hair. Then rinse and enjoy the very soft result.\n\n#Oil charts by penetration\n\nCredit to W.S. of [science-yhairblog](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com) for these awesome charts!\n\nThis top chart is oils that have been demonstrated in lab tests to penetrate the hair, and which should based on their chemistry. They are high in triglycerides and/or contain monosaturated lipids which can penetrate below cuticles. \n\n| Oils with high penetration | Penetration improves with heat? | Documented by research |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Coconut oil                        | Yes                                               | Yes, excellent                  |\n| Ucuuba butter                    | Unknown                                     | Yes, good                        |\n| Sunflower oil                     | Yes                                               | Yes, depending on study |\n| Palm kernel oil                   | Likely                                          | No                                   |\n| Capric/Caprylic triglycerides   | Unknown                                 | No                                   |\n| Babbasu oil                         | Possible                                       | No                                   |\n\nThis chart is oils with some penetration. These are arranged based on their lipid composition from more likely to penetrate (top of that list) to less likely at the bottom of that list. \n\n| Oils with some penetration | Penetration improves with heat? | Documented by research |\n|--------|------------|--------|\n| Castor oil    | Unknown       | No   |\n| Olive oil    | Possible     | Yes, good  |\n| Avocado oil   | Possible     | No |\n| Corn oil   | Possible     | No |\n| Canola oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Mustard seed oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Sweet almond  | Unknown    | No |\n| Apricot kernel oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Argan oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Sesame seed oil   | Unknown    | No |\n| Shea butter  | Unknown     | No |\n| Peanut oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Kokum butter   | Unknown    | No |\n| Grapeseed oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Rose hip oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Hemp seed oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Flax seed (linseed) oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Perilla oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Safflower oil   | Unknown     | No |\n| Cocoa butter   | Unknown     | No |\n\nThis last chart is oils which do not penetrate the hair based on lab tests and/or their chemistry.\n\n| Oils with little/no penetration | Penetration improves with heat? | Documented by research |\n|--------|------------|--------|\n| Rice bran oil    | Unknown       | Poor penetration  |\n| Mineral oil    | -     | No penetration  |\n| Jojoba oil   | -     | No penetration |\n\n#Quick recommendations\n\nPenetrating oils for managing porosity and softness: Coconut oil, fractionated coconut oil, sunflower oil, babassu oil, olive oil, avocado oil, palm kernel oil, a blend of these oils and any others you like. Castor oil is good for some people's hair.\n\nSealing oils for slip and flexibility: Broccoli seed oil, jojoba oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil.\n\n#Does this oil work for my hair?\n\nGood oils for your hair: A good oil for your hair will add a little sheen, a smoother feel, and ease of detangling. Your hair will still have that sheen and smoothness hours later. You may need to re-apply the oil at some point between washes, but your hair should not be worse off after using the oil.\n\nOils that don't work for your hair: Limp, flat hair means your hair doesn't get along well with an oil or you used too much. Some bad signs are if your hair becomes dry, frizzy, waxy, brittle, tangly, stiff, crunchy or dull-looking. This may happen right away, or it may occur over the course of many hours, days, or weeks.\n\n##Hair gets crunchy or stiff or brittle with coconut oil (or another oil)?\n\nSome people get crunchy or brittle hair or rigid hair from coconut oil with its unusual fatty acid profile and saturated fat content. Try blending coconut oil with other oils or use a different oil like sunflower oil or babassu oil. Just about any oil can disagree with somebody's hair and create an unpleasant result.\n\n#Further Reading / References\n\nS, W. (2013, June 24). Oils – Which Ones Soak In vs. Coat the Hair?.

This mixture not only made my hair noticeably softer and shinier but also managed to reduce frizz to a significant extent. It was a mix including some of the penetrating and sealing oils you've listed, like coconut, olive, sunflower and jojoba. In addition, it was an easy routine to follow, as it only required a few drops massaged into my hair after shampooing and conditioning, then left on as a leave-in treatment. It's all about finding what works for your hair, but this product could be a good place to start, especially if you're interested in introducing a blend of oils into your hair care routine.

    "body": "**Video Link:**\n\n[Click Here](https://youtu.be/Q5NC946YGCs)\n\n**Disclosure Statement:**\n\nEleven Shaving provided a sample of the soap for review.\n\n**Write-up**:\n\nA few weeks ago I thought of how much I enjoyed using Eleven’s soap base during the Lather Games back in June. I reached out to Eleven to ask some questions about their products, and owner Paolo kindly offered to send me a sample of [Barbershop](https://elevenshaving.com/collections/shave-soap/products/barbershop-shave-soap) (link to Eleven's site).  This is his newest scent creation as well as the first soap to be featured in the new Julien base.\n\nPaolo told me he had been working on a barbershop scent for some time now, and the scent went through many variations before arriving at this version. It has a fairly typical list of barbershop scent notes including bergamot, rosemary, oakmoss, patchouli, sandalwood, and powdery musk. This scent smells “classic” to me and is certainly a familiar scent from my youth, but it does not feel redundant or too similar to other artisan barbershop soaps that I have smelled in the past. The scent strength is medium off of my sample tub, and it’s definitely a winner for me.\n\nThe new Julien soap base looks to improve on what the original 11.0 base already started by improving slickness and post-shave performance. The only new ingredient to the soap base is kokum better, while the other differences only exist in ingredient ratios.  Julien is a tallow-based soap and also includes nice ingredients like shea butter, mango butter, kokum better, silk, grapeseed oil, and apricot kernel oil. The ingredients list does not skimp on materials, but it doesn’t feel gratuitous either.\n\nI had no issues working with this soap base during the week. I used a badger knot for a couple shaves, and a synthetic for a couple, including in today’s video. The Julien base is a soft croap, so it loads easily into a brush, and it didn’t seem to matter if I started with a dry or wet brush. This base stands out to me as having a puffier, higher structure lather compared to the usual artisan soaps I use (though not as much as what I remember of the 11.0 base), and it wasn’t lacking at all in terms of primary slickness, residual slickness, or post-shave feel. In a crowded artisan soap marketplace, Eleven’s new Julien base stands out to me as being incredibly easy to lather and work with, yet still performs at a high level where it is nearly impossible to find things to complain about. The Barbershop soap retails for $16 for 4 ounces of soap, which is not bad compared to other soaps these days.\n\nAs always, thank you all for reading my reviews and watching my videos. Happy Holidays!",

Lauren, the owner and man behind the soap making is an avid reader. Reading provides a respite from the stresses of life and his hope is that Storybook Soapworks hand crafted soaps and post shave products will do the same for its users. It has been quite some time since I have used a Storybook Soapworks product. This particular offering is a part of a trilogy created by various artisans for the Reddit sub, r/wetshaving. The scent was designed by the famed fragrance house, Chatillon Lux ([https://chatillonlux.com/](https://chatillonlux.com/)). Storybook Soapworks can be purchased direct from their website or at  Maggard Razors ([www.maggardrazors.com](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)).\n\nWest Egg named for the city of the newly-rich from the Great Gatsby, is a whimsical scent featuring scent notes of: white grapes and sparkling aldehydes. The culmination of these notes represents the smell of champagne. To my nose, this is an accurate recreation of the bubbly drink that signifies celebration. The scent is vibrant and fun, it is approachable and feels almost unisex for use. Mrs. Ruds likes the scent. While she does not find it sexy or masculine, she approves of casual ring. Strength of scent is mid out of the soap tub and remains this way once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends the Chatillon Lux eau de parfum as a complimentary scent profile.\n\nStorybook Soapworks uses a tallow based soap featuring listed ingredients of: Stearic Acid, Water, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Fragrance, Shea Butter, Vegetable Glycerin, Rice Bran Oil, Avocado Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Sodium Lactate, Tocopherol. The soap is soft and therefore care should be taken to ensure it is not overloaded. The soap is of above average thirst, but not the thirstiest soap out there. When properly hydrated and dialed in, the resulting lather will display the consistency of sour cream. Both primary and residual slickness are very good. While short of the upper tier soaps in terms of slickness, it gets the job done without any problems. Post shave is protective and nourishing to the skin. The post shave, like the slickness is very good. Storybook Soapworks soap base is more than a serviceable base in terms of performance and as such receives a ShaveScore of 88. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest: Purely Skinful Handmade Essentials and Stubble Buster.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Storybook Soapworks West Egg (loaner)\n* Brush - DS Cosmetics “Gel Tip” (promotional gift)\n* Razor - Boker “Elite” (gift)\n* Post - Chatillon Lux West Egg (loaner)",

Maybe I am crazy, but I get two different coffee scents from the soap, both good, and **very good** together. The soap is tallow-based, but also includes rice bran oil, avocado oil, and apricot kernel oil. The soap lathers easily, with excellent slickness and glide. The lather is shiny and creamy and also feels lighter, less \"fat-heavy\", than some of the soaps I have used lately. Post shave is excellent, and the soap rinses off cleanly. *Very nice soap!* I really enjoyed my shaves all week - great stuff!\n\nThe aftershave is an alcohol-free splash with witch hazel as the primary ingredient. The scent is still very strong in the aftershave, with more of the cold brew scent to me, and the scent is short-lived. You need just a bit of the aftershave, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how good my skin felt after use. It dries down almost immediately, with no sticky or tacky feel, and my skin felt soft and supple. Recommended!\n\nThe Schick Injector is the closest thing I have to a cartridge razor in terms of the overall shave. Zero issues with blade control here: the blade is held perfectly in place and the angle makes for a very comfortable, if not very efficient, shave. I can fly through a shave with this razor and never feel that I am in any danger of razor burn or nicks. The blade seems to go and go, but I will have to find out later just how many shaves I can get out of this one. If you have never tried an Injector, you really should - beautiful shaves!!\n\n**If you read all this way**\n\nI have enjoyed the various posts detailing the ups and downs of 2017, and just wanted to thank all of you that had the courage to post your personal stories. For those of us that have had those really down years, it can be hard to be honest with others about just how shitty the year has been. Chin up, things get better...",

I thought I'd give some information to everyone on how to properly buy or identify a good grade essential oil. I've supplied a lot of information =] hope some of it makes some sense.\n\nI have this similar post, not as detailed in some other subreddits, but someone suggested I post it again here, so here it is! With more to wrap your brain around.\n\nJust for the record, I am not a certified aromatherapist. The course is ridiculously expensive.. maybe one day. But I am a firm believer in the use of essential oils as well as herbalism. If anyone has any questions on either, I can try my best to help answer with what I know. Or if someone else here is certified aromatherapist or herbalist it would be great to hear from you :) I have many questions!\n\nI am supplying the information I received from some aromatherapy courses, as well as some of my own research since then. So please, do not hold any of my methods, blends ideas accountable for anything. Everything is at your own risk. You should always consult a certified aromatherapist if you are looking to use EO for medicinal use. They can be very dangerous if you don't know the specificity for each oil. There are some oils that cannot be used with pregnant ladies, certain diseases/conditions. Skin sensitivities can be a hazard as well.\n\nIf you are planning to use essential oils on your own, just remember **Always use smaller concentrations with animals and children! Always dilute your oils, unless specified by a certified aromatherapist**\n\nFirst I want to start by saying, I live in Canada.. so we are a part of the Canadian Federation of Aromatherapy (CFA)\n\nThere are many factors that can determine whether or not you are getting legit good grade essential oils. Once you read through this post, it should be clear as to why some oils can be so expensive. Fun fact: It takes about 60000 roses to produce just 1 ounce of rose oil :)\n\n**3 models of aromatherapy** \n\n**-** German emphasizes inhalation of EO\n\n**-** British is very conservative, support high level dilution, no emphasis on therapeutic grade oils\n\n**-** French proactive and support NEAT (direct skin use). Rely strongly on scientific studies, emphasizes therapeutic uses.\n\n**3 Factors to grow the best crop** – Take into consideration for purchasing essential oils (EO)\n\n**-** grown with no pollution.\n\n**-** Harvested properly. Only oil pockets should be harvested not the whole plant.\n\n**-** Harvested when yield is highest.\n\n**Facts about Essential oils you may not know:**\n\n - A bottle of EO only needs 3-5% of actually essential oil to be labeled 'pure' which is why its important to research the brands quality.\n\nOil pockets are specific to each plant they are found in. A plant grown one place will be different to another.\n\n** Extraction methods**\n\nCO2 extracted – not for medicinal use\n\nSteam extracted – is the best. You should only purchase and use this.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAllergic reactions to scents usually come from synthesized material used in place of oil. \n\nAll plants have their own antidotes, there’s no allergens to pure oil. \n\nSandalwood tree grows 50 years before it can be harvested. Forest fires have limited the production of this EO.\n\n*It's always nice to incorporate a drop of a persons 'essence' into their blend. Eg; a showy person, likes attention – they may like cinnamon. A down to earth person – Thyme.*\n\n\n****Quality control***\n\n*What to look for and ask to see when buying oils. If the seller doesn’t have the information, or isn't sure what you mean...* **DO NOT BUY!**\n\n**Botanical name** – normally on the front of the bottle ie. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) Always *Always* Make sure to check the botanical name, there are sometimes mulitple types of one plant and they can be VERY different, for instance, the regular lavendar you know is called lavendar officinalis, but there is also a Lavendar lespica.. it smells different and is used for a stimulant (complete opposites!)\n\n**Geographical location** – where the plant was harvested from\n\n**Plant harvest** – Wild is best. It has natural fighting instincts, making its biochemical make up stronger. \n\n**Stage of development** – if the plant was at its highest peak when harvested\n\n**Distilled organ** – not usually worried about in North America\n\n**Mode of extraction** – You always want steam distilled\n\n**Biochemical specificity** - Designation of biochemical specificity is critical in knowing what unique characteristics are available for therapeutic uses and specific purposes. For example, there are several forms of essential oil of Thyme, each having its own therapeutic benefits and uses. Knowing the distinctions can keep you and your family safe, and benefiting from the wisdom of the ages. [site explaining gas chromatography and steam distillation](http://www.frre.utn.edu.ar/quimobi/clean/files/get/item/1870)\n \n\nThis may seem tricky to begin with, but look these things up online and you will learn better, or take a weekend aromatherapy course :)\n\n**Modes of use**\n\n*topical* – most common\nfor Massage, compresses, hand/foot bath, regular bath. If you are using oils in a path, place your salts/oils/oats ect in cheesecloth to hold everything together. \n\n    Always dilute with skin sensitivities.\n\n    Don't use petroleum based oils, mineral oils, or baby oil they decrease the absorption on skin.\n\n    Essential oils don't mix well with water, they need a medium. Vodka or witch hazel work good, as does any sort of oil – olive, apricot, sweet almond ect.\n\n    Always mix your oils in glass, it can eat through plastic. Once it is mixed with a medium it is alright for plastic containers.\n\n**Aerosols** – affect the limbic system\n**Always use a GLASS diffuser**\n\n    Oil goes through the glass and adamises through the air.\n\n    Heating oils – heat kills the biochems therefore leaving no therapeutic effect, but smells nice\n\n    using pads – all the biochemicals evaporate, leaving only a nice scent.\n\n    Plastic – oils eat through plastic. Not a good idea\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, diluted EO's don't eat plastic, so blends in blastic are ok!\n\n**Cooking** – helps increase flavour, add it right before serving, don't cook the EO. And you only need a drop or two in each personal serving. A little goes a long way.\n\n    Try these – 1 drop of basil on a bowl of chili\n\n    mix 1 drop of ginger in with sugar for sprinkling on gingersnaps\n    \n    peppermint EO in icing for cakes, cookies ect.\n    \n    Peppermint or sweet orange in a cup of hot chocolate. \n\n**Gardening**  \n\nYou can line a garden bed (or plant pots) with a string soaked in a diluted citrus essential oil. \nI don't have much experience with this area, but certain EO's can keep birds away from berries, pests away from trees.. :) you can also use certain EO's on pets to keep ticks away, thyme is one of them! \n\n\n    A nice carpet cleaner/pwder I use before vaccuming – 1 cup of baking soda, 20 drops total of (top)sweet orange, (mid)bergamot, (base) eucalyptus. Sprinkle it all around and let it sit for up to an hour, its safe to walk on I sometimes move it around with my feet. Then vacuum it up! Sometimes I sprinkle EO into my vacuum bag too for a nice scent. \n\n    Floor washing – 1/2c vinegar, with a mixture of orange, grapefruit, eucalyptus\n\n\n*Fragrance notes are based on volatility and viscosity.* This is what gives you Top Mid and Base notes. Lighter oils are top notes meaning they will disappear quicker you add moire of this, where base notes stay and linger, you need less of this one. [site with good information on fragrance notes and much more](http://www.essentialoils.co.za/fragrance-notes.htm#Holistic%20and%20alternative%20medicine)\n\nTop notes: evaporate quickest, increase the # of drops, most stimulating\n\nMid notes: Balancer, increase concentration\n\nBase notes: Smell last, is strongest, dont use a lot, sedative/fixative in the blend.\n\n    A good ratio to use Top4 Mid3 Base1, and apply that to your carrier\n    More ratios If you're wanting something from an acute problem use 10 drops, ratio 1 top 2 mid.\n*Chronic: 7 drops total 2 mid 1 base*\n*Synergistic: 8 drops 1 top 1 mid*\n\n**Here is a Blending guide:**\n\nFor **normal dilution - which is 2.5%**\n\nx amount of carrier oil - divide by 2 = drops of essential oil\nfor example: 20ml carrier oil / 2 = 10 drops.\n\nExample of a 2.5% blend - 5 sandalwood, 3 lavendar, 2 orange in 20ml apricot kernel oil.\n\n**Low dilution 1% for sensitive skin and pregnancy** (always check with a certified aromatherapist or someone of alternative medicine before using when pregnant, for children or babies)\n\nX amount carrier oil in ml - divide by 4 = essential oil drops\n\n**Extremely low dilution, sensitive skin, children, babies**\n1 drop : 10 ml Or use sweet almond oil by itself.\n\n**Some nice blends:**\n\nClary sage + ylangylang – calming\n\nLemon grass – 10 drops in a hotel(or house) tub to help \ncleans air, make it really hot so the room steams up.\n\nGrapefruit – brings joy helps with releasing grief\n\nThyme – gets rid of ticks\n\nLemon – cleansing. Good to diffuse in the air when cleaning, or use in household cleansers\n\nBasil + lavender – helps with insomnia\n\ngeranium – increases ambiance, brings conversation to a party when diffused in air.\n\nClarysage – helps with painful periods, dysmenorrhea\n\nThyme, lineol, honey – good for coughs\n\nnettle herb and rosemary – gives hair a nice effect\n\nwintergreen, lemongrass – good for arthritis relief\n\npatchouli – great for skin in general\n\nvitivere + grapefruit – I just really like this one lol\n\ncitronella, peppermint, lemongrass – repel bugs/ants\n\n\nconsiderations when blending: [Carrier oil info and shelf lives](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html)\n\n**oil chemistry:** volatility, viscolsity and properties.\n\nDesired therapeutic action – blending correctly allows synergistic affect in the blend (action of oils increase by mixing together)\n\nsequence of blend – changing the sequence of blending can chance the bichem properties and smell\n\nBase oils: It's nice to use a mixture of different base oils here's some general information about some different oils, this info is easy to find anywhere on the internet though.\n\n    *All purpose oils – used for cosmetics, massage, fragrant baths. Oils listed below:*\n\nApricot kernel – high mineral and vitamins, natural moisturizer. Light texture, increases penetrative qualities.\n\nSunflower – Fine. Good for massage blends, high in vitamin E\n\nSweet almond – Soothing, softening properites. Good for babies.\n\nGrapeseed – Good for oily skin.\n\n    *Special carrier oils: help increase skin penetration, nourish dry dehydrated skin, increase a lifespan of oil blends.* \n\nCarrot oil – lots of vitamins, A especailly.. helps with tanning careful it can stain.\n\nSesame – 85% unsaturated 15% saturated fat. Used as additive to enrich other oils.\n\nAvocado – lots of vit A, B, lecithin, protiens, fats, gives soft skin, absorbs easy.\n\nJojoba – long shelf life, thicken reams, resembles skins natural sebum. Suitable for face.\n\nWheatgerm – rich and viscous. Strong smell. Use 10-20% ratio to other oils to prevent rancidity.\n\n\n**Chemistry** [site reference](http://www.experience-essential-oils.com/chemistry-of-essential-oil.html)\n\nThis may be a bit in depth. But its useful information if you wanna get more serious about your oils!\n\nTherapeutic oil has no propylene glycol or petrochemicals\n\nmain groups of compounds in EO's are hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds which are further divided...\n\n*monoterpenes:* – inhibit accumulation of toxins, detox kidneys, liver. Enhance therapeutic values of other compounds, balancing.\n\n*High in monoterpenes: Grapefruit, orange, baloomfir*\n\n*Phenolics* – stimulate the nervous system and immune system. Clean receptor sites for cells so faulty information can be deleted from the cell. Antioxidants, increase oxygenating molecules, anti-infectious, anti-bacterial, antiseptic\n\n*High in phenolic – wintergreen, clove, teatree*\n\n*Alcohols* – increase resistance to oxidation. Ability to revert cells to their normal function, anti infectious/viral/bacteraial.\n\n*high in alcohols: rosewood, geranium, rose otto*\n\n*Esters* – reaction of alcohol and acid. Most relaxing, calming, balancing. Regulate the nervous sytem. Anti-fungal decrease inflamation and spasm.\n\n*High in esters: bergamot, valerian, roman chammomile*\n\n* Aldehydes* – Delightful fragrances. Antiviral, inflammation, calms nervous system, helps decrease blood pressure, relieves stress.\n\n*High in aldehydes: cinnamon bark, lemon grass*\n\n*Ketones* – Not as prevalent as monoterpenes and alcohol. Distinctive fragrance. Calming, sedative. Stimulates cell regeneration, increases cell growth and liquivies mucous.\n\n*High in ketones: western red cedar, rosemary, idaho tansy*\n\n*Oxides* – derived from compounds such as alcohol, terpenes, or ketones which have been oxidized. \n\n*High in oxides – Ravensara, eucaluptus*\n\n    other compounds 20% or less: Alkalines, etheres, carboxylic, acids, lactines, coumarins, furanoids.\n\nMost of these sub-groups can be broke down into specific compounds from there you can really see a total chemical profile of an EO.\n\n    ie. grapefruit profile\n    90-95% monoterpenes, 3-8% tetraterpenes, 1-3% aldehydes, >3% furanocoumarines, sesquiterpenones, alochols, thiols. Aka detoxifeir, antiseptic, antiviral due to increased monoterpenes.\n\nThanks for reading, hope this was of some interest and help. Sorry about my typos or grammatical errors, I feel too lazy to go and change them :p\n\nIf anyone has anything else to add to this, please do! \n\n[good site](http://aromaticwisdominstitute.com/are-your-essential-oils-gcms-tested)",

Also, always give that bottle a quick shake before spritzing!\n\nI discovered completely by accident that a drop of spearmint oil in a vanilla shake makes a damn fine replica of a McDonald's shamrock shake.

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/HpXdkK7lLGQ)  \n\nCold River Soapworks ([https://www.coldriversoapworks.com/](https://www.coldriversoapworks.com/)) is an artisan based out of ​Baldwinsville, NY. The company makes shaving soap, aftershave and bath soap. The company prides itself on delivery high quality shaving soap that is made in small batch format and remains free of synthetic detergents and contain no artificial preservatives. Springtime LE was released on April 6, 2018 and is not currently available due to it’s seasonal nature.  While CRSW is not among the most featured artisans in “shaves of the day” across all platforms, Cold River Soapworks has a deep following on the Shave Nook ([http://shavenook.com/showthread.php?tid=52357](http://shavenook.com/showthread.php?tid=52357)). Unless I missed something in my Google search, it appears the products are only sold direct through the company’s website.\n\n2018 Springtime LE is a complex scent featuring aromas of greens, citrus, earth, rosemary and wood. The scent is dominated by a vetiver that is complemented by smells of petrichor, zesty lemon and herbal rosemary. It feels like there is a backdrop of oakmoss that balances the entire scent out. The scent evokes the thought of spring time when the earth is damp and the vegetation begins to come out of it’s winter slumber. This scent is a casual wear based on it’s predominantly earthy and damp presentation and it is ideally suited for spring or early fall in my opinion. Scent strength is mid off the sample I have and remains mid throughout the entire shave. Scents with a similar presentiment are: Mickey Lee Soapworks Réunion and Shannon's Soaps Haymarket Vetiver.\n\nCold River Soapworks Select soap base is used for this offering. The soap base represents their animal fat soap base offering. Ingredients are listed as: Organic Beef Tallow (Pasture Raised), Stearic Acid, Organic Goat Milk, Castor Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Kokum Butter, Potassium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Apricot Kernel Oil, Fragrance, Avocado Oil, Lanolin, Kaolin Clay, Citric Acid, Sodium Lactate, Tussah Silk. The soap is on the softer side of mid and requires a normal amount of hydration to ensure proper lather consistency. When dialed in the lather will resemble crème fraîche. Surprisingly, the primary slickness of this base is just good, despite its high sheen. Residual slickness is the same and care is needed to move the blade over spots where no visible lather is present. Exactly opposite is the post shave. It is excellent and provides deep hydration to the skin long after the shave. Given my experience with the Select soap base, the ShaveScore it receives is an 86. Soap bases with similar scoring are: Eleven Shaving and Turtleship Shave Co.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Cold River Soapworks 2018 Springtime LE (PIF)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Ghost” (promotional gift)\n* Razor - Jerry Stark #461 (gift)\n* Post - Stubble Buster Coastal (purchased) ",

Bath truffles, body oils, linen sprays, everything needed for a decadent evening in.\n\n**This box will be allowed to sell out.**\n\n**What comes in this box:**\n\nYour delicious decadent delightful box will include a few items you have seen before, and a few items that only come out when it’s chilly and cold!\n\n**Shea and Cocoa Body Butter (4oz jar)**\n\nThis Body butter is a true butter blend  ultra moisturizing for the driest skin, this includes Shea butter, cocoa butter, mango butter, apricot kernel oil, orchid extract, vitamin E, and scented with ***Ambre con Vanille*** *(vanilla with the tiniest touches of citrus and coconut, heliotrope, rose, coumarone, and jasmine. On the drydown, this is amber with rich vanilla and a hint of patchouli)*\n\n**Body-ody-ody Oil (4oz bottle)**\n\nLuxuriate like the decadent, well moisturized, tropical fish that you are.

Don’t hoard these away   USE THEM!  REAL Vanilla begins to turn brown (think about real vanilla extract—what color is it?) in lots of bath and body products due to some science stuff I am not going to bore you with  . We do have access to some products that are marketed as vanilla color stabilizers, however, they only slow the browning of the vanilla, rather than stop it. To ensure you have the best experience, I recommend using any bath/soap based product, from any maker, with real actual no joke legit vanilla in it within 1-3 months of receiving.\n\n**Silky Body Spritz (4 oz bottle)**\n\nOur best selling, tried and true   Scented with the decadent and intoxicating ***Blackberry Incense*** *(blackberries, a touch of ozone, Amber, frankincense, and a light musk)*\n\n**Linen Spray (4 oz bottle)**\n\nReformulated to have a bit more throw and sticking power   Because we do not use aerosols, these do best when spritzed onto curtains, pillows, or a little piece of fabric pinned near a vent/fan. We use essential oils and fragrance oils in our blends, so **please always test in an inconspicuous spot for staining before going H.A.M. on your beautiful duvet or sofa.**\n\nScented with **Wisteria Lane** (*heavily flowering wisteria trees, intermingled with soft, almost indistinguishable rose petals, and spicy jasmine)*\n\n**Sugar Scrub (aka Body Polish) (4oz jar)**\n\nOur best selling product to date. Moisturizing and exfoliating, magically transforming, fluffy and scrubby—sugar scrubs. Polish your beautiful body to exfoliated perfection.

This collaboration partnership has really blossomed into something special in 2019. The strengths of each artisan are leveraged to spoil the wet shaving hobbyist community with the riches of their labor. Carnivale will be available this week at Maggard Razors ([www.maggardrazors.com](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and Beard & Blade Supply Co. ([https://www.beardandblade.com.au/](https://www.beardandblade.com.au/)).\n\nCarnivale is the story of festivals and celebrations that occur during the cool months of autumn. The story unfolds with gradual changing of temperature as well as vegetation. Scent notes of: Apricot, Muscatel, Plum, Amalfi Lemon, Spice, Brandy, Fig, Mahogany, Dried Apricot, Blackcurrant, Jazz Cabbage, Amber, Sandalwood, Cedarwoods, Ho Wood, Vetiver and Bourbon Vanilla make for a complex and refined fragrance. This is a warm scent of spices, fall fruits and resinous tones. Mrs. Ruds enjoys this scent for casual wear, like sitting by the firepit. Strength of scent is mid-strong from the container and for the shave’s duration. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Ariana & Evans Asian Plum as a comparable scent profile.\n\nStorybook Soapworks uses a tallow based soap featuring listed ingredients of: Stearic Acid, Water, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Fragrance, Shea Butter, Vegetable Glycerin, Rice Bran Oil, Avocado Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Sodium Lactate, Tocopherol. The soap is soft and therefore care should be taken to ensure it is not overloaded. The soap is of above average thirst, but not the thirstiest soap out there. When properly hydrated and dialed in, the resulting lather will display the consistency of sour cream. Both primary and residual slickness are very good. While short of the upper tier soaps in terms of slickness, it gets the job done without any problems. Post shave is protective and nourishing to the skin. The post shave, like the slickness is very good. Storybook Soapworks soap base is more than a serviceable base in terms of performance and as such receives a ShaveScore of 88. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest: Purely Skinful Handmade Essentials and Stubble Buster.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Australian Private Reserve/Storybook Soapworks Carnivale (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Mozingo Brushworks “Pure” (gift)\n* Razor - Razorock Echo (loaner)\n* Post - Maol Grooming Authors Ridge (promotional gift)",

Now is the time to look in your local forest for the first nettle tips!!!! I am so pumped to go gather some of this absolute pal of an herb. makes me feel like all my tissues are like firmed up from within me. cant advocate for nettles enough\n\n**hormone and liver balancing herbs** like dong quai, black cohosh, and vitex at different points in the cycle, as well as burdock and dandelion root for liver assistance in processing yucky toxic metabolic leftovers and stuff.\n\n**oil cleanser** made of 9 parts olive oil/castor oil and 1 part polysorbate 80- apply to dry skin, massage lovingly and rinse off. wash 1 or 2 times a day, but generally always before bed. cheap but organic oil is fine, the oil is just good at dissolving the oil on your skin and in your pores, it doesn't need to be fancy oil bc you're just gonna wash it off, save the fancy oil for your moisturizer. i got my cleanser recipe from a youtube channel called humblebeeandme. this shit is really super great, way better at removing blackheads and generally preventing congestion than any cleanser I've ever used.\n\n**rosewater and glycerin spray** (like 1 tsp glycerin per 8oz rosewater) after washing face\n\n**herby** **face moisturizing oil** a few drops of sesame, rosehip seed and apricot kernel oil blend infused for 2 months with st johns wort, calendula, lavender, comfrey, and willow bark. sometimes I'll add a few drops of german chamomile essential oil to it. really soothing and anti inflammatory and doesnt clog pores.\n\n**SPF 15+** also eat antioxidant rich foods!!!! repair that sun damage from both sides\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still have some flare ups under my chin here and there, and I also still use a BHA peel that I had from before every couple weeks if I'm feeling clogged up, but my skin is 90% better, less red and inflamed and less congested and softer and more quick to heal. it's really cool. I'm 27 and I finally am done going thru puberty lol",

Apologies in advance for any typos/grammatical errors; I have very poor eyesight, even with glasses.\n\n1. Young Living & DoTerra: claim to have their own farms, and while this is true (YL does have a few farms in Utah), it also shares the same supplier, which anyone who can put two and two together can figure out that this supplier most likely also supplies other essential oil companies that charge less.\n\nBio Young Aromas is the supplier for both companies, per the port shipment and data reports below.\n\nLink 1: [https://portexaminer.com/trade-data/bio-young-aromas-co-ltd-young-living-essentials-oils/banqsha5283692/](https://portexaminer.com/trade-data/bio-young-aromas-co-ltd-young-living-essentials-oils/banqsha5283692/)\n\nLink 2: [https://www.seair.co.in/us-import/i-doterra.aspx](https://www.seair.co.in/us-import/i-doterra.aspx)\n\n2) Damning evidence that Young Living and DoTerra adulterate their oils with synthetic compounds.\n\nSource (long but juicy article): [http://utahstories.com/2014/08/damning-evidence-that-young-living-and-doterras-essential-oils-are-adulterated/](http://utahstories.com/2014/08/damning-evidence-that-young-living-and-doterras-essential-oils-are-adulterated/)\n\n3) Young Living loves to post videos about the good things they do for their farmers in other countries. Here's an article about YL's bizarre drama involving Somalia: [http://utahstories.com/2014/07/young-living-farms-wacky-somalian-adventures/](http://utahstories.com/2014/07/young-living-farms-wacky-somalian-adventures/)\n\nThe following stories are anecdotal; no citations but hey, since you've made it this far...\n\n1. Perfectly Posh claims that its hand creams contain coconut oil, apricot kernel oil, and cetearyl alcohol (this is a fatty acid which is actually hydrating; it's just unfortunate that it's called an \"alcohol\" in the scientific community), which are placed fairly high on their ingredients lists, and should be hydrating. However, the quality & performance of the products do not match what is claimed on their labels. I have been making my own soaps and lotions from scratch (as a hobbyist, not to sell) for 20 years, and just by touch alone, I could tell that the ingredients were mainly cheap waxes and perfumes. The performance does not match the claims. *The goal of MLMs is never about the products; the goal is to build your own pyramid.*\n2. Arbonne's makeup is terrible, and all Arbonne huns know this. The reason why prices for MLM products are so high is because *selling is never the goal, recruiting is*. One Arbonne hun threw a party, but she knew how bad the makeup quality was, so she paid for a professional makeup artist to come because professional artists tend to be able to make even bad quality makeup look good/good enough. This artist told me after that these were the worst makeup she had ever worked with, and could not in good conscience recommend them to anybody. She said that they were greasy, waxy, patchy, and were so awful that she took longer than she should have just to blend them alone. The prices are comparable to Chanel's, except that Chanel makeup is actually very nice, albeit pricey (but nice).\n\nEdit to add: confluence of Mormonism, MLMs, and essential oils --\n\n1.

    "body": "\nI know aromatherapy and essential oils are becoming more popular, and you are finding them for sale a lot more readily available. I thought I'd give some information to everyone on how to properly buy or identify a good grade essential oil. I've supplied a lot of information =] hope some of it makes some sense.\n\nI have this similar post, not as detailed in some other subreddits, but someone suggested I post it again here, so here it is! With more to wrap your brain around.\n\nJust for the record, I am not a certified aromatherapist. The course is ridiculously expensive.. maybe one day. But I am a firm believer in the use of essential oils as well as herbalism. If anyone has any questions on either, I can try my best to help answer with what I know. Or if someone else here is certified aromatherapist or herbalist it would be great to hear from you :) I have many questions!\n\nI am supplying the information I received from aromatherapy courses, as well as some of my own research since then. So please, do not hold any of my methods, blends ideas accountable for anything. Everything is at your own risk. You should always consult a certified aromatherapist if you are looking to use EO for medicinal use. They can be very dangerous if you don't know the specificity for each oil. There are some oils that cannot be used with pregnant ladies, certain diseases/conditions. Skin sensitivities can be a hazard as well.\n\nIf you are planning to use essential oils on your own, just remember **Always use smaller concentrations with animals and children! Always dilute your oils, unless specified by a certified aromatherapist**\n\nFirst I want to start by saying, I live in Canada.. so we are a part of the Canadian Federation of Aromatherapy (CFA)\n\nThere are many factors that can determine whether or not you are getting legit good grade essential oils. Once you read through this post, it should be clear as to why some oils can be so expensive. Fun fact: It takes about 60000 roses to produce just 1 ounce of rose oil :)\n\n**3 models of aromatherapy** \n\n**-** German emphasizes inhalation of EO\n\n**-** British is very conservative, support high level dilution, no emphasis on therapeutic grade oils\n\n**-** French proactive and support NEAT (direct skin use). Rely strongly on scientific studies, emphasizes therapeutic uses.\n\n**3 Factors to grow the best crop** – Take into consideration for purchasing essential oils (EO)\n\n**-** grown with no pollution.\n\n**-** Harvested properly. Only oil pockets should be harvested not the whole plant.\n\n**-** Harvested when yield is highest.\n\n**Facts about Essential oils you may not know:**\n\n - A bottle of EO only needs 3-5% of actually essential oil to be labeled 'pure' which is why its important to research the brands quality.\n\nOil pockets are specific to each plant they are found in. A plant grown one place will be different to another.\n\n** Extraction methods**\n\nCO2 extracted – not for medicinal use\n\nSteam extracted – is the best. You should only purchase and use this.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAllergic reactions to scents usually come from synthesized material used in place of oil. \n\nAll plants have their own antidotes, there’s no allergens to pure oil. \n\nSandalwood tree grows 50 years before it can be harvested. Forest fires have limited the production of this EO.\n\n*It's always nice to incorporate a drop of a persons 'essence' into their blend. Eg; a showy person, likes attention – they may like cinnamon. A down to earth person – Thyme.*\n\n\n****Quality control***\n\n*What to look for and ask to see when buying oils. If the seller doesn’t have the information, or isn't sure what you mean...* **DO NOT BUY!**\n\n**Botanical name** – normally on the front of the bottle ie. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) Always *Always* Make sure to check the botanical name, there are sometimes mulitple types of one plant and they can be VERY different, for instance, the regular lavendar you know is called lavendar officinalis, but there is also a Lavendar lespica.. it smells different and is used for a stimulant (complete opposites!)\n\n**Geographical location** – where the plant was harvested from\n\n**Plant harvest** – Wild is best. It has natural fighting instincts, making its biochemical make up stronger. \n\n**Stage of development** – if the plant was at its highest peak when harvested\n\n**Distilled organ** – not usually worried about in North America\n\n**Mode of extraction** – You always want steam distilled\n\n**Biochemical specificity** - Designation of biochemical specificity is critical in knowing what unique characteristics are available for therapeutic uses and specific purposes. For example, there are several forms of essential oil of Thyme, each having its own therapeutic benefits and uses. Knowing the distinctions can keep you and your family safe, and benefiting from the wisdom of the ages. [site explaining gas chromatography and steam distillation](http://www.frre.utn.edu.ar/quimobi/clean/files/get/item/1870)\n \n\nThis may seem tricky to begin with, but look these things up online and you will learn better, or take a weekend aromatherapy course :)\n\n**Modes of use**\n\n*topical* – most common\nfor Massage, compresses, hand/foot bath, regular bath. If you are using oils in a path, place your salts/oils/oats ect in cheesecloth to hold everything together. \n\n    Always dilute with skin sensitivities.\n\n    Don't use petroleum based oils, mineral oils, or baby oil they decrease the absorption on skin.\n\n    Essential oils don't mix well with water, they need a medium. Vodka or witch hazel work good, as does any sort of oil – olive, apricot, sweet almond ect.\n\n    Always mix your oils in glass, it can eat through plastic. Once it is mixed with a medium it is alright for plastic containers.\n\n**Aerosols** – affect the limbic system\n**Always use a GLASS diffuser**\n\n    Oil goes through the glass and adamises through the air.\n\n    Heating oils – heat kills the biochems therefore leaving no therapeutic effect, but smells nice\n\n    using pads – all the biochemicals evaporate, leaving only a nice scent.\n\n    Plastic – oils eat through plastic. Not a good idea\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, diluted EO's don't eat plastic, so blends in blastic are ok!\n\n**Cooking** – helps increase flavour, add it right before serving, don't cook the EO. And you only need a drop or two in each personal serving. A little goes a long way.\n\n    Try these – 1 drop of basil on a bowl of chili\n\n    mix 1 drop of ginger in with sugar for sprinkling on gingersnaps\n    \n    peppermint EO in icing for cakes, cookies ect.\n    \n    Peppermint or sweet orange in a cup of hot chocolate. \n\n**Gardening**  \n\nYou can line a garden bed (or plant pots) with a string soaked in a diluted citrus essential oil. \nI don't have much experience with this area, but certain EO's can keep birds away from berries, pests away from trees.. :) you can also use certain EO's on pets to keep ticks away, thyme is one of them! \n\n\n    A nice carpet cleaner/pwder I use before vaccuming – 1 cup of baking soda, 20 drops total of (top)sweet orange, (mid)bergamot, (base) eucalyptus. Sprinkle it all around and let it sit for up to an hour, its safe to walk on I sometimes move it around with my feet. Then vacuum it up! Sometimes I sprinkle EO into my vacuum bag too for a nice scent. \n\n    Floor washing – 1/2c vinegar, with a mixture of orange, grapefruit, eucalyptus\n\n\n*Fragrance notes are based on volatility and viscosity.* This is what gives you Top Mid and Base notes. Lighter oils are top notes meaning they will disappear quicker you add moire of this, where base notes stay and linger, you need less of this one. [site with good information on fragrance notes and much more](http://www.essentialoils.co.za/fragrance-notes.htm#Holistic%20and%20alternative%20medicine)\n\nTop notes: evaporate quickest, increase the # of drops, most stimulating\n\nMid notes: Balancer, increase concentration\n\nBase notes: Smell last, is strongest, dont use a lot, sedative/fixative in the blend.\n\n    A good ratio to use Top4 Mid3 Base1, and apply that to your carrier\n    More ratios If you're wanting something from an acute problem use 10 drops, ratio 1 top 2 mid.\n*Chronic: 7 drops total 2 mid 1 base*\n*Synergistic: 8 drops 1 top 1 mid*\n\n**Here is a Blending guide:**\n\nFor **normal dilution - which is 2.5%**\n\nx amount of carrier oil - divide by 2 = drops of essential oil\nfor example: 20ml carrier oil / 2 = 10 drops.\n\nExample of a 2.5% blend - 5 sandalwood, 3 lavendar, 2 orange in 20ml apricot kernel oil.\n\n**Low dilution 1% for sensitive skin and pregnancy** (always check with a certified aromatherapist or someone of alternative medicine before using when pregnant, for children or babies)\n\nX amount carrier oil in ml - divide by 4 = essential oil drops\n\n**Extremely low dilution, sensitive skin, children, babies**\n1 drop : 10 ml Or use sweet almond oil by itself.\n\n**Some nice blends:**\n\nClary sage + ylangylang – calming\n\nLemon grass – 10 drops in a hotel(or house) tub to help \ncleans air, make it really hot so the room steams up.\n\nGrapefruit – brings joy helps with releasing grief\n\nThyme – gets rid of ticks\n\nLemon – cleansing. Good to diffuse in the air when cleaning, or use in household cleansers\n\nBasil + lavender – helps with insomnia\n\ngeranium – increases ambiance, brings conversation to a party when diffused in air.\n\nClarysage – helps with painful periods, dysmenorrhea\n\nThyme, lineol, honey – good for coughs\n\nnettle herb and rosemary – gives hair a nice effect\n\nwintergreen, lemongrass – good for arthritis relief\n\npatchouli – great for skin in general\n\nvitivere + grapefruit – I just really like this one lol\n\ncitronella, peppermint, lemongrass – repel bugs/ants\n\n\nconsiderations when blending: [Carrier oil info and shelf lives](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html)\n\n**oil chemistry:** volatility, viscolsity and properties.\n\nDesired therapeutic action – blending correctly allows synergistic affect in the blend (action of oils increase by mixing together)\n\nsequence of blend – changing the sequence of blending can chance the bichem properties and smell\n\nBase oils: It's nice to use a mixture of different base oils here's some general information about some different oils, this info is easy to find anywhere on the internet though.\n\n    *All purpose oils – used for cosmetics, massage, fragrant baths. Oils listed below:*\n\nApricot kernel – high mineral and vitamins, natural moisturizer. Light texture, increases penetrative qualities.\n\nSunflower – Fine. Good for massage blends, high in vitamin E\n\nSweet almond – Soothing, softening properites. Good for babies.\n\nGrapeseed – Good for oily skin.\n\n    *Special carrier oils: help increase skin penetration, nourish dry dehydrated skin, increase a lifespan of oil blends.* \n\nCarrot oil – lots of vitamins, A especailly.. helps with tanning careful it can stain.\n\nSesame – 85% unsaturated 15% saturated fat. Used as additive to enrich other oils.\n\nAvocado – lots of vit A, B, lecithin, protiens, fats, gives soft skin, absorbs easy.\n\nJojoba – long shelf life, thicken reams, resembles skins natural sebum. Suitable for face.\n\nWheatgerm – rich and viscous. Strong smell. Use 10-20% ratio to other oils to prevent rancidity.\n\n\n**Chemistry** [site reference](http://www.experience-essential-oils.com/chemistry-of-essential-oil.html)\n\nThis may be a bit in depth. But its useful information if you wanna get more serious about your oils!\n\nTherapeutic oil has no propylene glycol or petrochemicals\n\nmain groups of compounds in EO's are hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds which are further divided...\n\n*monoterpenes:* – inhibit accumulation of toxins, detox kidneys, liver. Enhance therapeutic values of other compounds, balancing.\n\n*High in monoterpenes: Grapefruit, orange, baloomfir*\n\n*Phenolics* – stimulate the nervous system and immune system. Clean receptor sites for cells so faulty information can be deleted from the cell. Antioxidants, increase oxygenating molecules, anti-infectious, anti-bacterial, antiseptic\n\n*High in phenolic – wintergreen, clove, teatree*\n\n*Alcohols* – increase resistance to oxidation. Ability to revert cells to their normal function, anti infectious/viral/bacteraial.\n\n*high in alcohols: rosewood, geranium, rose otto*\n\n*Esters* – reaction of alcohol and acid. Most relaxing, calming, balancing. Regulate the nervous sytem. Anti-fungal decrease inflamation and spasm.\n\n*High in esters: bergamot, valerian, roman chammomile*\n\n* Aldehydes* – Delightful fragrances. Antiviral, inflammation, calms nervous system, helps decrease blood pressure, relieves stress.\n\n*High in aldehydes: cinnamon bark, lemon grass*\n\n*Ketones* – Not as prevalent as monoterpenes and alcohol. Distinctive fragrance. Calming, sedative. Stimulates cell regeneration, increases cell growth and liquivies mucous.\n\n*High in ketones: western red cedar, rosemary, idaho tansy*\n\n*Oxides* – derived from compounds such as alcohol, terpenes, or ketones which have been oxidized. \n\n*High in oxides – Ravensara, eucaluptus*\n\n    other compounds 20% or less: Alkalines, etheres, carboxylic, acids, lactines, coumarins, furanoids.\n\nMost of these sub-groups can be broke down into specific compounds from there you can really see a total chemical profile of an EO.\n\n    ie. grapefruit profile\n    90-95% monoterpenes, 3-8% tetraterpenes, 1-3% aldehydes, >3% furanocoumarines, sesquiterpenones, alochols, thiols. Aka detoxifeir, antiseptic, antiviral due to increased monoterpenes.\n\nThanks for reading, hope this was of some interest and help. Sorry about my typos or grammatical errors, I feel too lazy to go and change them :p\n\nIf anyone has anything else to add to this, please do! \n\n[good site](http://aromaticwisdominstitute.com/are-your-essential-oils-gcms-tested)",

Collaborative efforts such as this have become more common with AP Reserve of late. AP Reserve leverages their mastery of fragrance, while utilizing various U.S. based artisan’s soap base. Available in soap, aftershave splash and EdT, this offering can be found direct from the artisans websites or at Maggard Razors.\n\nFresca Intensa is a Colonia type fragrance, known for their masculine yet sophisticated use of citrus. This invigorating blend features notes of: Cedrat, Neroli, Lemon Verbena, Lime, Lemon, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Lavender, Rhubarb, Petitgrain, Sweet Orange, Bergamot, Rosemary, Rose, Amber, White Musk, Ambergris and Vetiver. This is a bright, crisp scent that screams summer seasonal. Mrs. Ruds approves of this scent for casual use, however she does not find it sexy enough for date night. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the container and moves to strong as you build lather. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Catie’s Bubbles Confiant as a comparable scent profile.    \n\nStorybook Soapworks uses a tallow based soap featuring listed ingredients of: Stearic Acid, Water, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Fragrance, Shea Butter, Vegetable Glycerin, Rice Bran Oil, Avocado Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Sodium Lactate, Tocopherol. The soap is soft and therefore care should be taken to ensure it is not overloaded. The soap is of above average thirst, but not the thirstiest soap out there. When properly hydrated and dialed in, the resulting lather will display the consistency of sour cream. Both primary and residual slickness are very good. While short of the upper tier soaps in terms of slickness, it gets the job done without any problems. Post shave is protective and nourishing to the skin. The post shave, like the slickness is very good. Storybook Soapworks soap base is more than a serviceable base in terms of performance and as such receives a ShaveScore of 88. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest: Purely Skinful Handmade Essentials and Stubble Buster.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Australian Private Reserve/Storybook Soapworks Fresca Intensa (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Simpsons Chubby 2 “Super Badger” (gift)\n* Razor - Colonial Silversmith (gift)\n* Post - Australian Private Reserve/Storybook Soapworks Fresca Intensa (promotional gift)",

The owner, Russel, is a farmer/cattle rancher by day and a soap maker by night. He prides himself on selling a quality product and relies solely on word of mouth to get the word out about the company and his products. He is open minded and wants to hear from users on how to continue to make product and brand improvements. I urge you to check out the company’s robust rewards program for returning customers ([http://www.wildwestshavingco.com/return-customer-rewards/](http://www.wildwestshavingco.com/return-customer-rewards/)), it is one of the best values I have seen in wet shaving. Soaps, aftershaves, colognes and razor services can all be purchased direct from their website.\n\nWyatt Earp is a complex blend featuring notes of: Caramel, Coffee, Patchouli, Vanilla, Honey, Milk, Tonka, Lavender, Mint, Amber, Coriander, Cedar, Musk and Jasmine. The scent opens sweet from the caramel, honey and vanilla before being balanced out by the smoky cedar and, resinous amber and dark musk. This is a very masculine blend that is deeply complex but not offensive at all. I envision this as a multipurpose wear and would also consider it multi-seasonal. Scent strength is mid-strong off the puck and remains mid-strong once lathered. Scents with a similar vibe from the wet shaving space are: Ginger's Garden Enigma and Cooper & French Fair Isle Harbor.\n\nWild West Shaving Co. uses  a tallow based soap that features the following ingredients: Stearic Acid, Tallow, Water, Glycerin, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Bentonite Clay, Mango Seed Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Sodium Borate. The soap base is mid-firm on the firmness spectrum. The soap enjoys a standard amount of water as compared to mainstream tallow soap bases. Once dialed in and agitated properly, the lather will resemble cool whip. The slickness of this soap base is good in terms of both primary slickness and secondary slickness. The post shave is very good and allows the user to forgo any post shave product without fear of drying out their skin. Given my experience with this soap base, the ShaveScore for Wild West Shaving Co. is an 84. For similar performance I can suggest First Canadian Shave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Wild West Shaving Co.

After removing it, the numbness slowly faded, to be back to my normal sensations about 15mins later. I didn't see any swelling.\n\nI'm confused because this type of reaction never happened to me before, I have no issues with my other lip glosses (at worst, I felt a slight tingling with the Fenty gloss bomb, and stopped using it). Plus the brand insists on their products being hypoallergenic, suited for sensitive skin, so I wasn't worried about allergens. I'm surprised at how intense my reaction was (and I'm on antihistamines, this is bizarre but I can't find another explanation than an allergy). I patch tested it on my had and in my elbow crease, nothing happened.\n\nI looked up what could cause lip numbness but haven't found anything of note that could explain why the gloss did this. I compared Tower 28's formula composition to all the other glosses I've tried and had no issues with (Clarins, Roen, Pat McGrath, Lisa Eldridge, Too Faced, Urban Decay), and all I could identify as being different were the vegetal oils (apricot kernel oil, rice bran extract, rosemary leaf extract, rosa canina fruit oil, raspberry seed oil).\n\nHas anyone had experienced a similar reaction, or have any insight on this ?

I find myself really taking my time to massage the product in and enjoy the slightly fruity scent. This balm breaks through sunscreen (I am not a makeup wearer) very well. \n\nUpon rinsing though, I noticed that this product does take a bit more work to completely remove. This is especially true around the eye area or anywhere there was a heavier layer of product. \n\nIt still emulsifies like other cleansing balms...it just takes a bit more work than I am used to.\n\nBut once it is rinsed the Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm leaves behind a wonderfully soft yet thoroughly cleansed feel to the skin. I’ve also noticed some mild smoothing and texture balancing over time that I don't think I can say any other first step cleanser has provided.\n\nBecause of the lack of synthetic fragrance, PEG (in their most commonly known forms), and essential oils...I can see why this product has been an instant hot item. It plays into everything today’s skincare area is focusing on.\n\nI really think the issues I had with rinsing/removing could have been avoided had Glow Recipe left in some of the more common emulsifying ingredients. That is 100% personal preference, I know you may feel different, which is why I still think this is an excellent product for some.\n\nWhen it comes to an effective cleansing balm that rinses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling soft, non-irritated, and generally looking awesome...the crown still goes to the Then I Met You Living Cleansing Balm.\n\nI adore that product for its lovely/creamy/buttery texture, smooth application, and wonderful scent. Nothing else I have used has quite met the same bar (although several have come really close).\n\nThe Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm is a masterclass in taking what consumers are asking for...and creating something really special and results driven. While I do like nearly everything about it, the Living Cleansing Balm is still where my heart (and my wallet) remain.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Sorbitan Oleate, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Polyethylene, Aqua/Water/Eau, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Papain, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Alkanna Tinctoria Root Extract, Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Levulinic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Metabisulfite\n\nWhere To Buy (Glow Recipe Site $32.00 USD): [https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm](https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjq6r33zufi51.jpg?width=5216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=017f1ce44e4b47be5af362fd00fbd51cecf0c57d",

    "body": " About 2+ weeks ago I posted about trialling some topical melatonin products.  I'm posting my experience to date:\n\nUPDATE: I ordered the Topical Faded serum, a Melatonin Cream made by Supplement Spot, and SkinActives UV Repair cream. All contain varying amounts of melatonin, w/I think the Melatonin Cream containing the most. I would have tried the Gold Bond cream, but it contained coconut oil, which is a disaster on my face. I was going to try the LifeExtension Cosmesis Melatonin Peptide cream, which looked pretty good, but I went w/ the Supplement Spot brand because it was cheaper (at least on Amazon). I've now used all 3 at varying times (sometimes only 1 product, sometimes all 3, yeah that's crazy but oh well) for about 2 weeks now.\n\nThe Faded serum was a pale yellow creamy substance. Smelled like sulfur, but was otherwise nice, but I felt like it was lightening my skin all over instead of just my dark spots, so I felt like what's the point? The dark spots are still darker than the non-spot areas. Also, it did irritate me slightly. No clogging or breakouts though. A nice product, but I felt like it wasn't really helping my issue. To be fair, I didn't use it long enough to really know if it would work longterm. I may come back to it later.\n\nThe Melatonin Cream was unexpectedly very good. A pale beige cream in a tub, and I hate tubs - I prefer a squeeze tube. But there was no strong fragrance, only a very very faint slightly lavender/tea tree type smell. Interesting because there is no fragrance on the ing list and I didn't see any ing that might smell like this. Also the label says fragrance free. No irritation or redness whatsoever, my skin looked plumped, softened, and SUPER CALM when using this. It's a light cream and sinks in almost immediately, leaving no greasy shine or tacky residue. I have acne and rosacea, w/ both redness and pustules, and oily/combo skin that is super finicky and clog prone, so it's really hard for me to find a moisturizer that works but doesn't break me out or turn me red. This stuff had a fairly short and simple ing list, the first 4 ings being water, safflower seed oil, aloe vera gel, and Sepigel 305. It also had some other plant oils - hemp seed oil, evening primrose oil, apricot kernel oil, and grapeseed oil. Melatonin was the 5th ing. I was shocked this stuff worked so well, because usually my skin hates most oils. BUt my skin looked super plumped and calm. My skin tone even looked more even - maybe just because it was very well moisturized and calmed. Any spots (sebaceous hyperplasia and rosacea pustules) I had looked smaller and less irritated. No clogging. NO breakouts. This cream is marketed for promoting restful sleep, not for anything else. I used it at night at first, but liked it so much I am using it during the day. Have not noticed getting sleepy except one day when I slathered it pretty much everywhere - face, body, in the AM. Overall, awesome moisturizer, that i feel can be used AM and PM, as long as you don't use all over in the AM, and very calming and moisturizing w/o clogging or greasiness/oiliness.\n\nSkinActives UV Repair cream is a light golden brown cream in a small tub, again, not a fan of tubs. Had a fair amt of darker brown flecks and particles. Vaguely sulfury smell as well. Emailed the company, asking if the particles were normal. Answer was yes. So I tried it. It does leave a film or residue, plus visible particles, and tends to pill under makeup, so it's not really feasible for me to use this in the AM. NOt as moisturizing as the Supplement Spot Melatonin cream, but this is marketed as a UV Repair cream, so OK. Skin did not feel as calmed or plumped as w/ the Melatonin Cream, and not as calming. I think this may be a tx cream where longer term use is needed to judge its effectiveness.\n\nOverall, I am extremely impressed by at least one melatonin product in this line up and am interested in trying more melatonin products. Maybe I'll try the LifeExtension Cosmesis one next, but the Supplement Spot one is a keeper.",

A brief explanation of my PM routine (as I use the facial oil at night only):  \nDouble Cleanse (Cleansing Balm + Water Based Cleanser) + Toner + Moisturiser + Facial Oil + Under Eye + Lip Balm \n* ***Your age -*** 25\n* ***Usage timeline -*** May 2020 to October 2020, so six months!\n* ***Ingredient List -*** (taken from their website) Argan oil, Jojoba oil, Apricot kernel oil, Vitamin-E oil, Sweet almond oil, Rose-hip oil, Ylang Ylang essential oil, Lavender essential oil, Frankincense essential oil, Geranium essential oil, Rosemary essential oil. \n* ***Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status*** ***-*** Holy Grail!  \n\n\n***My comments -***\n\nThis is my first time using a facial oil, and I'm glad it turned out to be a great experience.  Their website lists these as the benefits: \n\n* Moisturizes your skin extensively and adds extra nourishment.\n* Gives a natural healthy glow.\n* Protects skin from harmful pollutants.\n* Rejuvenates and minimizes fine lines.\n\nand I will 100% say my face definitely feels more hydrated and has a glow!!! The oil does have a fragrance but I am someone who doesn't mind fragrance in products so it wasn't an issue for me. The consistency is a bit thick (how oils are usually), and just a few drops is usually enough for my face. It's not a dry oil.\n\n*Another note* \\- When this oil was 99% over I read some info (which wasn't satisfying tbvh) about how lavender EO in products is not good for your skin in the long term, etc etc. I panicked and purchased another oil, unfortunately :( Right after that, in a Q&A done by the brand on Instagram, I asked them about this and they too answered me as well. Which is when I was doubting my previous half-baked opinion. And recently in a [discussion on the weekly thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/jhdytl/weekly_routine_help_thread_have_a_question_ask/gaklxqq/?context=3) /u/wildchopstiks pointed out how if there's no reaction I should continue using the product. After some thinking, I decided this was right and will definitely be repurchasing it soon!!!\n\nSo.. that's about it. I LOVE this oil. A LOT. In case that wasn't clear already haha.",

    "body": "[Video Up](https://youtu.be/cxoBES70keQ)  \n\n---\n\nEleven Shaving (https://elevenshaving.com/) is the rebranded Sapone Di Palo. The artisan recently overhauled the entire branding, packaging, soap base and aftershave base. These improvements have been getting a lot of positive feedback from the wet shaving community and early reviews of the new soap base point to major improvements over previous iterations. The artisan offers shaving soap, aftershave splash as well as aftershave balm. The name Eleven refers to Lock and Dam no. 11 located in Dubuque, Iowa where the artisan grew up. In addition to direct purchase, Eleven Shaving offerings are available at Maggard Razors (https://www.maggardrazors.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nLime & Basil is simply stated a lime forward scent with a hint of basil. Using Mexican lime, which is very bright and crisp with just the right amount of basil to add some herbaceousness to this accord, the scent becomes ideal for warm weather use. This scent is perfect for those that enjoy citrus forward scents and for those that enjoy what I call, “smile” scents. It is so bright and refreshing that it just puts a smile on your face. Scent strength on Lime & Basil is mid-strong off the sample and remains this way through the lathering and shaving experiences. Similar scents to this are Stirling Soap Co. Lime and Mike’s Natural Lime.\n\nEleven Shaving has overhauled their soap base, coincidently, the offering is base number eleven in the iteration. The new ingredients list features tallow and is listed as: Stearic Acid, Water, Tallow, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Mango Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Sodium Lactate, Allantoin, Vitamin E, Hydrolyzed Silk. This soap is of medium firmness and has no issues loading into your brush fiber of choice. The soap is not overly thirsty and whips into a lather very routinely. When dialed in, the lather resembles whipped cream. The slickness on this new base is good, both primary slickness and residual slickness. The post shave is good as well. Because of the addition of vitamins and skin food, the post shave feeling is quite luxurious on the skin. This is a well rounded soap base with nothing lacking. The shavescore for Eleven Shaving’s soap base is an 89. This classes it with other solid offerings like Mickey Lee Soapworks and Chiseled Face Groomatorium.  \n\n---\n**Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Eleven Shaving Lime & Basil (free sample)\n\n* Brush - ​Maseto Shaving 30mm 2 band (purchased)\n\n* Razor - Wade & Butcher “Clear” (gift)\n​\n* Post - Stubble Buster Coastal (purchased)\f\n",

    "body": "I will be blind-reviewing these without the notes, but I’ve definitely seen the notes before hah so hopefully a milder influence.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n**HOTEL CLANDESTINE** \n\n*Bottle sniff*: Vague, soft and almost oceanic but with an herbal bite. If you like garden perfumes you'll like this. \n\n*On the skin*: Funny that it’s almost shocking that the Hotel Clandestine scent is pretty much EXACTLY the same in the lotion as in the perfume. Either way it starts off quite juicy but fresh and cilantro-basil-y and definitely gives that distinctive hotel scent memory, like “oooh I snatched these mini bottles from a hotel once and I won’t be back there forever but this reminds me of being on that vacation!” The juiciness has a lot to do with grapefruit but there is for sure a non-citrus fruit in there. \n\n*Dry down*: sweetens up even more! Very wearable with the red fruit making its mark. (It’s currant!)\n\n*Scent description*: It’s my own version of spa-fresh invigorating, with highlights of ruby red grapefruit and currant and bright garden herbs, with just enough can’t-put-my-finger on it dark nostalgia to make it DarlingClandestine.\n\n*B&B Textures*: The lotion does not have a ton of slip but sinks in beautifully. My poor arms are so dry all the time but this really helps, they are smooth and not lizardy. It doesn’t just temporarily soften and then float away. The conditioner is better on slip and softens my hair like WHOA I’m really impressed actually. I put a little bit on dry hair ends to test like a leave-in, I would imagine it’s equally good in the shower.\n\n*Ingredients*: Lotion: Organic aloe barbadensis leaf juice, organic castor oil, organic olive oil, organic jojoba oil, Ecocert-approved glyceryl stearate, Ecocert-approved cetearyl alcohol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, organic glycerin, palm stearic acid, allantoin, hydrolyzed oat protein, zinc oxide, kaolin clay, vitamin E acetate, prunella vulgaris (heal-all) extract, rosemary seed extract, silver citrate, leuconostoc (gram-positive bacteria-derived preservative), propanediol (naturally derived preservative), ethylhexyl glycerin (naturally derived preservative), and potassium sorbate (food grade preservative).\n\nConditioner: Organic aloe barbadensis leaf juice, organic babassu oil, behentrimonium methosulfate, cetearyl alcohol, organic extra virgin olive oil, organic apricot kernel oil, organic glycerin, silk amino acids, hydrolyzed oat protein, chamomile extract, glyceryl stearate, sodium stearoyl lactylate, panthenol DL, Vitamin E acetate, rosemary seed extract, vitamin C, vitamin B3, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, propanediol (naturally derived preservative), ethylexyl glycerin (naturally derived preservative), potassium sorbate (food grade preservative).\n\n---------------------\n\n**DULCINEA**\n\nI have mentioned before here - it’s so yummy. Slather city! \n\n*Bottle sniff*: Delicious chocolate and coffee: a realistic mocha sitting in front of you before you take the first sip. \n\n*Wet on skin*: A hit of leather and red wine that give way to sweetness, but not a toothache. Medium sugar. Well balanced diet. ;) I grew up eating sugar-covered tamarind candies so when an edge of that sweetness and a mango plushness come in, it really does it for me. BUT THE COFFEE. Rich and so so real poured over one of the nice deep dry chocolates Evonne does. This is the most killer, genuine coffee note I’ve ever experienced, like I stuck my nose right in the grounds. \n\n*Dry down*: A soft leather and chile and splash of red wine linger, but a cozy spiced mocha is still present too. I’m in heaven <3 \n\n*Scent description*: A hotter and juicier version of the sugar-skull favorite. YEARS ago some of you had occasion to try the heady cordial cherry-frosted calavera brew that was Dulcinea, splashed with red wine and dark chocolate and roasted coffee and leather. THIS version, instead of cherry, has twists of mango and tamarind dusted with chile.\n\n-------------------------\n\n**FIRE EATER**\n\nI am not sure how Evonne has got “gasoline and fizzy grapes” to smell like something alluring to me but there you go. \n\n*Bottle sniff*: has a nice hit of chiles, not in a burning way but just what chile pepper candies smell like. \n\n*Wet on skin*: Two sides keep morphing around each other! The peppers and the gas puddle grapes. Actually, not knowing the notes would probably help here as I really can’t explain that gasoline being completely non-offensive yet still giving me the impression of gasoline. More like natural gas or ozone gas I suppose? The sweetness imparted by the grape (and maybe a bit of tamarind) make it surprisingly wearable. I imagine this is literally the sweet breath of a fire eater at the carnival right before the first flame. \n\nHe’s had some candy and grapes before though - it dries down to those hot candies.\n\n*Scent description*: Odd, hot and spicy. The kind of fragrance you might dig if you’re a fan of the smell of burning leaves and gasoline puddles. Not that it smells like those things specifically, but that’s the sort of sensibility Fire Eater might jive with. The very first DC scent.  A “culmination blend” edition that merges the finer points of the odd, hot, gasoline-flare original and the “fizzy grape” edition from two years ago. \n\n-------------------------------\n\n**DEWLAP VALENTINE**\n\nI have been lusting after this for years, I literally used to have a list of DC perfumes before my time that I simply HAD to try and now it is finally complete! (Still some I haven’t tried.. there’s a second list lol). \n\n*Bottle sniff*: deep creeping leafy greens, ridged reptile skin, small round juicy strawberries on the vine. \n\n*Wet on skin*: The surprisingly warm, cozy but definitely reptilian musk begins to dominate, but the vein of sweet strawberry makes this into something I would wear all the time. I don’t even like strawberry perfumes haha, I generally avoid this note but there’s that DC magic! Apparently I can take some girly fruit when paired with the right things ;) \n\n*Dry down*: Back to DC magic again - don’t people say fruit is a hard note to keep around? Well it dries down to a musky strawberry with a wriggle of reptile and brush of green leaves.\n\n*Scent description*: A tribute to @hersplendidplumage’s iguana friends, Bob and Eepa. The original was bursting with strawberries and greens and an undercurrent of “reptile.” This year’s version dials back the strawberry and cranks up the reptile. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nA lovely throwback collection from Darling Clandestine! Also she threw in some sugar skull erasers which is cool. And a bunch of candy! Including chewy tamarind ones :) Different from the ones of my youth visiting Jamaica but still good.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/0ZUi9\n\nsorry, I ate them all. Yall know what starbursts look like!",

    "body": "This is my first non-comment post here. I have read the rules, but it’s possible that I’ve slipped up somewhere, so please inform me if I have. I’ve been doing video reviews for around 2 months and short write ups for close to a year. There is much room for improvement...\n\nCompany: Viking Soap & Cosmetic as created and run by artisan Andrew Hoiberg\n\nProduct: Citron Shaving Soap (Tallow)\n\nFYI, this is not a first impressions review. I made a video review of this soap with a fairly severe bout of seasonal allergies, so I was unable to smell anything. However, I have had Viking’s Citron for about a year, having bought it directly from Viking Soap & Cosmetic’s website, and have used it a number of times with great results. My memory of the scent is clear-I know it well and can easily describe it. On the other hand, it turns out my memory was a tad hazy on other aspects of performance, notably slickness and residual slickness. The review is as follows-The soap lathers easily and takes it’s fair share of water well. The slickness is above average and the coverage and lather density are top notch. I found the residual slickness to be nothing special and it was very average. This was a little surprising to me given the number of quality ingredient composing this soap base (tallow, stearic acid, water, potassium hydroxide, coconut oil, aloe vera juice, glycerin, castor oil, sweet almond oil, sodium hydroxide, sodium lactate, mango butter, apricot kernel oil, shea butter, fragrance, hydrolized oats, lanolin, menthol). There are soaps out there that use a long list of ingredients that are top notch, the prime example being Barrister & Mann’s glissant base. Then again, there are still others with a far shorter and simpler looking ingredients list that perform to elite or near elite levels, such as Catie’s Bubbles luxury soap base (stearic acid, water, coconut oil, potassium hydroxide, shea butter, fragrance, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, sodium lactate, glycerin). My point is that the number of ingredients does not necessarily mean a soap base is going to be amazing. Many are just as good or better with simply tallow, coconut oil, glycerin, and stearic acid. It just depends on the maker, the process and conditions used in making the soap, and the formula. After that tangent, time to get back to Citron...\nThe shea and mango butters in the soap make for a good post shave experience...good, but not elite. The scent on this is a lemon heavy citronella type of scent. It has in the last year since I purchased it to have been modified to include more grapefruit notes. The menthol is not heavy and is not very present in the scent. It’s a great citrus summer soap with a scent that is not overpowering. The soap costs around $12 for 5.5 oz of soap and is an excellent value. The labels are ok and distinctive, but need some polish, particularly the wall labels, which look very amateurish. All in all, a good brand at a great price that with some slight modifications to formula, and an improvement on marketing and presentation, could see more success in a crowded market.

I find myself really taking my time to massage the product in and enjoy the slightly fruity scent. This balm breaks through sunscreen (I am not a makeup wearer) very well. \n\nUpon rinsing though, I noticed that this product does take a bit more work to completely remove. This is especially true around the eye area or anywhere there was a heavier layer of product. \n\nIt still emulsifies like other cleansing balms...it just takes a bit more work than I am used to.\n\nBut once it is rinsed the Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm leaves behind a wonderfully soft yet thoroughly cleansed feel to the skin. I’ve also noticed some mild smoothing and texture balancing over time that I don't think I can say any other first step cleanser has provided.\n\nBecause of the lack of synthetic fragrance, PEG (in their most commonly known forms), and essential oils...I can see why this product has been an instant hot item. It plays into everything today’s skincare area is focusing on.\n\nI really think the issues I had with rinsing/removing could have been avoided had Glow Recipe left in some of the more common emulsifying ingredients. That is 100% personal preference, I know you may feel different, which is why I still think this is an excellent product for some.\n\nWhen it comes to an effective cleansing balm that rinses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling soft, non-irritated, and generally looking awesome...the crown still goes to the Then I Met You Living Cleansing Balm.\n\nI adore that product for its lovely/creamy/buttery texture, smooth application, and wonderful scent. Nothing else I have used has quite met the same bar (although several have come really close).\n\nThe Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm is a masterclass in taking what consumers are asking for...and creating something really special and results driven. While I do like nearly everything about it, the Living Cleansing Balm is still where my heart (and my wallet) remain.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Sorbitan Oleate, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Polyethylene, Aqua/Water/Eau, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Papain, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Alkanna Tinctoria Root Extract, Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Levulinic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Metabisulfite\n\nWhere To Buy (Glow Recipe Site $32.00 USD): [https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm](https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7kjld35vfi51.jpg?width=5216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a406da03f65bc98760d93eb963d0a0d8a29f5b39",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to this very special installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Eleven Shaving Unscented/Hendrix Classics & Co Commander](https://i.imgur.com/1Fvyt3Z.jpg)\n\nWelcome to what is probably the most unofficial special edition of the Great Spice Off I'll do. Yes, even more unofficial than the totally official [Remote Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/16a3t7s/the_great_spice_off_summer_break_soaps_remote/) one. There are few reasons for that, the first being that this soap isn't even scented at all. That's right, as the name boldly proclaims Eleven Unscented is, in fact, unscented. (Pro tip for the pros out there: just name your unscented soap unscented. It makes it so much easier to find.) How then could it possibly be part of the Great Spice Off? Well, that's where the second part of making this very unofficial comes in.\n\nI'm using Hendrix Classics & Co.'s scent yourself Commander scent oil in the Eleven's Julien base, which u/hendrix-classics-co sent me way back after I reviewed his [Commodore Old Spice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/y7o1ac/the_great_spice_off_hendrix_classics_co_commodore/) dupe. Confused yet? Well, you can go read my intro to Hendrix in that review as it all pretty much still stands, but the TL;DR is that Hendrix offers a scent yourself line (or use to, it's been taken down recently for a bit of a refresh) in which you get the scenting oil directly from him and then scent your own soap. The theory being is you'd get his unscented soap and then have a stock pile of different scents you can then use. I, however, am using it as an excuse to review a different base and, after polling the community, and randomly selecting one Eleven was the winner.\n\nNot only all of that, but Commodore isn't even an Old Spice dupe. It's an Old Spice Pure Sport dupe, a scent I have next to no experience with and made no effort to learn about. But its name has Old Spice in it and so.... here we are. Let's also add the caveats that I'm adding a scent oil to a base in a way the soapmaker did not plan for, meaning any results from my tests could be totally tainted. That is, however, why I did one shave without the scent in it to be a bit more fair, but that only makes everything even less above board. In short, trust nothing I say... honestly, that's probably good advice for this series in general.\n\nThat all being said, I am, also, always right and my opinions are the correct ones so lets get down to it. Eleven Shaving was founded by Paolo Licciardi sometime in the mid-teens as Sapone di Paulo, which is Italian for Soap by Paolo. His grandfather was an Italian barber and he named everything with Italian names. However, reading things in Italian is evidently very confusing for all of us simple-minded wet shavers. We, honestly, aren't too great at reading English let alone pronouncing other languages so he routinely heard people mispronounce the name or simply not say it at all. Thus, in 2018, he rebranded to Eleven soaps, named after Lock and Dam no. 11 located in Dubuque, Iowa, near where Eleven is based. Numbers are presumably easier for English speakers to speak than Italian words just don't ask us to add them together.\n\nWhat I absolutely adore about this, is that he took this lesson of KISS into every aspect of the brand with a recent redesign of his labels. I usually make mention of the tub design at the end but I have to just applaud the entire design theme behind Eleven Soaps new looks. Big, bold, simple label designs in big bold iconic fonts with no clutter, on clear tubs. In a world of wet shaving branding that's getting overrun with AI designs and stupidly busy labels or half-assed designs done in Word, Eleven's branding stands out fantastically. Not only is that mantra found in his branding but it seems at the core of his scenting as well, with minimal scents that hit a few key notes but never get crazy. I absolutely love that he took a rename to simplify things (the previous labels were just color coded) and worked that into his entire ethos and brand identity. It's really cool and fantastically refreshing. The Unscented soap has a simple, shades-of-blue, fleur de leaf, which might be the most abstract of his labels given most of the others have a simplistic image of whatever the main scent is (a lemon on lemon, an orange on orange, pine trees on cedar).\n\nOf course, I'm not really experiencing his scenting so all of that gushing is just about looks and not shave and as such let us move onto the soap itself. u/CanadaEh97 , who suggested Eleven, claims that they just came out with a new base but I can't find any information on that as Julien seems to be pretty old. The Julien base leans closer to the soft, sticky side of things but isn't an incredibly soft base by any measure. It's tallow-based, with an ingredient list of: Stearic Acid, Water, Tallow, Glycerin,  Potassium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Mango Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Grapeseed Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Silk, Sodium Lactate, Allantoin, Tocopherol Acetate. Nothing we haven't seen before except maybe the Apricot oil. I'd love an honest breakdown of what benefit all these different oils from different things do. Is Apricot that different from, say, banana oil (the latter obviously being how they make banana shaving soaps)?\n\nTo go back to the scent -- because this intro just needs to be even longer -- Old Spice Pure Sport is technically a riff on Old Spice from the makers themselves and probably the second longest-running Old Spice scent out there. You can easily find it on store shelves even in America in both deodorant and after shave splash. I don't have any and if I brought home another bottle of Old Spice I wouldn't be living in my house anymore so I'm not even going to pretend to comment on the accuracy of the scent to the one you can pick up in stores. There's also not much debate online of the scent having changed over the years in any way (it's nowhere near as old as the OG) so having a dupe of it seems a bit odd other than a way to get it into your shaving soap. People describe the scent as Old Spice but with sporty scent in it and... I don't care.\n\nTo explain he process a bit for these shaves, I put three drops of Commodore into my first and second shaves using different amounts of soap as I do for these reviews. For the final shave, I used no scent to experience Julien on its own.\n\n**Oldness - 3**\n\nThis is definitely an Old Spice scent. In fact, it's probably more Old Spice than some of the direct dupes I've done but it's also definitely not an old spice scent. It's like 50% an Old Spice scent and 50% not one in a way that, unlike other riffs on Old Spice, makes it somehow very different. Whereas the riffs I've tried kind of layer into Old Spice this is almost just like two scents running into each other. It's strangely both Old Spice and not at all.\n\n**Spiciness - 1**\n\nIf you couldn't tell by my general apathy in describing the scent above (and my lack fo desire to write more words, which I really like doing) Commander and, I assume, Pure Sport is just not for me. This is strange because at this point I am desperate for people to play around with the Old Spice scent (u/mammothben, I will never stop. Why won't you love me!?) and here is like the original Old Spice riff. It just doesn't work for me at all despite being pretty well enjoyed by those who enjoy smelling things and obviously liked enough by the general masses to be one of the few legacy scents that P&G still makes.\n\n**Lather - 4**\n\nJulien is big and thirsty and even when I used my smallest scoop I used too much. It just never stops growing. Most lathers hit a point where they start becoming slick and sloppy and kind of don't get bigger anymore. Julien does not. Julien goes on forever. If you continued lathering Julien it would eventually consume the world. It's possible that with the right amount of soap it would hit the sweet point and land a five here but I couldn't find it. Still, it's a big, easy lather ain't nuthn to scoff at.\n\n**Shave - 3**\n\nEleven has a good cushion to it, probably from getting bigger and bigger, which allows even aggressive blades to feel like great on your face but I don't think it was strikingly great. Similarly, the slickness is good, delivering a smooth shave, especially when you use less soap and can feed it enough water. It may have just been a dialing in issue with using too much soap but my shaves never hit that truly great slickness that the best soaps have. And please remember to caveat this with the fact that I was adding something in that could have somehow changed the end result but I got the same feeling on my third, no scent shave.\n\n**Post - N/A**\n\nI don't feel fair giving points for post here because it combines both scent and post shave feel, which here are delivered by two separate products. That's not to mention that the scenting is manual so any issue I had with it would could be easily changed by my own hand. I will say that Eleven left my face feeling pretty refreshed (totally the apricot, I'm sure) but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n**Lack of Scent - 5**\n\nYea, that's how unofficial this is. To make up for the N/A in Post Shave there's an entire extra rating section in here. Things have gone over the rails and we're in the crazy train now, fellas. I had no idea where to go into this and the intro was getting to long but when Eleven says unscented they mean it. I have smelled a few unscented soaps before and they all have some sort of scent, even if it's just small. Eleven Unscented isn't unscented, it is the absence of scent. When I closed my eyes and stuck this tub in my nose it was like nothing was there. I'm pretty sure it removed any other scents I might be smelling. It was like the shaving soap equivalent of reaching a perfectly clear mind and total peace.\n\n**Final Verdict: 16**\n\nNothing. Meaningless. Scores don't matter and the points are made up. The scent isn't from the soapmmaker, the soap isn't from the scent maker, and I made up an entire category. Fuck it!\n\nI'm sorry. You're experiencing a bit of an existential crisis here. I found out that I'm not actually as done as I thought I was with all this after even more soaps are cropping up. It's possible there will be 5-6 more Great Spice Offs and I'm having trouble coping with it when I thought I had finally reached the mountain top. I hate you all.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

        "body": "Its difficult to determine how much soap you can make with that anount of lye because the amount of lye you need to use depends on the recipe, and if you are gonna be experimenting with recipes, well, no way to say for sure. \n\nAny reason why you want to use apricot keenel? I ask because that tends to be an expensive oil, which most people prefer to use in leave in products like balms. Keep in mind that the properties or the oils, in oil form, is gonna be very different in soap form. And also soap is a wash off product that remains on the skin for only a few moments, so its not gonna do basically anything. If you are set on using it, the recomended amount is about 5-10%. This is because it may or may not lead to DOS and could inhibit bubbles. \n\nCocoa butter is better used at about 4-20% maybe a bit higher, but too much butters can lead to a soap that is brittle and they also lather, but are not bubbly. \n\nAnd castor oil is also better used at around 5-10% because too much can make a sticky soap and also inhibit lather. \n\nSo to me you are still missing some oils to make a nice soap. Coconut for example to make bubbles, at around 20-30%, maybe palm or lard or tallow for your hard oils. Or olive. \n\nWarning that mostly all botanicals will turn brown on soap. They also wont impart smell. You can use them as decoration, but they will still turn brown. And as exfoliants some can be very scratchy. \n\nYou need to use an EO calculator to figure out how much EO to use. https://www.eocalc.com/\n\nAnd check the usage for your FO’s. \n\nFor spatulas use silicone but the ones that are full silicone, not the ones with a wooden handle. For plastics use only the ones numbered 2 or 5, those can handle the lye or get stainless steel but not any other metal, particularly no aluminum. Also do not use glass because it breaks, because of the lye or you can drop it and you dont want that when you are handling something like lye. \n\nYou also need a stick blender, not a mixer. \n\nCitric acid can be used but you need to account for it in your lye calculations. \n\nInfused oils wont do anything in soap. No smell, no color and no properties. \n\nMake a small first batch, 500 grams or so, you do need a kitchen scale. Do not meassure anything in spoons or cups, all has to be weighted.\n\nMake a simple batch first with no color, no fragrance and no additives so you can familiarize yourself with the process, before you jump in to more complicated things. And make sure your fragrances are made for cold process soap making, because cheap soap fragrances usually are for melt and pour which do not work in cold process. \n\nThis is a great place with lots of good info https://classicbells.com/soap/soapyStuff.asp",

That along with the stick blender will help keep you out of the emergency room.\n\nUtensils should be either silicon, plastic (2 or 5), or stainless steel.\n\nDo not add Citric Acid to your soap without compensating for it.

I tried using castor oil at a 10-15% in my early days and not only was the soap super sticky when trying to unmold but slimy when used.  If you are going to try and use a mixer instead of a stick blender be very careful of the splashing they cause make sure you have on long sleeves and gloves.   Have you ran the recipe through soap calc yet, I just did assuming castor at 5% and cocoa butter at 20%  apricot kernel at 75% and it seems to make a pretty wonkey bar.  Definitely grab coconut oil and olive oil (if able) and you can make a great recipe.   Good luck and have fun!!",

        "body": "Honestly, the oils you have will not make great soap. You need an oil/butter that will add some cleansing and some hardness to your bar. Cocoa butter, when used at more than 15% can give lather a stringy/slimy feel.  Castor oil used at more than 10% can make your bar rather sticky. Apricot oil adds conditioning, but that's about it...and if you use a high percentage, you'll have a very soft bar that will turn to mush rather quickly.\n\nIf you are making CP, you absolutely do NOT want to use a Betty Crocker mixer because you'll introduce a ton of air into your batter...you'll need an immersion blender for CP. If you're doing HP, \"Betty\" will work, but it's not ideal. \n\nAt this point, don't worry about using citric acid, it isn't necessary for a good soap...and there are lye compensations that need to be made when using citric. I would wait until you're a little more experienced for that.\n\nI would say pick up some coconut oil and try something like this:\n\nApricot Kernal Oil -50%\n\nCastor Oil- 10%\n\nCocoa Butter - 15%\n\nCoconut Oil - 25%\n\nSet your superfat to 8%\n\n\\*\\*always run your recipe/formula through a soap calculator so you know the proper amount of lye to use\n\nIf you're doing CP, set your water ratio to maybe 1.9:1 so your soap doesn't take forever to dry out. If you're doing HP, full water is good.\n\nMake sure that you're not using anything with aluminum in it while you're soaping.\n\nMake sure you have rubber/nitrile gloves a safety glasses \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn an ideal world, I would also be adding some palm or shea to this formula, but given the supplies you have on hand, it will still make a decent soap without having to spend a lot more money",

I have asthma, and the ice method pretty much eliminates fumes, and helps to extend mixing time if you want to do drop swirls or layers, or other designs. Just gives you more time before it sets.

        "body": "The first time i made soap i used 60% coconut oil and 40% grapeseed oil, sodium hydroxide, water and that's it. I used an old plastic cup to mix the lye and water, and heated the oils in an old stainless steel pot on the stove. I mixed everything with a wooden spoon. I recommend going simple. Others have suggested a stick blender, but i have never had an issue hand mixing CP soap.\n\nIt's important to be careful with the lye, it can burn your skin, your eyes, and you don't want to get in on clothes. Never use any utensils that have touched lye for food! keep the utensils/bowls separate from anything you would use for regular cooking and wash by hand. If lye gets on your skin, wash well.\n\nMeasure the ingredients and use a soap calculator. I recommend a thermometer to check temps with. Use the minimum recommended amount of water and a high superfat (8% was suggested in another comment). Always add solid lye to the water, and add the water/lye mixture to the oils. Be patient when waiting for it to thicken to trace. I also recommend writing everything down so you can refer to it for when you make a second batch and you can perfect your recipes.",

    "body": "It's everywhere you look. \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ will kill your beard.\" and \"Doing \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ will make your beard suck.\"\n\nIs it true? Is it hype? Is there actual tangible benefits to cutting these things out?\n\nThe answer is a resounding yes. Failing to properly take care of your beard leads to brittle, thin, and dull looking hair through a process called **oxidative stress.** Let's get into it!\n\nOxidative stress in hair happens when there's an imbalance between free radicals (unstable oxygen molecules) and antioxidants. Basically, you have all kinds of stuff going on that's causing oxidation, and not enough antioxidants to neutralize it. The oxidation is then free to go to work on the cellular structure of your hair, and the stress of this, over time, leads to all kinds of bad juju like weakened hair structure, premature graying, and even hair loss.\n\nThere are SO many things that cause oxidative stress, and knowing about them, how bad they really impact your beard health, and how to prevent them is key to having a big healthy beard.\n\n**It's important to know that oxidation is inevitable**. Time is the biggest cause of oxidation. We can't stop it from happening. But, combatting oxidation is often as simple as increasing the consumption and use of antioxidant rich foods and care products.\n\nCauses of oxidative stress can from both the inside and outside of our bodies. **Internal causes** are usually lifestyle choices, but can sometimes also be biological. We'll go over these first.\n\n**-Nutritional deficiencies** are at the top of the list, and one of the leading causes of oxidative stress.  It's wildly important to consume a healthy amount of antioxidants and nutrients to prevent this.\n\n\\-**Chronic Stress!** Stress hormones (cortisol) trigger free radical production.\n\n\\-Both **drinking and smoking** increase circulating free radicals, which are linked to premature graying and hair follicle miniaturization. (I quit 3 years ago! Yeah!)\n\n\\-**Reduced blood flow** (often linked to heart disease, high cholesterol, or diabetes) means less oxygen and fewer antioxidants ever even reach hair follicles.\n\nSometimes, these issues are a bit more out of our control and come from outside of our bodies. Some **external causes** of oxidative stress are:\n\n\\-**UV rays** (from sun exposure) generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that directly cause keratin degradation through oxidation, making hair brittle and faded over time.\n\n\\-**Air pollution**. Smoke, heavy metals, oxides, and dioxides all generate free radicals like crazy.\n\n\\-**Hard water** causes some serious mineral buildup and oxidation. High levels of **chlorine** strips antioxidants from hair, making it more prone to oxidative breakdown.\n\n\\-**Harsh hair products and dyes** contain peroxides, sulfates, and harsh surfactants that strip away antioxidants.\n\n\\-**Synthetic fragrances** and **preservatives** often contain aldehydes and parabens, which mess with the hair's natural protective barrier and make it easier for oxidation to happen.\n\n\\-**Too much heat exposure** (blow dryers, straighteners) breaks keratin bonds and sucks out moisture, accelerating oxidation. This is lessened by pretreatment with heat protection products, but not entirely avoidable.\n\nThere are so many factors and forces at play that allows oxidation to wreak havoc on our hair. It takes just a little self care, but preventing this stress is the best way to grow that big ol' beard.\n\nSo, the main reason you're here and reading this:\n\n**How to combat oxidative stress!**\n\nNow that you know what’s causing the things that cause it, and how it’s wrecking your beard, let’s talk about what you can actually do to fight it. The good news is that preventing and reversing oxidative damage isn’t rocket science. It just takes the right approach and intention.\n\n**Load up on antioxidants and nutrients that prevent oxidation.**\n\nSince oxidative stress is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, the best thing you can do is tip the scales back in your favor by reducing free radical production, preventing oxidation, and providing your body enough antioxidants to prevent and reverse damage. Lack of B12, folic acid, iron, copper, zinc, and vitamin D specifically contributes a ton, so look at your diet and make some adjustments if need be! \"Polyphenols\" are found in berries, green tea, and dark chocolate, and they neutralize free radicals.  \"Carotenoids\" are found in carrots, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes, and they protect cells by absorbing oxidative energy.  Garlic, onions, and vegetables like broccoli and cabbage (cruciferous) contain sulfur compounds that boost up your body’s natural antioxidant defenses and production. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts slow damage to cells. Glutathione, the body's master antioxidant, is produced in the liver, but also found in foods like asparagus, avocados, and spinach.\n\nFor the external battle, hemp seed oil is loaded down with polyphenol and tocopherol (vitamin E), which are badass antioxidants. Avocado oil is rich in carotenoids, vitamin E, and monounsaturated fats that shield hair from oxidative damage. Grapeseed oil is SUPER high in proanthocyanidins, a rarer class of antioxidants that combat free radicals directly. Sweet almond oil contains a ton of vitamin E. Apricot kernel oil contains phytosterols and vitamins A and E.\n\nThere are so many good foods and good oils we can use on our bodies to combat oxidation as it's happening. This is the best way to give your body what it needs to fight back!\n\n**Protect against UV damage.**\n\nThis is easy. Avoid too much sun. Just like on your skin. Sunscreen helps your skin. Use a beard oil rich in vitamin E to help absorb and neutralize UV radiation.\n\n**Avoid harsh products and pollutants where you can!**\n\nStay away from sulfates and harsh surfactants. These strip away natural oils and leave your hair vulnerable to oxidation. Use a pH-balanced beard wash. Limit exposure to hard water. If you live in a pollution heavy area (cities, near factories, etc), rinsing your beard with filtered water or using a leave-in oil barrier can help a ton. Ditch synthetic fragrances and preservatives. Many contain aldehydes and parabens that make your hair more prone to oxidation and damage.\n\n**Reduce stress and improve circulation.**\n\nLower your cortisol levels. Trust me, I get this is hard. But chronic stress leads to increased free radical production, which is so bad in so many ways. For your hair, heart, skin, etc. Try to address what's stressing you out. Your body will thank you. Exercise, meditation, or even just getting enough sleep helps mitigate this as well. Stretch and exercise to improve overall circulation. Increase blood flow to your follicles through regular exfoliation and good beard oils.\n\n**Minimize damage from heat.**\n\nTurn down the heat some. Blow drying on high heat or using straighteners daily can break down keratin bonds and dry out your beard significantly, leaving room for major oxidative damage. Alway use a heat protectant. A good beard oil provides a natural barrier to help reduce moisture loss.\n\n**Hydrate and reinforce moisture retention!**\n\nA well-hydrated beard is less prone to oxidative damage. Drink plenty of water to keep your skin and follicles hydrated. Use penetrating oils that actually absorb to create a healthy cellular hair structure that holds moisture well.\n\n  \n  \n**The wrap up:**\n\nYou can’t stop oxidation entirely. It's coming, and it's caused by TONS of little things. But, we can def slow it down. Taking good care of your beard means reducing oxidative stress wherever possible and loading up on the right antioxidant rich food and products to neutralize free radicals before they cause lasting damage. This is best done from inside and out. Antioxidants in your food will help with oxidation in your skin and follicles, but remember that nothing transfers from your body to your pre-existing hair. Antioxidants need to be applied externally to help as well. Remember that the more you do to protect and nourish your beard, the longer it’ll grow, the stronger it'll be, and the better it'll look.\n\nKeep on bearding strong, y'all!\n\n\\-Brad",

    "body": "Botica Botanica perfume oils are made using essential oils, concretes, absolutes and resins. The perfume oils are blended with apricot kernel oil. The solid perfumes are blended with beeswax, coconut oil and apricot kernel oil. The TAT and shipping were very fast, and arrived to me within a week, and the reducers on the small sample size dram bottles make them easy to use and apply. \n\n[Botica Botanica Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/BoticaBotanica)\n\n**Davana & Oud** (*Dried fruit, vanilla, oud, oakmoss, hay*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nI can smell the dried fruit and vanilla right off the bat. The hay is faint – it’s very sweet and grassy. It’s slightly spicy, but very warm. This smells amazing. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nWithin the first five minutes, the dried fruit notes take on this slightly sweet raisiny quality. After 15-30 minutes, it takes on the more spicy tones that I was whiffing from the bottle, and the vanilla and oud are really warming up the scent nicely on my skin. It’s a very warm, fruity (in a berry-sense) vanilla scent. It’s not too sweet, but it does have a tad of sweetness. The hay and oakmoss might lead you to believe that this scent would lean more toward warm, woody and spicy with a hint of green earthiness, but, at least on my skin, it dried to a warm, vanilla-mellowed oud with a hint of fruitiness. Oh my, one of my favorite scents from Botica. The scent intensity is moderate and lasts 6-7 hours on the skin. \n\n**Corona del Mar** (*Sand, sunscreen, salt water, citrus, coconut, bonfire*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nI’ve smelled some aquatics that are salty from seaweed right out of the bottle, like Narwhal from Exoskeletons. This one is different. It’s citrusy, slightly creamy, woody, and there’s a slight tinge of saltiness. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nI can smell the saltiness. But, there’s a little bit of that creamy, slightly coconutty, suntan lotion smell, and a smoky, woodsy character. Super interesting, and it smells much more smoky than briny. When I sniff it on my skin, it goes back and forth between smoky and woody, and creamy and salty. It’s very well blended. As it dries down, I get a hint of the creaminess, saltiness, smokiness and woody character, and all together it combines to make me feel like I’m on a driftwood beach. I can picture that in my mind’s eye. If you’re a fan of aquatics, you’re definitely going to want to give this a try. This scent is definitely one of my favorite aquatic/marine scents. The scent intensity is moderate, and lasts 6-7 hours on the skin. \n\n**Sequoia** (*Fir, sequoia, dry leaves, conifer needles, resinous tree sap, forest floor, amber*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nI can smell the fir, as well as this dirt and mossy undertone. It’s almost like a mushroom type earthy smell, and it definitely makes me think of a forest floor. This is a very earthy green scent. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nIf you’re wanting to find a more earthy forest scent. This is it. On my wrist, it’s like I’m taking my time to bend my nose to the ground and take a big whiff. The fir is stronger at first, but doesn’t last long. As it dries down, the green earthiness of the oakmoss, I’m assuming, comes out, and I would swear there’s a mushroom element in here. This is one of those perfumes that evokes the feeling I’m getting, and this is a far different green, forest scent than I’ve ever tried before. It doesn’t smell like the typical forest perfume I’ve smelled with  pine, black spruce, and the like. When it dried down fully, the warmth from the amber is there, but the green earthiness is very prominent. A fascinating perfume and one of my favorites because of how unique it is. The scent intensity was moderate and lasted 6-7 hours on my skin.\n\n**Lost Blues No. 2** (*Bergamot, frankincense, cedarwood, black spruce*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nI can smell the citrusy tones of the bergamot, and the woody character from the cedarwood. This woody scent has a vegetal tone, almost like a green grassy-ness. I was thinking, this smells familiar, and I sniff again. If I’m not paying attention, when I sniff, I feel like I’m smelling from a bottle of turmeric. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nWhen it touches my skin, I don’t get any of that turmeric at all. It’s spruce and cedarwood, and the bergamot is very understated, it just provides this freshness to the scent. As it begins to dry down, I still get this turmeric-like scent. When it dries down completely, I still get a hint of the turmeric element if I really carefully sniff, but, overall, the scent is woody, warm and a little spicy. It may be the black spruce, or just the combination, but it’s not one of my favorite scents in the bunch. The scent intensity was moderate and lasted 6-7 hours on my skin.\n\n**Wild Honey** (*Honey, wildflowers, magnolia blossoms, crushed grass*)\n\t\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nThe scent out of the bottle is a pure honey scent, almost like you’re sniffing from a bottle of honey, but deeper. When I sniff a second time, I can smell the magnolia, and it smells heavenly. It’s a sweet floral, but not too sweet. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nThe honey and magnolia both come full force. However, this is one of the few perfumes that I can tell you I can actually smell the crushed grassy notes as described. It’s sweet, floral, and grassy. It smells exactly like a meadow to me. You can definitely smell the magnolia, but it’s not overpowering, it’s subdued just enough to create this fresh, spring floral smell, with honey and grass to compliment the scent. One of my favorites. The scent intensity is moderate, and this one lasted slightly longer than some of the others, about 7-8 hours.\n\n**Jasmine ’49** (*Jasmine, tobacco, tonka, Bourbon vanilla, amber*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nLike a caramel-vanilla jasmine, and it’s not too sweet either. It’s warm from the amber, comforting and inviting. It’s slightly sweet, but not cloying, and floral. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nIt’s sweet, but not too sweet on the skin. The caramel tone from the tonka is warm and rich, but not overwhelmingly so, and plays well with the bourbon vanilla on my wrist. It’s sweet, floral goodness. The tobacco provides a fresh, slightly herbaceous feel, but it’s not truly discernible. It just prevents the jasmine from being overbearingly floral, and melds seamlessly with the tonka, vanilla and jasmine. This is a truly satisfying combination, and is one of my favorite jasmine scents. The scent intensity was moderate and lasted 6-7 hours on my skin.\n\n**Amber Lavender** (*Lavender, amber*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nIt’s pretty self-explanatory. The amber is warm, and the lavender is a nice floral contrast. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nIt may be self-explanatory, but the balance for this scent is right on target. Neither the amber or lavender overpower the other. This is really nice – the floral lavender and amber really meld and it’s very familiar, but mysterious at the same time. It’s a very comforting smell, and if you’re afraid of the lavender smelling very herbal, like it does in some scents, I would suggest that you try this one. This may be one of my favorite lavender scents. The scent intensity is moderate, and this one lasted slightly longer than some of the others, about 7-8 hours.\n\n**Verdure** (*Rose, fern, oakmoss, soil*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nI love this rose scent. It’s like a fresh cut rose scent, and reminds me of cutting roses from the bush in my parent’s garden. Hard to describe - it’s earthy, but fresh and floral at the same time. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nWhen I dab the oil on my wrist, the green and earthiness from the oakmoss comes out much more on the skin. It’s warm, earthy and floral from the rose. It’s almost like you rubbed a rose in dirt, in a good way – it’s one of those satisfying earthy scents. As it dries down, the scent develops this slightly smoky, spicy wood smell on my wrist, almost like cinnamon. This is definitely one of the more unique rose scents I’ve tried, and liked it a lot. The scent intensity was moderate and lasted 6-7 hours on my skin.\n\n**Tobacco & Rose** (*Damask rose, blonde tobacco, leather, vetiver*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nThe tobacco is subdued, and marries well with the rose when I sniff from the bottle. It’s fresh, herbaceous and floral, with a little bit of woody character. The scent also smells like it has a slight leather tinge. \n\n*On My Skin*\n\nOhh my gosh. This is so unique when wet. Not like any of the normal botanical leather scents that I have smelled. It’s almost like hay, wood chips from inside a lawn supply store, and then tobacco, but, with the rose, as well? So trippy. The rose only faintly comes out to play when it’s dried down after a couple of hours of wear. The rose is very nice, and I have a feeling that I like Damask rose – this rose scent is clean, sweet and not overpowering. However, the entire scent is very strong and powerful. I don’t know if I like the scent itself, but this is hands down one of the most unique scents I have tried. It’s smoky, woody and grassy, but with a leathery-tobacco tinge. You know the best words to describe this perfume? Animalic and musky. If you’re looking for a scent like that, try this one out. The scent intensity is moderate to strong, and this one lasted longer on the skin than some of the others, about 7-8 hours.\n\n**Vernal Equinox** (*Palo santo, white sage, frankincense, juniper, smoke, cedarwood*)\n\n*Out of the Bottle*\n\nThe scent is sweet and woody when I smell from the bottle. I get the sweet, warm palo santo, although I think the sage and frankincense keep it from leaning too much toward an incense-vibe, and it’s so comforting.\n\n*On My Skin*\n\nWhen it touches the skin, it’s slightly smoky, woody and sweet. Personally, it’s one of my favorites when I’m smelling from the bottle, but I like it only slightly less when it dries down on the skin. As it dries down, I can smell the woody, freshness from the sage, juniper and cedarwood, and they combine so well with the other notes. To me, when it’s dried down, it’s not quite smoky, but just, fresh, sweet, herbal, slightly spicy and woody. An interesting scent. It reminds me of a Christmas-type scent, with the sage, juniper and frankincense, but, at the same time, not really like any of them at all. The scent intensity was moderate and lasted 6-7 hours on my skin.\n\n**Brand Overview**\n\nI really liked Davana & Oud, Corona del Mar, Wild Honey, Jasmine ’49, Sequoia, Verdure, and Vernal Equinox, and am seriously considering full sizes of most of them. The scents I didn’t like were Lost Blues No. 2 and Tobacco & Rose. However, they are unique, and I would highly recommend trying all of them if the notes appeal to you.\n\nWhile trying scents from this shop, I couldn’t help but keep thinking, that as many scents as I’ve tried, these scents are extremely unique. It was a very good experience, and I hope to try more products in the future. \n\nNote: I am not affiliated with this brand.

I've read that peppermint lowers testosterone, is this also true when applied topically? Also, should I apply PEO after dermarolling (better absorption) or stay away from it for 24 hours?(might enter the blood stream and have detrimental effects on testosterone)\n3. How often should I apply PEO, about 1-2x per day?\n4. I have a 0,5mm dermaroller, how often should I use it, about 2-3x per week?\n\nThis might all be a fluke, but I figured it's worth the shot.

I'm a water shower only person and use a skin probiotic for my pits. For one who doesn't use much soap, oddly, fragranced soaps have been on my radar.\n\nLast month I bought a sample of Fzotic Toasted Lilac soap. I use it to wash my hands and I have got to tell you it just permeates the air so beautifully. There's this wonderful lilac scent in the air after you use it, as well as on your hands. For those of you who like a soapy smell, there is none here. \n\nAs much as I like Toasted Lilac, I'm not that much of a floral soap person, so I decided to get the rest of Fzotic soaps, and here they are. The whole set is I think $30 at Luckyscent. Along with the set I got two free samples, of my choice, Jovoy *Remember Me* and April Aromatics *Vetiver Coeur*. The soaps are 2.8 oz each and could easily be full size. However they're not; if you buy the full size Fzotic soap you're going to get a larger chunk of soap. I haven't yet tried the Honey Cedar or Black Suède, but the dry bars smell delicious. I can see why these are sold out at the Fzotic web site. \n\nThe soap itself, made in the Savon de Marseilles tradition, is rich and non-drying. I even use a little bit on my face. \n\n*Fragrance Notes:*\n\nToasted Lilac: Lilac, toast, sweet cream   \nBlack Suede; Leather, spice, brown sugar, white musk   \nHoney Cedar: Cedar, honey, spice, tobacco\n\n*Main soap ingredients*: Olive oil, coconut oil, sustainably sourced palm oil, water, sodium hydroxide (none remains after saponification), fragrance, shea butter, apricot kernel oil, vitamin E, sea salt. \n\n*Additional ingredients:*   \nHoney Cedar: yellow kaolin clay   \nBlack Suede:  iron oxide, charcoal   \n\nI also tried January Scent Project soaps. Their scents have a warm tang which leads me to think they're better suited for a masculine skin.",

    "body": "Hello,\n\n\nI've got a question regarding this body lotion - it's from a European brand Mixa called Panthenol Comfort but also named in some countries as Mixa Atopiance. It's marketed for dry and atopy prone skin for both babies and adults. It costs around 6$ for 400ml. Now, my skin is normal leaning to oily but dehydrated a good bit, handles actives really well and I get maybe a couple pimples in a month, so not overly problematic. \n\n\nI'm currently in the market for a nice rich (preferably cheap) moisturizer for my PM routine and I bought this one based on the ingredients and the price, primarily for my month old big leg tattoo but it seems to me there shouldn't be any issues using it on my face as well. I put it on last night after cleansing and a HA face mist and this morning my face felt nice and nourished, no breakouts or whiteheads.\n\n\nSo my question is, what do you think about its ingredients? Do you think it could be harmful to consistently use it in on my face in the PM routine? Here's the ingredients list:\n\n\n**AQUA / WATER • GLYCERIN • PETROLATUM • PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM / MINERAL OIL • NIACINAMIDE • GLYCERYL STEARATE • CETYL ALCOHOL • PEG-40 STEARATE • BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER • CETYL PALMITATE • DIMETHICONE • ASCORBYL PALMITATE • CHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE • CITRIC ACID • CORIANDRUM SATIVUM SEED OIL / CORIANDER SEED OIL • ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM SEED OIL • GLYCINE SOJA OIL / SOYBEAN OIL • PANTHENOL • PRUNUS ARMENIACA KERNEL OIL / APRICOT KERNEL OIL • RIBES NIGRUM SEED OIL / BLACK CURRANT SEED OIL • SORBITAN TRISTEARATE • TOCOPHEROL (F.I.L.

    "body": "Hello /r/SkincareAddiction and fellow OCMmers!  A little over a month ago I ordered a sample pack of oils from GoW and have been cleansing daily.  I ordered Castor Oil, Jojoba Oil Gold (organic), Hazelnut Oil, and Camellia Seed Oil.  They also included an apricot kernel oil sampler, and I think one of my mistakes was adding a few drops of this to my 1oz bottle of cleansing mix as it's slightly more comedogenic and maybe made my mix include too many things?  Anyway:\n\n\nMy cleansing mix:\n\n*  1/2 castor\n\n*  1/3 jojoba\n\n*  1/6 hazelnut\n\n\nMy moisturizer\n\n*  2/3 hazelnut\n\n*  1/3 camellia seed oil\n\n\nMy process:\n\n*  Wash hands\n\n* with cleansing oil mix, 4 drop on forehead, 3 on each cheek, two on chin.  Massage into face for a few minutes\n\n*  Wipe off with clean washcloth soaked in warm/hot water (not too hot)\n\n*  Pat face dry with clean towel\n\n*  3 drops of moisturizing oil on fingers to massage into skin, focusing mainly around the eye area and avoiding eyebrows.  Only lightly moisturize in biggest problem areas.\n\n\nMy biggest problem area is down along my chin.  I have many small blackheads and white heads, and I'm really bad about putting my hand there when I'm thinking or resting my head on my hand.  I'm trying *really* hard to be better about it, but I think that's probably a good start to my problem.  But besides that, for the last few months I've been getting small zits and whiteheads popping up around my temples and forehead more, and even the occasional red zit randomly on my cheek (what?) where I have no other type of acne or skin irritation.  My skin has typically been very clear, so it was odd for me to not only have more \"stuff\" cropping up, but for my skin to feel more oily in general.  I felt like my skin was dry and on the oilier side.  I'm kind of a grungy person--I've been fortunate enough to have pretty clear skin all my life, but it's left me with some very poor face cleansing and moisturizing habits.\n\n\nThe OCM has definitely helped with the oiliness and eliminated the dryness I had from winter, but I feel like I'm still struggling a bit with the stuff along my chin.  If I miss more than a day of cleansing, stuff comes back around my temples.  The OCM does seems to help with clearing up zits once they do pop up.  I've never been one to squeeze at or touch them, so that helps too.  I took a few photos throughout the process so I could do a before-and-after, and honestly, I feel like it looks about the same:\n\n\n[Chin Album](http://imgur.com/a/mKPo4) \n\n\n[Forehead](http://imgur.com/ZCdaIoL)\n(I'm going to have to fix this later, somehow I wasn't logged in and now I can't edit this D: )\n\n\nI guess it was clearing up in the middle, but as you can see, a few days without cleansing and I'm literally right back where I started.  I think making a scrub might help to unclog the pores since it seems like the same ones are clogged, not that new ones are showing up.  Any recipe suggestions?  Any oils I should be using?  Any oils I'm already using that I shouldn't be?  Anything I'm doing wrong in my process?  Any feedback is greatly appreciated!",

What I'm going to try real soon is simplifying mine down to 2/3 jojoba and 1/3 castor. I add a little bit of tea tree to that mix and also use it as a spot treat. You might try some tea tree on your chin...patch test - i can use it straight with no problem, but some people have reactions. Another great reason to have tea tree around the house, anyway: if you put it on a mosquito bite right after it happens, I swear to everything it goes away immediately and no itch or bump.\n\nI also got the St. Ives pads - the stuff on your chin does look like clogged pores and a chem exfoliant might help with that...only at night, the AHA or whatever causes photosensitivity.\n\nI should mention that I do my whole OCM routine only at night - I was getting super oily during the day, so I cut back a bunch. I use it to take off makeup, rub with cloth like you do and I only add more if I'm feeling dry/tight. In the morning, I just splash water on my face - no product.\n\nEDIT: Also, if you're generally liking the routine, stick with it a bit longer....I've been doing it about 3 months and feel like I'm finally getting to a super awesome place with it. I had the same random spots pop up like you've had, I've had the overly oily days, and I had a mega-hormonal break out recently, but I seem to have evened out the oiliness and my break outs are never very bad any more. I used to have a terrible time with the area around my nose and my chin, and it's a million times better now.",

When I started OCM I was given a mix of about 1/10 castor oil, and the rest was a jojoba/sunflower seed mix (not sure the ratio). I added some tea tree oil on my own, and that had my skin completely clear (from acne prone) for several months. I started drying out about 3 months in, so I tested with EVOO alone for a couple of days to make sure my skin didn't mind, then diluted my mixture about halfway with that. My dryness problems are gone. I do have the first occurrence of cystic acne right now for the first time in the 6 months since I started OCM, but I was on vacation and eating a lot of fast food so I put more blame on that than anything. \n\nSo anyway...\n\nTry all your oils alone (except maybe castor. I imagine by itself it can be extremely drying) and see how your skin reacts to each one. One might leave you feeling a little greasy, one maybe dry, but if one leaves you broken out you know to eliminate that one completely. My current routine contains 5 different oils and I haven't had any problem, so I don't think *just* too many ingredients on its own is a problem.",

The downside of this is that no skin care routine improves my redness, blemishes and blackheads/bumps. I haven't found any product or routine that makes a dramatic difference to my skin, it just keeps on keeping on.\n\nThe biggest change I've seen in my skin is when my doctor changed my pill about 2 months ago - that's when I found this sub and got interested in skin care. Until now I've been pretty haphazard, using a mix of products depending on what I felt like that day - no routine or anything. The main change I noticed, apart from more pimples, is that my skin became more oily - even my hair was more greasy than usual. \n\nI'm nearly at the end of the small bottle I mixed using the ingredients above. What are people's opinions about trying a different mix or sticking longer with the one I made before? I also have avocado oil, macadamia oil, and grapeseed oil is easily available in the supermarket. I've also got some jojoba and argan oil on the way from iHerb.\n\nI purposefully avoided mineral oil and EVOO since people seem to have divided opinions about those oils, but am considering mineral oil since several people have said it's good for getting \"grainy stuff\" out of your face and I certainly have a lot of forehead bumps.\n\nI should add that both of my brothers and my mum had terrible cystic acne and bacne, all three of them have been on Roaccutane at some point. Compared to them I got away with beautiful skin!\n\nSo my routine is:\n\nMorning: tone with witch hazel and tea tree toner OR Simple toner (both alcohol free), moisturise with Simple Light OR Rich moisturiser (depending how I feel), sometimes BB cream and powder. I will be adding a sunscreen soon as I have ordered one of the La Roche Posay ones from the UK (thanks to this sub :) )\n\nDuring the day: Body Shop tea tree blotting tissues for oil (the little tiny green ones)\n\nEvening: OCM with the above blend, toner as for morning, spot treat red pimples with tea tree oil, then Simple night cream OR a few drops of avocado oil to moisturise. If I have worn makeup that day I usually use a Simple face wipe to get most of it off before OCM (I know you don't have to but I like to do it anyway).\n\nQuestions: am I doing anything wrong? Is there anything I should add? Should I mix up a new oil blend just for kicks, or stick with the one I've been using? I have ordered Stridex in the red box, at what step should I use it? How long should OCM take to make a difference to skin? I read on a few websites that lavender is a good oil for skin, but some people seem to think it's irritating - your thoughts?\n\nWow... I have a lot of questions. I just want to say a big thanks to this sub community, I read every thread and you have answered so many of my questions about skin care and fed my lust for new beautiful skin care products! Would love to hear your thoughts on my routine.",

Just test patch everything before you full blown use it, is the real big advice.\n\nLavender won't really do too much, so you can stop adding that in if so desired.\n\nI do think a BHA will be helpful to include to help cut through the pores.\n\nAlso, talking to a derm could be helpful too, and looking in to getting a retinoid.",

I used to break out on my cheeks, and my new acne has erupted on my jaw, chin, and under my jaw area on my neck. I get a few spots on my cheeks and temples. The PIH makes it look so much worse. I have also developed nodular acne, and it often takes a while to come to a head.\n\n\nI have added a lot, and now I am going back to a basic routine in the hopes that I'll cut out whatever product might be causing this and perhaps to treat any over-exfoliating I may be doing.\n\n\nI started birth control a few weeks ago, which I will continue using. I know it's not the culprit since the acne existed before it.\n\nMy new routine will be:\n\nAM:\n\n-Konjac sponge w/ water\n\n-Cerave PM\n\n-EltaMD sunscreen\n\n\n\nPM:\n\n-Remove make-up with apricot kernel oil (hope it's not the oil lol)\n\n-Wash face with Noble bar soap (this is a new addition, may go back to CeraVe hydrating)\n\n-Epiduo\n\n-Cerave PM\n\n-Vaseline or Aquaphor\n\n\n\n\nNon-daily:\n\n-Raw honey mask\n\n\n\nI will be cutting out:\n\n-neem oil\n\n-rosehip oil (I don't want to, but maybe just in case...)\n\n-Stridex \n\n-some MB cream\n\n-Avene Cleanance K (original formula)\n\n\n\nI don't think my routine was ever super complex, but I used all of the above products with little consistency. I think I will use my basic routine for two weeks, then re-introduce the Avene Cleanance K for chemical exfoliation.

My scarves may also be breaking me out since it's winter, but I don't remember them breaking me out like this in the past. I also try to wash my scarves once every two weeks.\n\nAny input?

I received this soap as a sample from my friend @Blacksheepshaving from Instagram. And you may notice, the change of scenery as I am currently on the road for business.  \n\nThe scent on Hedeby is that of the well know Green Irish Tweed. The scent, as with all GIT scents is floral and grassy on an aquatic base. The scent strength is medium off the sample and remains medium once lathered.  \n\nThis tallow soap features and impressive ingredient list Tallow, Stearic Acid, Water, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Oil, Aloe Vera Juice, Glycerin, Castor Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate, Mango Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Shea Butter, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Oats, Lanolin. Considering that it retails for $10.75 for 5.5 oz, this soap is a bargain.  \n\nThe performance on the soap is good. The cushion, slickness and post shave are in the space with other artisans in the tallow shaving soap space. While this soap does not excel in any area, it is a good soap that punches above its price point.",

Every time I put it on, I can't stop huffing my nails, and I'd absolutely love a perfume with a similar vibe for everyday wear. I think the notes are fruity/floral. It's delicate, clean, and no-fuss. It smells like the universally pleasant smell after you wash your hair with many popular drug store shampoos.\n\n**Can anyone recommend perfumes that smell similar? Cruelty-free brands are preferred.**\n\nHere are some scents in my collection that have a similar vibe to what I'm looking for:\n\n* Fine'ry: Flower bed\n* Floral Street: Sweet almond blossom\n\nHere's the ingredient list in the Essie cuticle oil: Runus armeniaca kernel oil / apricot kernel oil, simmondsia chinensis seed oil / jojoba seed oil, tocopheryl acetate, parfum / fragrance, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, hexyl cinnamal, helianthus annuus seed oil / sunflower seed oil, benzyl alcohol, ci 75120 / annatto, limonene, tocopherol.\n\nEdit: Budget isn't a huge factor since I always buy decants first and luckily prefer 10 mL travel bottles to full-sized :)\n\n# Edit 2: I FOUND IT!\n\n**Osmanthe Liu Yuan by Le Jardin Retrouvé**.  I love the invigorating shampoo-y apricot notes, as well as the added depth and dare I say sexiness from the jasmine and leather notes. I'm normally not a patchouli fan, but it's extremely subtle in this. It just adds to the warm, rich undertones. You can order small 2ml samples directly from their website for \\~$5 USD.\n\nHere are the fragrance descriptions from the website:\n\n* \"You stroll along the galleries of this millenium garden, savouring the different landscapes that reveal themselves to you as you move forward. You approach the water and encounter upright rocks with evocative shapes. On one of them stands a precious bottle. When you open it, a scent escapes. Its notes of osmanthus, peach, leather, jasmine and iris fill your heart with memories and stir your imagination Life here takes on its true meaning.\"\n* Top notes: Mandarin, Blackcurrant, Green notes\n* Heart notes: Osmanthus, Jasmine, Iris\n* Base notes: Peach/Apricot, Patchouli, Leather, Musk",

I was also confused how my flavour oil which worked for pretty much all of my previous recipes could not be smelled at all in this one, and after a bit more research i remembered that sometimes you can't smell it if it's been in too hot of a mixture. the thing is if i let it cool too much it will begin to set and i won't be able to pour it. does anyone have any advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: my caps button on my laptop is faulty and i didn't realise until after i typed this whole thing out and i don't have time to go back and add them. sorry about that :)",

Balms will create an occlusion on the skin, which is a barrier that acts as a protective seal to prevent transepidermal water loss. Be sure to drink lots of water, and you could even pair a light sugar scrub (washed off with water) as preparatory care before applying the balm. \n\nAs far as the flavor oil goes, indeed the scent won’t be noticeable if added at typical percentages at too high of a temperature. They’ll “evaporate” off. In the past I have experimented with allowing the concoction to cool just enough (constantly stirring) to where it’s a beaker full of gummy product at 104*F (which helps the vitamin E retain its antioxidant properties, as that ingredient is heat sensitive) and added my flavor oil and vitamin e before working it into their respective containers. \n\nThat being said, the above method is a pain in the ass. If you wanted to leave everything to a pour, I would experiment with finding out what the lowest temperature  at which the formula remains liquid, before any solids start forming at (taking into account the fact that adding the flavor oil and pouring will slightly lower the temperature as well) and add the flavor oil right before you pour, and maybe even moving to the upper limit of allowance if it’s not smelling as it should.",

BTMS 25 doesn't have a lot of emulsifying power to it, and I am pretty sure that 5% isn't going to emulsify 45% oils. If we generously assume that BTMS 25 is about as powerful as a standard e-wax used at 25% of the total oil phase (everything not water or water soluble), 10% BTMS 25 might emulsify 40% oil phase under ideal circumstances, but that isn't really true and I would use something else instead.\n\nIf you are determined to try it, I would remove 5% (10g) shea butter and add 5% (10g) BTMS 25, and I would put the Optiphen plus in during the emulsification process once the temperature is below 80 C to give it the best shot at staying emulsified.\n\nMost body butter type lotion formulas have at least 60% water, and often more. Usually a lot lower in butters too. They don't build viscosity in an emulsion the way fatty alcohols do.",

My bathroom now tilts towards my cosmetics bag!  \n\nThese cover an array of active ingredients between them, and I have seen a HUGE improvement to my skin (*tip of the hat, gang*)\n\nNow my question is, how do I combine them all to avoid reactions/killing off potential benefits and boost best effects?  What product should I use when?  How often should I use them???  \n\n\n*About me: 37yo, F, normal to slightly dry skin - prone to some sensitivities, esp in winter - perioral dermatitis being one, hormonal breakouts are now mercifully rare, and overall I have nothing to really complain about.*\n\n*Freckles, a little hyperpigmentation, starting to see a couple of fine lines - expression lines mainly (static wrinkles, with very few at rest), but am starting to see the start of dynamic wrinkles (the dreaded 11's that my dad has in abundance, and I am likely to get from frowning at a computer/phone screen all day!), general ageing concerns (I was starting to see a lack of elasticity and brightness before I started reading up on skincare here), and also a few areas of slightly larger pores.*\n\n\nI was going to get specific but I will just break it down broadly as the list was getting WAYYYY long.  I can specify products if need be.\n\n**Cleansers**: cream, micellar water, argan/coconut oil (for eye makeup and OCM), gel cleanser\n\n**Toner**: Pixi Glow Tonic Glycolic Acid \n\n**Serums**: with copper peptides, niacinamide, vitamin C (with ferulic acid and vit e), antioxidant serum with a mixture of vitamins and CoQ10, hyaluronic acid serum\n\n**Humectants/moisturisers**: niacinamide, glucosamine, capric/caprylic acid, shea butter, retinol containing, jojoba oil/almond oil/apricot kernel oil, and amino acids \n\n **Acids**: Mandelic, lactic, glycolic and a lighter mandelic gel \n\n**SPF**: Chemical - SPF50 broad spectrum, SPF30 with retinol and shea butter and a mineral sunscreen day cream SPF25 with titanium dioxide combined with Hyaluronic acid + pro-xylane 3%\n\n**Night products** retinol (1%), niacinamide (can you tell I love a bit of niacinamide??), capric/caprylic acid, 5% urea, hyaluronic acid serum\n\n\nOK, so ...\n\nTL/DR:  What products/ingredients to use roughly when (i.e. morning or night), how frequently (per week, for example), and in what order to maximise benefits?  \n\nMassive thanks in advance!",

    "body": "Hey all! So firstly - I know it's rosacea, that bit is super obvious. The bit I'm specifically talking about wondering if it's CD is the lower part of my face on my left side (underneath the cheekbone/above the jaw bone) and down my neck, it's also on my chest.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3hvcamfodutd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf8355102164c7d67383c5d6b7ddc4ba91c9c5da\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kuisddeodutd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffeeff9c43b7cefa4bd06220d59920dd7146debd\n\nThis part of my face (lower jaw area on the left) feels completely different. It's dry, itchy, tight, irritated, almost chapped. Actually all of my left side feels chapped and irritated/tight. My right side *feels* absolutely fine and the barrier seems on be healthier on that side as it's less dry/red/chapped (I know it's not great either, but just mentioning that the two sides of the face feel/look very different in person)\n\nFor context, I think my skin barrier is completely broken more so on this left side (stinging with water, dry etc) - it's got progressively worse over the last 6 months with it now spreading to my lower face where I've never had any issues - it's always looked like the right side with it just being on the high points of my cheeks. The right side isn't great but the left side in particular I'm wondering if it has something else going on, on top of the rosacea? Demodex, CD, folliculitis, skin barrier? I have no idea. Maybe not any of these!\n\nThe reason I'm wondering if it's CD is because the super condensed version of my story goes like this;\n\n* Moved from UK to Australia\n* Tap water in our accommodation was crazy high in chlorine (we're not sure if it was actually filtered from the pool it was that strong). It was like showering/washing face in a swimming pool every day for 7 months\n* Skin got progressively worse in that time (started with just being dry and flaky, then slowly developing little red bumps on the left side, then progressing)\n* During that time I was using a tallow soap (didn't realise they were super high pH)\n* So I think I destroyed my barrier with those 2 things and wasn't using a proper moisturiser either (was using apricot kernel oil by itself)\n* Then switched to a different moisturiser but didn't realise it had grapefruit seed extract, which I think on top of rosacea, sensitive skin + compromised barrier I may have reacted to leading to the reaction on my lower jaw? \n\nI just find it weird how my left side has always been the one more effected throughout this timeline.\n\nI went to see a derm for the first time ever yesterday and it was a waste of $400 AUD and 30 minutes. She just did not care. Among other things, I emphasised that I'd like it tested as I wasn't sure if there was an infection or folliculitis going on with it spreading down my neck and chest. I'm currently pregnant so skin *health* is my number one priority for me and baby and I just wanted to be 100% sure, not just based on what she saw as I've heard sometimes rosacea can look similar to other things. She kept saying it's rosacea and wouldn't test (but I'm not convinced you can get rosacea bumps on your chest? I could be wrong here), and suggested laser. \n\nSurely laser on a super broken skin barrier isn't healthy? And then proceeded to put a tinted sunscreen on my (broken, irritated, reactive) skin without patch testing, and said \"well at least we've covered it up now!\" She seemed to care more about aesthetics than health, and recommended a moisturiser/cleanser with witch hazel and 20% azelaic acid.\n\nAnyway, I'm hesitant to try a derm again as we don't have that money to spend. But I do care about whether there is something underlying going on - whether CD, infection, anything else - so I know I'm treating the right thing and not posing harm to me or baby.\n\nI'm currently using only Vanicream Cleanser in the evening to keep it clean and no moisturiser as I'm still trying to find one that agrees with my skin. It doesn't seem to be improving by itself so I don't know what to do from here. Is this something a GP can test? Should I just be using a low irritant moisturiser? I'm lost! Thank you <3 ",

        "body": "All os the “other” options you mentioned are actually derived from rosacea. Demodex overgrowth, dermatitis, skin barrier problems… I’m going to explain why. \n\n- Demodex : they’re tiny mites that feed off sebum (aka oil) and dead skin cells. And since the rosacea is often followed by overproduction of sebum, it’s common to see a greater amount of these mites. They usually cause comedons (white heads), but sometimes they can cause irritation too.\n- Contact Dermatitis: rosacea skin is prone to dermatitis simply because of the fact that your blood vessels are prone to irritation and are easily triggered by external factors.\n- skin barrier : rosacea skin has weaker skin barrier bc of the inflammation present on the blood vessels.\n\n\nSo basically :\n\nRosacea > oil production > demodex \n \nRosacea > inflammatory response of the capillaries > dermatitis \n\nRosacea > inflammatory response of the capillaries > weak skin barrier \n\nHope this helps! :)",

From what I can tell by the ingredients it's nothing but various oils and a couple clays. No lye or other chemicals I think of as being soap. Based on the ingredients I'd expect an oily gritty mess, but it froths up with a silky foam and rinses squeaky clean. I just don't understand how. Is it the clays? Normally I'd assume hidden ingredients, but the brand has a pretty solid reputation with the beardos.\n\nHonest Amish Beard and Body Slick:\n\nOlive Pomace Oil, Coconut Oil, Palm Fruit Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil\\*, Apricot Kernel Oil, Castor Oil\\*, White Kaolin Clay, Yellow French Clay, Eucalyptus Globulus Essential Oil, Clove Bud Essential Oil, and Cinnamon Leaf Essential Oil\\*.  \n\\* = Certified Organic Oils\n\n\"Our Slick Soap has a base of olive oil pomace, palm, coconut, apricot kernel, and castor mixed with french yellow clay. The result is a cleansing bar with the spiced scent that our 'Slick' customers love. This soap also offers the healing and fragrant properties of eucalyptus, cinnamon, and clove.  \nEvery single bar of soap we make has a different blend and ratio of oils in it.

This company seems to have done a weird and somewhat deceptive combination of these two: they listed the inputs but didn't list the lye.  A lot of companies will do this if they're emphasizing how natural the product is, because listing oils sounds less scary to someone who doesn't have any chemistry knowledge than Sodium Olivate, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palmate, etc. which is how they should be listed there if they don't include the lye.\n\nIt's a bit ironic that a company with the word Honest in its name would do this!",

LA is an AHA and [they are known to photosensitize](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/ingredients/ucm107940.htm) and be harsher than others. Retinol (retinyl palmitate) is a potent resurfacer and anti-age. I'd recommend you to either start with something a little milder or try something with PHA/LHA/BHA. Search here on reddit some suggestions of chemical exfoliants for rosacea (I use CosRX's BHA). If you're willing to try this one, wear sunscreen everyday.\n\nThe second one has Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid). Some people claim it helps treat redness because it's anti-inflammatory. I was not fortunate trying any kind of vitamin c, but i think that's just me. The problem here, in this formula, is [the orange extract](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/plant-extracts/citrus-aurantium-extract.html).\n\nThe No BS hyaluronic cream looks fine. But, as a pro tip, try to look for harsh ingredients in [EWG database](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) or analyzing in in [COSDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php).\n\nHope this helps! :)",

And why vitamin C in a hair product? If it's L-Ascorbic Acid, you should know it's very fickle to work with, and while it's worth if for a leave-on face serum because it has so much benefit for skin, it seems a lot of work for hair. And if you're only using L-AA at 1%, personally I think you might as well not bother with it at all. It would save you a lot of trouble.\n- Why seeds in a leave-in product, plus it's not supposed to exfoliate? I've heard fenugreek is good for hair, but as a rince-off mask (paste) or rince water (soak in water and strain out the seed to just use the water). Never seen the whole seeds used.\n- Are the tea tree, peppermint, lavendar and oregano *essential* oils? That seems like a lot of essential oils...\n- Pretty sure Germall Plus must be used at 0.5%\n\n\n**EDIT**: a quick search on what is probably THE best diy blog yields [a couple of leave-on conditionner recipes](http://swiftcraftymonkey.blogspot.ca/2010/06/conditioners-leave-in-conditioners.html). I gotta say, the basic one seems a **lot** more simple then the general direction of your formula.

It seems to be pretty similar to a number of other beeswax lip balm recipes I've found.\n\nHowever, I want to modify it a bit. I don't want to include peppermint oil - it burns like hell if my lips are cracked or badly bitten and I'm worried that it may dry my lips out even more. I don't want to add any essential oils until I get the basic recipe ironed out, though I'm contemplating rosehip oil once I figure it all out since I've heard it is very good for damaged skin.\n\nI also want to add cocoa and/or shea butter to the mix, since both seem to generally do good things for my skin. \n\nI've also considered using apricot kernel oil instead of coconut - though mainly because my favorite bought lip balm (Lush's Lip Service) uses that, and because it's a liquid at room temperature so I'm guessing that will make for a softer balm overall. Am I right in thinking that? Is there a better oil to use for this mix?\n\nI'm also wondering - what sort of preservatives would I need for a mix like this? Do I need any emulsifiers to get the beeswax to blend in? Is there anything else I need to do to make sure this balm is useable and make sure it has a reasonably good shelf life? ",

Cocoa butter is a bit thicker than Shea or mango butter or coconut oil so I take that into account with an ever so slight adjustment, the liquid oils are all treated equally.

Had a bout of hormonal acne due to birth control in my early 20s, and have had a skincare routine that works for me since then. I have gotten sorta lazy with it in recent years, but this seems like an oddly specific place to be breaking out. My nose crease has been consistently really dry feeling, flakey and frequently breaking out for the last couple of months. It’s mostly the left side, but it’s happening on the right side to a lesser extent as well. Here’s my routine:\n\nApricot kernel oil on a moist cotton pad to remove makeup and dirt\nCetaphil gentle skin cleanser\nInnisfree green tea balancing skin\nInnisfree green tea balancing lotion \n\nSuper simple, but has worked for me for a long time. The only part that changes from time to time is the cleanser, but I haven’t changed it in a long while. I did drop the apricot kernel oil though for the last like…8-10 months maybe? It’s been a while anyway, and I just dropped it out of laziness. I reintroduced it this week since I’ve been struggling with my nose.\n\nI’m wondering if anyone has advice for what generally causes breakouts in this area and products you can recommend? I have really sensitive skin. Most products break me out, so the ones I use are basically my safe products and I’m not sure where to start with introducing something new! Would a clay mask be beneficial? \n\nI sleep on my left side, so I don’t think it would be my pillowcase (but sometimes I do have my face buried in a stuffed animal or something). I haven’t changed my laundry detergent recently either.\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thank you!",

Idk if I have locs forever but I do feel like as a 21 year old, I want to see how it appears on me and go thru that journey.\n\nI made an appointment last month for 01/02/2023 and parents dk at all esp since I'm black, AFAB (closeted Queer Demigirlflux on the Non Binary Spectrum) and they have a huge stigma that locs are dirty and vice versa. I will wash my hair after a week and half since I learn from y'all clean hair and scalp = growth, I already purchased Dr. Bronners Soap for the wash along with a shampoo scalp brush to massage the scalp. Then after that to bring moisture back into my hair and not let it be stiff and dry, I will use Locsanity Daily Moisturizer and finally with a spray bottle mixing water, lion locs rose water and Baja basics rose water together to spray alternative to the Locsanity.\n\nCurrently on my Amazon Cart, I got Jamaican Mango & Lime Vitamin A,D & E Castor Oil, JM&L Eucalyptus Castor Oil, Tea Tree Essential oil by Fiora Essentials, Unscented Organic Blend of Olive, Almond, Jojoba, Grape Seed, Sunflower, and Vitamin E oil by Ancient Greek Remedy Store and Finally Naissance Certified Organic Apricot Kernel Oil. I would be mixing the 5 oils with either water or rose water and spray it weekly but idk yet and will wait to see if my hair feels moisture from just the rose water & Locsanity especially since I learnt that locs you don't need much in your hair to avoid build up beyond washing, and moisture in your hair. \n\nMy goal is to have medium sized locs, Idk the number since everyone is different and I am still deciding which pattern should I request to get. I feel like diamond and two strain would be nice but when I get to my appointment I ask her what is her strongest methods since I rather do something like comb coils and square pattern and she does it wonderful then mediocre on my preferences. I just want locs that I be able to put my hair up or down and if I got time do basic styles, that's one of the main reasons I always used done box braids since I don't have time or patience to figure out my natural hair. I'm hoping with locs, I be able to develop a different form of patience and being able to trust the process for it to loc and grow.\n\nI'm scared and nervous but I can't wait to start my journey soon, the community has been a huge influence to me starting and I want to thank each of you for rocking your locs and constantly give advice to the youngsters like myself. Thank you once again, and I can't wait to update y'all soon.\n\n\nAlso I put in a random tag bc reddit told me I couldn't post without a tag, if I had to put a question then it would be, \"Any advice for a 4c hair starting their loc journey after years of back to back box braids?\" And also \"How to overcome bias and stigma in wanting to have locs from other people?\"",

Comb coils are more delicate and prone to unraveling and people may not know how to fix them themselves if they unravel while washing.\n\nLocs don't need a lot of different products. You could save your money on some of those things. Make sure you dilute your essential oils so you don't give your scalp chemical burns. Some people say Dr bronners gives them buildup in hard water. You should also dilute Dr bronners. I found that using a clarifying shampoo weekly when I don't put much in my hair was rough on my scalp, but I do have very sensitive skin.\n\nIf you don't already use all of those  oils and products to maintain your braids, you might be overcomplicating your routine. Too much oil can also cause fungal infections for those who are prone to them. But, if it has been working for you already with no issues, you can continue.",

I love Shea butter so I’ve been using it (100%, creamy white unrefined), and mixing in a bit of jojoba oil with apricot kernel oil or sweet almond oil. \nI love the results so far but it is a bit greasy and I worry it could be off putting to other people. \nHas anyone had good results with mixing clay into lotions to absorb some of the greasiness? If so, do you mind recommending what worked for you? If not, do you have any other recommendations that could help with the greasiness? Thanks for your help!",

    "body": "Yo, brothers! It's so important to remember that if you’re trying to set the stage for the fastest, fullest, healthiest growth, the first step is reducing inflammation. For folks with sensitive skin, that can be tougher than it is for others, so I wanted to write this short guide for you. A brother asked about this on the sub yesterday, and most of this info was there, but I thought it deserved its own post in case someone needs it down the road. Let’s dive in.\n\nFirst off, sensitive skin can be a challenge, but it’s super manageable once you know what to look for. The beard care market is full of products that claim to work miracles, but a lot of them are downright awful for sensitive skin. Here’s what you need to know to find products that actually help rather than hurt. Here's a few red flags to watch for!\n\n**Understand the oils**\n\nNot all oils are created equal, especially for sensitive skin. The big thing to look for is the oil's comedogenic rating. This tells you how likely an oil is to clog your pores. For sensitive skin, stick with oils that have a rating of 2 or lower. Anything below 1 is even better and is classified as \"non-comedogenic\". That’s the gold standard. Clogging your pores can lead to irritation, inflammation, and even breakouts, which is the exact opposite of what you want when trying to grow a healthy beard. You can look these up with a quick Google search, but here's some common ones. \n\n**Hemp Seed Oil** – 0,2  \n**Argan Oil** – 0.7  \n**Sweet Almond Oil** – 1.7  \n**Jojoba Oil** – 2.6  \n**Grapeseed Oil** – 0.8  \n**Avocado Oil** – 1.9  \n**Castor Oil** – 1.1  \n**Coconut Oil (Unrefined)** – 4.5  \n**Coconut Oil (Fractionated)** – 0.8  \n**Olive Oil** – 2.6  \n**Apricot Kernel Oil** – 1.7  \n**Hazelnut Oil** – 0.7  \n**Sunflower Oil** – 0.3  \n**Macadamia Nut Oil** – 2.1  \n**Pumpkin Seed Oil** – 2.4  \n**Rice Bran Oil** – 2.1  \n**Rosehip Seed Oil** – 1.5  \n**Baobab Oil** – 1.6  \n**Meadowfoam Seed Oil** – 1.4  \n**Shea Butter (Unrefined)** – 0.4  \n**Shea Butter Oil** – 1.4  \n**Lanolin Oil** – 4.2  \n**Palm Kernel Oil** – 4.1  \n**Wheat Germ Oil** – 5  \n**Emu Oil** – 3.3  \n**Ostrich Oil** – 3.6  \n**Duck Oil** – 4.2\n\nYou can take a quick average of a blend to get a loose idea, but that's the best you can do without knowing the exact ratios a company uses of each oil. Always ask. Any company worth a damn will know the comedogenic rating of their formula off-hand. \n\n**Avoid artificial fragrances**\n\nArtificial fragrances are one of the worst offenders for sensitive skin. These are often alcohol-based or packed with synthetic chemicals that can trigger reactions. Common culprits like linalool and limonene are found in tons of mass-market products. You want to see \"No Artificial Fragrances\" on the label. Essential oils are usually a better choice, but even those need to be used carefully. Regulation in the essential oil world is basically nonexistent, and there’s a ton of misinformation out there. For example, most don't know that there are only 176 recognized essential oils, and of those, only about 102 are commonly used in scenting. So if someone’s telling you they’ve got \"leather\", \"tobacco\", or \"mahogany\" essential oil, that’s nonsense. Those aren’t essential oils. They might be fragrance oils derived from natural absolutes (which is a whole thing). but they are more likely artificial and made with synthetic chemicals. Either way, avoid them unless you know exactly how they’re made. Even with real essential oils, concentration matters. Sensitive skin can’t handle high doses. The safe level for essential oils in a beard product is about 1.75% or less. Anything more can lead to major reactions or even photosensitivity.\n\n**Choose the right cleanser**\n\nSensitive skin thrives in a balanced ecosystem. That means finding a pH-balanced beard wash and using it as necessary. Always follow up with a good, non-comedogenic oil to calm the skin and keep inflammation under control. Harsh soaps or products with sulfates will strip your beard and the skin beneath it of natural oils, leaving everything dry and irritated. That’s a fast track to more inflammation and slower growth, especially for dudes with sensitive skin. Stick to gentle cleansers designed specifically for beards.\n\nSensitive skin might take a little more effort, but always worth it to grow a great beard. Employ these tools and let that beard rip, y'all. ",

I got like 17 down votes in a just the few minutes it took me to realize my mistake and a few people commented on it saying things that totally embarrassed me. So I'm just going to give you guys a description since I haven't figured out Imgur yet. And I'm just using my phone and the app confuses me.\n\nOkay this is going to be long but here is all the info I can think of--\n\nBackground: I'm 22/f. Started getting horrible acne durning puberty. Never really got cystic acne but more so lots of white heads, blackheads, clogged pores, uneven skin tone, etc. It was bad for years but my parents never took me to see a dermatologist. I spent years caking on foundation making everything so much worse. Birth control didn't help. Fast forward now. The past few years I got really into natural skincare. My acne has improved a lot but I can't get rid the sebaceous filaments (which is like every pore on my face! It's the worst on my nose and chin) I pick a lot, because I can't help it. I have to exfoliate intensely every day or else my face is really rough. My skin has always been really bad when I'm using harsh products or soaps. I had a baby. Skin got a little worse throughout pregnancy. Now my skin is doing a lot better (my baby is 5 months old) don't have a lot of acne, but my pores and skin texture is a nightmare.\n\nCurrent things I use on my face: apricot kernel oil. Lush black angels scrub. Sometimes Sophyto multivitamin facial serum. Homemade moisturizer (various butters, oils, beeswax, essential oils; see below) I don't really have a routine and I'm looking to get one. I gave up I guess. \nCurrently taking Garden of Life organics pre natal vitamins. And a type of kelp for extra iodine. When I can remember! Wanting to commit to drinking green tea everyday or taking green tea supplements. \n\nThings I have in my house: (All organic) aloe Vera gel, rose hip oil, apricot kernel oil, avocado oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, olive oil, coconut oil, liquid non gmo vit E, vegetable glycerine, cocoa butter, Shea butter, tons of essential oils and herbs, bentonite clay, activated charcoal, beeswax...really the list is too long, I have everything I need to make salves. I make my own natural makeup and moisturizers. I get all my supplies from MountainRoseHerbs.com. (My makeup is about SPF 15, I use zinc oxide in my recipe) \n\nI'm willing to try new things here. Even if the products are not natural. Something gentile with a good Ph. Or something I already have here at home and suggestions on a routine. \n\nI am exclusively breast feeding and plan to do so for at least another year. I am really open to taking medication (even have considered accutane, even though the risks scare me) but I can not take any medication until I am done breastfeeding. My husband and I may also decide to have another baby then, so who knows when I would be able to try medications. Need to figure out another way!\n\nI will post photos when I figure out how to.\nThanks for reading this!\n\n\n\n",

I've read that BHA in large amounts isn't a great idea for breastfeeding women - but you should be fine if you keep it at 2% & under. Since I'm just a rando on the internet & not a doctor, you may want to triple check with yours to make sure that is correct. :) If I were in your shoes, I'd consider giving these a try before giving medication a shot. (Only because of your plans to breastfeed for the next year & possibly having another baby - it might be easier to do topical treatments more consistently!) \n\nWhen I first stared tackling them, I relied heavily [this technique](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/03/28/how-to-shrink-pores-temporarily-plus-3-pore-myths/) to really loosen up my SFs. I have never felt the little grains she refers to, but it really did help minimize the look of them. I used to do it about once a week, and now I basically do it \"as needed\". \n\nHopefully this helps! :) Keep us updated!!",

I typically wash with cream cleansers but after reading through this subreddit decided to try OCM. I bought apricot kernel oil and started using OCM nightly. After a few nights my face started getting red and stinging when I put my regular moisturizer on afterwards and now I have visible dry patches on my cheeks. My question is, is OCM only good for oily skin? Or should I be using a different oil? or adjust my technique in other ways?\n\nHere's what I do: 1)Wash hands with soap and water then dry hands 2)apply oil on dry skin and rub for a couple minutes 3)remove with a warm wash cloth-I pat the washcloth and try not to rub too much 3)pay dry with towel 4)apply a few drops of oil from melvita 5)apply moisturizer.",

Yes, there are quite a few essential oils that are extremely toxic to pets (especially cats!) but I think that any tiny bit of watered down essential oil in the soaps and candles BBW sells aren’t enough to cause harm. Full on medical grade essential oils and soaps/shampoos made with them are a whole different ballgame. I feel like it’s a marketing ploy for BBW more than anything since essential oils are the new thing. I burn their candles all the time and use the hand soaps as well, and have never had any problems with my kitty. I’ve never seen an animal that had toxicity from a BBW candle or soap either. Just keep everything up away from your pet and you should be good :)\n\nEdit: Long day and I just saw you were talking about the plug in: I use those too without any issues.

It's the worst after washing it, but it's not allergy. Maybe it dries out?\n\nSo first I noticed that a hair oil I bought in a shop would ease the symptoms but it had a greasy look in my hair with a strong (but good) smell. Then I made my first oil mixture myself, that is something like this (I kinda eyeballed it):\n- 30ml of apricot kernel oil\n- 10ml of tamaru oil\n- 10ml of black seed oil\n- 15 drops of tea tree oil\n- 15 drops of levander oil\n- 5 drops of vitamin E oil\n\nI absolutely love it, the smell is interesting but I like it, and as long as I use it daily, my scalp is compeltely healthy. I just finished off my first 50ml bottle, and after a week of using it I tried to only use it every 2nd day, and the eczema already started returning in some spots. I feel like I have to use it daily to keep up with the results but I went long enough without washing that my scalp would normally start its healing process not the opposite.\n\nI was wondering if any of you could give me advice, maybe a magic ingredient is missing or something like that. I noticed that the next day after using this, my hair looks like it's freshly washed, it just drinks in all of it, so I probably need something that could help it holding onto the moisture for longer.",

Its often caused by a fungus that grows and irritates in oily and moist areas of the body. The reason its worse right after washing is because your hair is replenishing the oils you stripped from it. The way ive combatted this myself is but thuroughly blow drying my scalp and hair after showering and brushing the oils through my hair. Idk how well youll be able to accomplish this with dreads but i know that leaving your hair to air dry causes the damnness to linger too long, it can cause bacteria to multiply quickly, immune response to the bacteria production, the dampness can actually also damage your skin because just like you should let a cut get fresh air your scalp skin will be comes tender and gooey and tear easily when itching or styling leading to more flaky dry crusty even oozy patches.",

I don't smoke, drink, or do any recreational drugs, though I am on about four psychiatric meds.\n\nI've been lurking here for about a month and it's already helped a lot with my compulsive picking. I learned about chemical exfoliants for the first time! Right now I'm just using Stridex as a BHA, but I'd really like to step up my game in that area. I'm willing to spend money, but I like to do a lot of research first.\n\n**Skin type**: I can't quite tell. I'm very pale, which I love. A little tight after cleansing, but the rest of the day it's normal, maybe a little oily. Thoughts?\n\n**Skin concerns**: \n\n* Are these spider veins? I've had them since birth. Once the school nurse accused me of having chicken pox! I hate them. What can I do?\n\n* Sporadic acne. I've been a terrible picker all my life. This sub has really helped with that! Hydrocolloid bandages blow my mind. I'm not too freaked about pimples right now.\n\n* Slight scarring from that lifetime of picking. You can't really see it in the pics but it's there. The scars are mostly roundish and shallow, some a bit deeper than others. Can I do anything about them? Will it involve lasers?\n\n* Closed comedones! Those jerks have moved in on my chin and nothing I do well get them out. Help! (The big black dot isn't a blackhead, it's from a piercing.)\n\n**PM**:\n\nOCM with sweet almond or apricot kernel oil.   \nCeraVe cleanser (normal kind).   \nStridex red-box.   \n(Wait 30 minutes.).   \nCeraVe in the tub.   \nVaseline.   \n\n**AM**: \n\nUsually just warm water, then CeraVe in the tub. **I haven't bought sunscreen yet!** Don't hate me. I want to buy the best one but I can't figure out what it is. Biore? That other MD one everyone loves (~~I forget its name~~ Elta)?\n\nI guess that's it.

It's just people poisoning themselves with cyanide while letting their cancer progress. \n\n\"i bought the apricot kernels after reading about the health benefits apricot kernels have. The apricot kernels from Hunza Gold are great, fresh and pleasant to eat. they are bitter but not that bitter as i thought they may be. the recommended dose is 3 kernels per day, but i eat way more than that. the apricot kernels give me energy and focus, increase my appetite and are very good for my overall health. for freshness i keep apricot kernels in the refrigerator.\"\n\n\"I had a bump on a lymph node along my jawline that hurts when pressed. I also had what looked like premalignant basal cell tumour on my leg. Doctor wanted to do biopsies. I decided to try this. started with 1 seed every hour. still alive after 24 hours so I did 3 seeds every waking hour. Within 3 days the bump disappeared. The basal cell tumour on the skin is taking longer but it's shrinking.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you're referring to the metal or to the Gold Apricot Kernels from the very suitable name from Hunza Gold they're both very precious. I still asking myself why I chose the most expensive one? Its origin.\nThese kernels were recommended to me by a professional massage therapist whom like me suffer of the psoriasis skin disease. Because of Hunza Gold Kernels search at Amazon.com, I ended up bumping into Dr. Adorable Apricot Kernel oil which evidently I bought both the kernels and the oil.\nDr. Adorable says the Apricot kernel oil is good for:\nIdeal for face, hands and body\nUsed to treat chapped lips, diaper rash, dry skin\nPrevents skin disorders such as acne and eczema\nIt reduces skin inflammation and helps in curing several skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis.\n(Can you imagine the hopes I have using the two of them together?) I also use in my hair once a month to calm it down.\nI'm a SuperFoods crazy fan to achieve and keep the good health I have, so as recommended I use 3 kernels per person in my NutriBullet daily shake. I also bought the sweet version of this kernel which is the one I like to eat by itself.\nMy NutriBullet shake is not like anyone's else. I have a list of over 50 items which includes fresh fruits, frozen pulps (because that what I do to the excess of fruits (Pulp 'em) instead of getting a chance to let them spoil. No, I waist nothing.) Over 30 nuts, powders, and seed along with Greek Yogurt and Raw Honey. Some fresh veggies as in carrots, celery, spinach or kale or collard greens, ginger and mint leaves. I also use coconut water instead of water, and some juices from Brazil like the \"Caju (cashew)fruit juice\" and my #1 favorite Passion Fruit. Goya's frozen pulp are now available in California Mexican Produce stores and Safeway.\nI'll tell you one last thing, at 60 years of age there are no medications in my house, how about your? Remember, life is to short so please live it in full, and don't waist it making the wrong choices. Live life drug free. Thank you for having the Gold Nuts. Ana\"\n",

Products that can deliver some hydration while also working their sebum reducing magic have been favorites for me recently (the Peach & Lily Pore Proof Perfecting Clay Mask and Troiareuke Acsen Pore Control Mask come to mind). \n\nOn paper, this offering from Eco Your Skin should have fit the bill. Kaolin Clay, Apricot Kernel Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Centella Asiatia. The various hydrators and just the formulation in general allows this mask to not totally dry down...but almost feel like a cream/gel style product.\n\nOnce on, one of the main things that makes this mask less than ideal for me is the scent. Before all of the hydrating/soothing ingredients comes Peppermint Oil. And while I am not totally against that (or essential oils in general)...the concentration makes the scent rather strong. Each time I used this product I experienced watery eyes just from the “fumes” coming off of this mask lol!\n\nHonestly...I’d be willing to let that go if this mask delivered on its claims to balance oil/sebum production and “detox” pores. But, I really didn't see much in the way of that. The peppermint, tea tree, and centella asiatica did do a bit to offer a cooling/soothing effect...but the results seemed really short-term and did not build on themselves with multiple uses.\n\nIf anything, I found this mask to be a bit drying after removal. Even with the creamy consistency and hydrators in the formulation...this product left my skin feeling like I had used a more intense/harsh clay mask.\n\nNeedless to say this isn't something I will be coming back to. The scent reminded me a lot of some of the tea tree clay masks I used in my youth and it left my skin equally as dry. I really didn't see any benefit to using the Eco Your Skin Deep Pore Benefit Mask and I’m looking forward to removing it from my routine. \n\nI have one more mask from this line to try...and I’m hoping things go better this time around. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Kaolin, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Canola Oil, Polysorbate 80, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Glycosyl Trehalose, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dryopteris Crassirhizoma Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Butylene Glycol, CI 19140, CI 42090\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily $27.00 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/deep-pore-benefit-mask](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/deep-pore-benefit-mask) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqgtmvtoydi51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94b5db7c3801a80f40b3983fe45922d1d27a072c",

    "body": "Eco Your Skin Deep Pore Benefit Mask\n\nThe second of three wash-off style/clay masks that came as part of a set from Peach & Lily...this Deep Pore Benefit Mask from Eco Your Skin was the one of the three that I was most interested in.\n\nAs someone with combination/dehydrated skin...I’m always looking for that balance between clarifying and hydrating when it comes to masks/products in general.\n\nI’ve really been loving clay masks that don't totally dry down or get super stiff. Products that can deliver some hydration while also working their sebum reducing magic have been favorites for me recently (the Peach & Lily Pore Proof Perfecting Clay Mask and Troiareuke Acsen Pore Control Mask come to mind). \n\nOn paper, this offering from Eco Your Skin should have fit the bill. Kaolin Clay, Apricot Kernel Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Centella Asiatia. The various hydrators and just the formulation in general allows this mask to not totally dry down...but almost feel like a cream/gel style product.\n\nOnce on, one of the main things that makes this mask less than ideal for me is the scent. Before all of the hydrating/soothing ingredients comes Peppermint Oil. And while I am not totally against that (or essential oils in general)...the concentration makes the scent rather strong. Each time I used this product I experienced watery eyes just from the “fumes” coming off of this mask lol!\n\nHonestly...I’d be willing to let that go if this mask delivered on its claims to balance oil/sebum production and “detox” pores. But, I really didn't see much in the way of that. The peppermint, tea tree, and centella asiatica did do a bit to offer a cooling/soothing effect...but the results seemed really short-term and did not build on themselves with multiple uses.\n\nIf anything, I found this mask to be a bit drying after removal. Even with the creamy consistency and hydrators in the formulation...this product left my skin feeling like I had used a more intense/harsh clay mask.\n\nNeedless to say this isn't something I will be coming back to. The scent reminded me a lot of some of the tea tree clay masks I used in my youth and it left my skin equally as dry. I really didn't see any benefit to using the Eco Your Skin Deep Pore Benefit Mask and I’m looking forward to removing it from my routine. \n\nI have one more mask from this line to try...and I’m hoping things go better this time around. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Kaolin, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Canola Oil, Polysorbate 80, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Glycosyl Trehalose, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dryopteris Crassirhizoma Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Butylene Glycol, CI 19140, CI 42090\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily $27.00 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/deep-pore-benefit-mask](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/deep-pore-benefit-mask) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74e163yrydi51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d82ffe82d53d037daaa7abe16161f62653cb6c42",

I looked here and elsewhere how to fix it and put the soap in the cold oven with the light on overnight. The glycerin has reabsorbed but you can still see where the spots were and I'd like to avoid this next time!\n\nMy 16oz recipe is: 8.0 oz rice bran oil, 3.20 oz coconut oil, 2.4 oz apricot kernel oil, 1.12 oz  sweet almond oil, 0.64 oz castor oil, 0.64 oz shea butter\n\n8% superfat, 6.08 oz distilled water and 2.12 oz sodium hydroxide. Lye water 88F, oils 77F. Micas (Mad Micas) added at 0.25 tsp premixed in 0.5 tbsp oil to 9.5 oz batter (supernova) and 0.5 tsp premixed in 0.5 tbsp oil to 9.5 oz (3 olive martini). 6 oz remaining batter had no mica. No titanium dioxide.\n\nPlaced on heating pad for 30 mins on medium with a cardboard box over the top. I checked on the soap a couple of hours later and saw the glycerin droplets. \n\nI used 1oz of Nature's Garden hot baked apple pie. I realized later that they recommend 0.8oz (5%). I was still below IFRA maximum (I checked the SDS).\n\nI'm also in Florida where it is more humid than the last times I made this combo (both in May, both 16oz batches). Maybe a fan or dehumidifier would help? Maybe it was the fragrance and the superfatting? The last two times I made this recipe, I used 0.5 oz of Brambleberry trial size fragrance oils.\n\nI'll happily take any advice on how to prevent this happening in the future please.\n\nThank you! I'm learning something everytime I make soap and I love it.",

        "body": "The likely reason for the liquid droplets is your soap overheated. Your ingredient temps started out fairly cool, but you then warmed the molded soap with a heating pad on medium and also covered the soap to keep the heat in. I don't heat/insulate my soap to this extent unless I'm making soap in the coldest part of an Iowa winter. \n\nUse gloves if you handle this soap until the droplets reabsorb or dry out. The liquid is caustic (high pH) and can be damaging to your skin. \n\nYour lye concentration is about 26% and that's a lot of water for this type of recipe and the cold-process method you used. A high water content also makes it more likely the soap will overheat. \n\nMy guess is you're using \"water as % of oils\" to calculate the water amount. My suggestion is to use either lye concentration or water:lye ratio. These two settings are mathematically the same; they just look different. Try this recipe at 33% lye concentration (2:1 water:lye ratio) and see if that helps. \n\nThis soap is low in palmitic and stearic acids, so it's probably not going to last long in the bath, even after a generous cure time. This may or may not bother you. But if it does, increase the amount of shea or add other fats that are rich in palmitic and stearic acids.",

Fairly recent lurker, first-time poster.\n\nAfter years in the try-every-product cycle, I’ve realized my skin is happiest with a simple, active-minimal routine, and I’ve been toying with the idea of formulating my own skincare for some time. I am very new to cosmetic chemistry, and I am someone with a tendency towards both obsessive research and *do-it-right-nowitis*— I’m extremely aware of how much I don’t know, and extremely cautious as a result, but also extremely eager to get mixing. I want to start with what seem like pretty foolproof projects: face oil and body butter. (Not foolproof in the sense of “so easy to get to a final product I’m happy with,” but rather not relying on an immense amount of formulation know-how.)\n\nI know that face oils are kind of a “whatever you want them to be” thing, and it feels perhaps inappropriate to seek advice on something that I could safely trial-and-error, but if you’ll indulge me, I’d just like a bit of feedback based on my skin type. I’m 34F, dry skin, compromised barrier (years of sun damage, persistent stress/poor sleep), enlarged pores, very prone to dehydration and dullness, occasional hormonal acne. I experience mild, intermittent eczema (mostly in my nose/mouth/chin area, occasionally at the corners of my eyes) but am not highly sensitive outside of those areas/episodes.\n\nI’d like to address the dryness (with the understanding that I need a humectant product under the oil in addition), promote healing/barrier health, and (much lower priority) promote radiance and improved skin tone, without clogging my pores. What I’m currently thinking is:\n\n>40% apricot kernel oil  \n40% sunflower seed oil  \n10% prickly pear seed oil  \n10% rose hip seed oil  \n\nI’m primarily looking for thoughts on whether these components in this ratio will address my concerns; if there’s an oil I should consider adding/substituting; if there are any special concerns regarding shelf life; etc. But any and all feedback is welcome! (Would especially love to hear about similar formulas you’ve tried.) Thanks very much for your time in reading this far (I don’t know how this simple question turned into such a long post!) and responding, if you feel compelled to.\n\nNB I don’t expect the proposed formula to be heavy, but I feel it’s worth mentioning that I’ve used oil as my primary moisturizer before (jojoba, marula, and argan at various times) and don’t mind a bit of sheen/oily feel.",

I oftentimes see that people are able to plane/bevel just a couple days after cutting, and that hasn’t been the case for us. \n\nSorry for the newb question! I am a newb at this after all.

        "body": "The softness of soap is highly dependent on the recipe used and can be caused by quite a few things. Note that some soaps can take quite a while to harden up, so it's not necessarily abnormal to have soft soap.\n\n1 reason for soft soap is using too many \"soft\" oils. I don't think this is your problem since more than half of your oils are \"hard\".\n\nAnother reason would be too much water/other liquids (milks, fragrances, etc). How did you use your goat's milk? Did you subtract some water from your lye solution and replace it with the milk? You also need to consider that goat's milk has a higher fat content, so it would be a good idea to lower your superfat to accommodate for this. If my superfat is normally 5%, I tend to lower it to 2-3% if using milks (coconut milk, goat's milk, etc). There is a way to calculate how much to adjust your superfat by, you should be able to google how to. I remember finding a blog that went into the math step by step.",

Your lye solution is decent...you could use less goat's milk to lower your water amount (I know it's not water, but goat milk counts as your water). I would try a 33% lye concentration or higher to see if that helps. \n\nOtherwise, if your goat's milk is high fat, it could be bumping your superfat up enough to soften the loaf. If you use a higher lye solution, and therefore less milk, you can leave the superfat alone to keep it to one change at a time. If you want to keep your lye solution strength the same (ergo, the same amount of milk), you could try dropping your superfat a couple percents to see if that helps since you are using full milk to replace water. \n\nAlso, add some sodium lactate to help with early days firming up. Won't make the bar harder long term, but helps it firm up the first days.",

But I was possibly too overkeen. :( My skin is going a bit gross? At first I thought it was just purging (and I think it was then) but I think I didn't react well to the Tosowoong Pure Propolis Sheet mask, which I'm super bummed about. I actually think the sf on my nose has gotten worse recently and there are small bumps all over my face. Argh. \n\nMy skin is normally good everywhere but the tzone area - I have closed comedones on my forehead and sf on my nose. I've had some hormonal acne few a few months as a result of coming off BC but I'm back on it now so hopefully that will resolve itself.\n\nThis is my current routine, built up over about 5 weeks:\n\n\n**AM**\n\n- Innisfree Bija Anti-Trouble Gel Cleanser/water/raw honey\n\n- Thaylers aloe vera witch hazel\n\n- Paula's Choice Clear Regular strength anti-redness exfoliating solution 2%\nOR\nCosRx AHA Whitehead Power Liquid (alternate days)\n- Spritz of rose water\n- Mizon Black snail AIO\n- Biore Perfect Milk\n\n\n**PM** \n\n- Cleanse with apricot kernel oil\n\n- Innisfree Bija Anti-Trouble Gel Cleanser\n\n- Thaylers aloe vera witch hazel\n\n- Spritz of rose water\n\n- Mizon Black snail AIO\n\n- Mizon White sleeping pack\n\n\n\nI'm fairly confident that the Innisfree cleanser, Thaylers witch hazel and the Mizon black AIO are okay as I've been using them all for a few weeks and my skin was okay prior to last week. I've also been using the PC 2% for a few weeks and I think that was just causing purging. BUT I have the CosRx BHA Power Liquid in my cupboard which I want to transition over to anyway.\n\nI think the majority of my skincare issues have started since I began the CosRX AHA but I'm not sure if this is due to the product itself, over exfoliating or because of the Tosowoong Pure Propolis Sheet mask I used the other day (which I could immediately tell didn't agree with me).\n\n**Products I have waiting in the cupboard to be tested/used:**\n\n- Banila co. Clean it Zero purity cleanser\n- CosRx BHA Power Liquid\n- CosRX snail mucin essence\n- LHJ tea tree essence\n- CosRX honey ceramide cream\n- Mamonde rose honey sleeping pack\n- TCFS Pumpkin sleeping pack\n\nRegarding sunscreen, I began using the Biore a few days ago, prior to that I was using Bioderma Photomax but I really didn't like how greasy and heavy it felt on my skin.\n\nPlease can someone help me decide whether/how much I need to scale back and how to start introducing things? :(\n\n(Sorry for the really long post)\n",

    "body": "New to soap making. Hoping someone can help answer some of these questions.\n\nThis is for cold process soap. I apologize if these questions have really obvious answers, but I'm getting some conflicting information from Google and now I’m even more confused than when I started.\n\nI used these ingredients, not necessarily in this order: coconut oil, macadamia nut oil, avocado oil, sweet almond oil, apricot kernel oil, castor oil, sodium hydroxide, mango seed butter, shea butter, cocoa butter, fragrance, pigments.\n\nSuperfat was 5% and the water/lye ratio was 2.7:1.\n\nSupplies: I used pyrex bowls, an immersion blender, an 8 cavity silicone mold, and silicone stirring tools.\n\nI let it sit for 48 hours in the molds before removing them. I put them on a paper plate with a paper towel over them and let them sit in my laundry room for about 4 1/2 weeks. My batch produced a creamy lather and was good in terms of hardness… but it doesn’t look good. It has holes (like swiss cheese), it turned brown, and it leaves my skin feeling kind of tight.\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\n*Is the discoloration due to the ingredients, fragrance, or the actual process? If it’s an ingredients issue, which ones can cause this?\n\n*What could have caused the holes? They were only on the bottom when I took them out of the molds.\n\n*I’m not sure how much pigment I should be using per pound of soap. In the same first batch I used about 1/4 tsp pigment mixed with a tsp of glycerin to create a swirl and then added the mixture to about a 1/3 of the batter. The color keeps rubbing off in chunks on my skin. How much pigment should I be using to color an entire pound of soap versus a small amount to create a swirl? I’ve been using TKB’s soapberry pigments.\n\n*I don’t have a loaf mold. I’m using an 8 bar silicone mold. I started pouring my soap into the molds once I could see trails on the top of the batter. By the time I reached the end, the soap had started to get too thick and it made the top too lumpy/stringy. Can I reheat this on the stove to thin it out again? Or is this a no no?\n\n*Which oils would be best for someone who needs something super moisturizing? I’m trying to make Christmas gifts and my SIL has pretty bad eczema. Is there a reliable chart somewhere that details what each oil brings to the table in a soap?\n\n*How many oils should or shouldn’t I be using in a batch of soap? I used about six different oils in this batch (coconut, macadamia, avocado, sweet almond, apricot kernel, and castor). I don’t know why I used so many. It seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\n*If there’s soda ash on my soap, does that mean I’m doing something wrong or is this just part of the process?\n\n\nSorry for the length and all the questions, but I appreciate any answers or advice you guys might have!

        "body": "* The discolouration could be from vanilla in the scent.\n\n\n* Did you tap the mold on your bench after you poured the batter in? This is to get the soap to settle into all the nooks and crannies of the mold and prevent air bubbles like what you've found.\n\n\n* I usually just \"eyeball\" the colourants, so I'm not sure on the ideal amount. Also, you can get these little battery powered coffee frothers (IKEA sell them for $2-3) and they are ideal for mixing up the powdered colourants into the carrier oil (I usually mix them with sweet Almond, but any liquid oil will work). Clay I disperse in to distilled water. Whizzing up the colourants with the little frothers gets rid of any lumps of colour, which could be what's causing your problem.\n\n\n* Don't know about reheating it, sorry. We just have to work quickly, as once the lye hits the oil we're on a time limit.\n\n\n* If you Google \"what do different oils do in soap\" you'll find a few websites have good information on it. Basically, coconut oil lathers up like a demon, but is drying, so you might want to limit this to 20%. Olive oil is gentle, but doesn't lather up much, etc.\n\n\n* I personally don't use that many oils in soap. The macadamia, avocado, sweet almond, apricot kernel oils are considered \"luxury\" oils, that I think most people tend to limit to around 10% of their total oils, because they can get quite expensive. Usually, when I work out a recipe, I'll have three things that don't change, they are 20% coconut oil, 5% castor oil and 5-10% of a butter. This makes up 30-35% of the recipe. The rest of it, I'll usually use olive oil, sustainable palm oil and rice bran oil. I like to use a food grade olive oil from the supermarket, I buy it in 4L tins. It's the lightest coloured and mildest tasting one I can find. It's great for soapmaking and good on a salad too.\n\n\n* Soda ash can be prevented on the top of your soap by giving it a light spray with 99% isopropyl alcohol (I got mine at a hardware store). If it's still occuring, or is down the sides of the soap too, you could be mixing your oils and lye together when they are too cool.\n\n\nHope this helps!",

What fragrance did you use? A photo here would be helpful, as holes can be from something simple like air bubbles, or from something complex, like overheating, separation, or lye heaviness. \n\nHow much SF did you do?

They were only on the bottom when I took them out of the molds.\n\nTry tapping your mold on the table right after pouring to force air pockets to the surface. You could also pour your mix at the full emulsion stage rather than waiting for a heavy trace.\n\n\nI don’t have a loaf mold. I’m using an 8 bar silicone mold.

Is there a reliable chart somewhere that details what each oil brings to the table in a soap?\n\nA chart in .pdf format can be found at...\nwww.naturesgardencandles.com/mas_assets/theme/ngc/pdf/soapoils.pdf\n\n\nHow many oils should or shouldn’t I be using in a batch of soap?

It can be avoided by following the advice of the other posts. I would just like to add that I combat mine buy just adding 2% beeswax to my recipe. Add it to your soap calculator though. Or you could wash the ash off with warm water.",

        "body": "Pre-shave: Either one will work, but for me at least the only pre-shave needed is to wash my face in the shower. I think people who use a specific pre-shave treatment are in the minority. That's not to say it won't improve the quality of your shave, just that it isn't a given.\n\nBrush: The Ecotools kabuki can make lather, but it isn't really a shaving brush. Get an Omega. The only question is which one - they make dozens. Some are fantastic, some are pretty terrible, and some are in between. I recommend an S-Brush synthetic (not a Hi-Brush and **definitely** not Syntex) or a boar (I like the 20102). Be very cautious buying Omega brushes on Amazon - the descriptions are often incomplete or misleading and many of the prices are way too high.\n\nMystic Water is good soap. There are plenty of other great artisan makers out there, so you have tons of options, but that's a good one.\n\nThe EJ razor is decent, but that plastic handle can get to looking pretty crappy pretty quickly. It's also susceptible to cracking. If you're buying on Amazon, check out the \"Kelvin\" razor. Also consider the Parker 24c / 26c (the only difference is the handle color) and the Maggard MR-series razors.\n\nPersonally, I like [this kit](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product/budget-starter-kit/). It has everything you need and nothing you don't. I'd get the MR1, the S10065, and one of the Maggard Razors artisan soaps.",

        "body": "Looks good to me. If boar, wet knot well before you shower, then let wet brush sit. It will be ready when shower's done. Give it a week or two of use before judging performance: sometimes new boar brushes will not hold lather well for the first 3-4 uses. (Practice lathers are a good idea, whether boar or synthetic).\n\nThe soap is quite good---I used it just this morning. I find loading the brush goes well if I start with a damp brush, brush the soap briskly and firmly, and add a small amount of water a couple of times as I load, working that into the brush.\n\nParker 24C is an excellent razor. Try 3-4 brands from your sampler pack and then use the best of those exclusively for a couple of months. (To stick to the same brand for two months, you will have to buy a couple of packs of that brand so that you can replace blades as they become dull in use.) By keeping the brand of blade constant, variation from shave to shave is (probably) due to prep and technique, so you can focus more on perfecting those by not changing the razor or brand of blade. Also, after two months, you'll *really* know what that brand of blade feels like so when you try a new brand the differences are highlighted.  \n\nAfter the two months, start exploring: every 4-8 weeks, try one blade of a new brand. If it's better, it becomes your regular brand---the one you use daily. If it's not, return to your regular brand for another 4-8 weeks. This gives you a break (shaving with a brand that's good for you) and also reminds you of what a good shave is like. Every now and then most will stumble upon a brand that takes their shave to a new level. \n\nAftershaves look good, but also take a look at [the aftershave from Bathhouse Soapery](http://bathhousesoap.com/product/organic-aftershave-splash). Ingredients:\n\n>Organic Aloe Leaf Juice, Organic Lavender, Organic Bilberry Extract, Organic Sugar Cane Extract, Organic Sugar Maple Extract, Organic Orange Fruit Extract, Organic Lemon Extract, Organic Cranberry Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Malic Acid (from apples), Tartaric Acid (from grapes), Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Black Willowbark Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\nTake care to avoid [the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/15eqbh/my_so_got_me_a_starter_kit/c7lz76u) when switching to a DE razor.",

Seeing as oils can be very expensive, I'm hoping I could get some specific advice/help/info before I go out there and drop lots of dough (as I have a propensity to do).\n\nI have never been consistent in facial care and I'm looking to change that. I think I have combination skin as my forehead and skin on my inner cheeks can get very dry and even flaky near my eyebrows but I often can go without moisturizing overnight and wake up with decently hydrated feeling skin. I have lots of sebaceous filaments on my nose and often break out throughout my chin with blackheads, pimples and zits.\n\nI picked up some castor oil and want to pick up a good carrier oil to start with. i'm thinking tea tree oil for an EO. I'm very overwhelmed by all the carrier oil choices. Even now with all the research I've done I can barely think of the ones I was thinking of starting with. Apricot kernel oil and sunflower oil, i think. Can anyone help with some suggestions?\n\nAlso does anyone do OCM on their body? If so, how would this work? I get red pimples on my legs and whiteheads on my shoulders, boobs, upper arms and I have experienced these through different detergents and body wash and moisturizer and don't use perfume. Any suggestions?\n\nTLDR: Dry and acneic skin, what carrier oil to start with? Suggestions for OCM for body.\n\nThanks for any and all help!",

        "body": "Hey there! I actually own a tallow-based skincare company myself (Bristol Balms), and I’ve done a deep dive into pretty much every formulation style out there—from pure tallow to emulsified creams like this one.\n\nYou’re right to pause at water in skincare products—water plus oil without a preservative is a recipe for mold and bacteria. But in this case, White Oak Pastures added Optiphen, which is a well-respected, paraben- and formaldehyde-free preservative. It’s specifically designed to keep water-based formulations safe and shelf-stable. So from a formulation standpoint, I think they did this responsibly.\n\nTheir salve is super clean and more traditional—just tallow, olive oil, and essential oils. That’s great for people who want 100% oil-based moisture without preservatives or emulsifiers. The moisturizer, on the other hand, is trying to mimic a conventional lotion texture for folks who prefer a lighter feel. It’s not a red flag—it’s just a different user experience.\n\nIf you’re used to Vanman’s or other balms (like ours), the moisturizer may feel lighter and absorb a bit faster—but with that comes the need for emulsifiers and preservatives. Totally normal and safe when done right, and based on the ingredient list, I’d say they nailed it.\n\nHope that helps you feel more confident in your choice!",

Too much combination happening at once. \n\nAdvice:\nIf you can’t pronounce an ingredient, don’t use it. If you were to use your own judgement system and be successful with finding the right oils, you’d be using natural stuff in the end. Save yourself the time now. \n\nIt was said before, but stay simple. Use your classic base oils, a little essential, and added vitamin E if you’d like. Parfume and Fragrance typically refers to alcohol-based, and you don’t want that on your skin or hair. \n\nSpend $50-75 on amazon and you’ll be able to make yourself quality beard oil for at least a few months.",

I am a bit nervous about some of the safety factors involved. I currently have the oil and lavender in mason jars in a dark cool spot.\n\n#1: While I dried the lavender for a week and then popped it into the oven at 200 degrees F for 5 minutes to be extra safe, I’m nervous they were not completely dried. The flowers fell off when touched slightly but when I snapped the stems it was not a fully clean break. I am just concerned if this poses a risk of mold or botulism and I want to make sure this doesn’t happen. How big of a danger would this pose?\n\n#2: I cleaned the jars thoroughly, but I did not fully “sanitize” them. How bad is this?\n\n#3: I did not wash the lavender before putting it in the oil. The lavender just grows in my backyard in a very dry climate, so I didn’t think this would be an issue at first but now I’m nervous!\n\n#4: should I put the jars of oil in the refrigerator  while the lavender is infusing or will this affect the way it is infused?\n\n#5: is there any way I can test or identify that the oil is safe to use for skincare once the month long process of infusing is done?\n\nThank you all for your help!\n\nEdit: I posted this here because I could not find any other subs that would be suited for my questions. I’m using the lavender infused oil for skincare and not for consumption",

Even if your lavender wasn’t dried crispy (and a lot of people use fresh plant material), there wouldn’t be enough free water for anything to grow as long as all the plant material is completely submersed in the oil. Mold could potentially grow on any stems sticking out the top, for instance. Any little bugs on the flowers would suffocate in the oil. Putting it in the fridge while infusing is not necessary and would probably slow down the process. After filtering out the plant material, you can store the finished infusion in the fridge to help slow down the oil’s natural oxidation.",

I figured I'd try making my own peppermint essential oil and combining it with dermarolling to see if it'd do anything to boost the hair growth on my cheeks.\n\nGot a couple questions beforehand though:\n\n1. I mixed my PEO to about 3-4% with a beard oil containing (among others) apricot kernel oil, avocado oil, argan oil and jojoba oil. I've read [here](https://www.beardwiki.com/dht#known-dht-blockers) that the former three are all DHT blockers. Will this hinder me and should I just get pure jojoba oil?\n2. I've read that peppermint lowers testosterone, is this also true when applied topically? Also, should I apply PEO after dermarolling (better absorption) or stay away from it for 24 hours?(might enter the blood stream and lower testosterone)\n3. How often should I apply PEO, about 1-2x per day?\n4. I have a 0,5mm dermaroller, how often should I use it, about 2-3x per week?\n\nThis might all be a fluke, but I figured it's worth the shot. Any answers would be appreciated!",

Only good thing is that effected areas are my nose, cheek area near my nose and my forehead - rest of the face is ok. My skin has never been perfect but now it is in its worst state. My skin is also very sensitive. I haven't changed anything in my routine. I don't know if it is because I'm getting older (28 now).\n\nMy routine: Couple of hours before I go to sleep I take a shower. I use lush's angels on bare skin (if I rub it in, I do it gentle - sometimes I just let it be on my skin for a moment - this is for not to irritate it). Twice a week I don't use angels on bare skin but eau thermale avene's gentle exfoliating gel (same thing with the rubbing).\n\nAfter showering I put on moisturizer. Moisturizer is made by a local company that operates in my country. Ingredients are: *Aqua, decyl oleate, butylene glycol, cetearyl alcohol (and) cetaryl sulfate, PEG-6 stearate, Apricot Kernel oil PEG-6 esters, PEG-32 stearate, glycol stearate, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\nOnce a week I use payot paris hydra 24 masque to moisturize my skin.

    "body": "**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Aries**\n\nMixed lunar influences may well be a little prickly today. It is likely that a family member could get a touch ambitious on your behalf. If you find that someone close is trying to push you hard in terms of achievements at work or school, be honest in your response!\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Taurus**\n\nThere is a lot of pampering that you can give yourself, you just need to spend a little time exploring what you like. Take yourself to a health food store with a selection of herbal essences. Smell them all and select a few that really ignite your senses. While you are there, purchase some cold pressed almond oil or apricot kernel oil and a few plastic bottles to mix them in. When you get home, experiment with creating your own bath oils!\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Gemini**\n\nIt will be a strange day, thanks to the lunar influences. On the one hand money is looking great; on the other, relationships, particularly romantic ones, are looking a little tense. Finding a common interest or enjoyable activity with your loved ones will soothe any friction nicely!\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Cancer**\n\nConnect on the same wavelength with people instead of fighting against them. Do this by embracing your natural gifts of laughter and good-natured spirit. Your charm and enthusiasm are contagious. These qualities are the best tools you've got.\n\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Leo**\n\nYour intentions may be good today, but they are likely to be misconstrued as interfering. You’ll feel happier advising other people, but the planets suggest that you’ll be trying to ignore some minor problems, possibly financial, of your own. Self discipline may be hard to generate!\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Virgo**\n\nDifficult situations may arise in which you feel like you're doomed no matter what you do. Finding a working solution seems impossible due to the egos of the people involved. Even if everything looks workable on paper, this is no guarantee that things will work out in real life. Be honest and practical and make it a point not to choose sides or be biased in any way.\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Libra**\n\nYou will need to take the alternative viewpoint if you are going to make any headway in a particular relationship today. The astral energy encourages you not to do the same old things, or continue to pigeonhole your partner (current or prospective). Everyone needs room to move and express themselves, and by removing any mental projections of them, you will help them to be more authentically themselves.\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Scorpio**\n\nAlthough your general mood is good, Scorpio, this doesn't mean your day will go off without a hitch. When it comes to projects and getting things done, you may be the one to take the lead. You're good at motivating the troops to move as a unified force. The one thing to be careful of is having selfish motives. If you don't consider the needs of others, there will be mutiny on your ship.\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Sagittarius**\n\nCreative projects that you may have been working on for a while could prove especially ego boosting, Archer. You're doing a great job. A change of employment and increase in income may be in the works. If you don't feel passionate about what you're doing, expect the chance to become involved in an enterprise that you do feel strongly about. New ideas and opportunities could change your life.\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Capricorn**\n\nIt may be best if you stay out of the line of fire, Capricorn. Don't get into others' battles. By choosing sides, you create enemies. Use your compassion to soothe the situation. Use your caring nature to put out the fire. Don't get sucked into the flames where you may add to the confusion. Your job is to stand aside. You can care about the outcome without throwing yourself in headfirst.\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Aquarius**\n\nYou’re probably going to enjoy a boost in your finances, but you may be in too much of a somber mood to enjoy it. If there was ever a day where some retail therapy was needed it is today. Ward off the Monday morning blues with a vibrant friend who can show you where the stylish bargains are!\n\n**Horoscope for January 6 2018 Pisces**\n\nYou may not realize the effect of your erratic behavior on other people, Pisces. They may try to understand your viewpoint, but at times it seems you're talking in riddles. Slow down and clarify your thoughts before you dictate orders to others. You have incredible power. Learn how to harness it and become a good leader so you can make the most effective use of the resources at hand.",
