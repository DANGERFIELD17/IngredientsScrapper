    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

        "body": "I appreciate you taking the time to write this up and the thought and effort behind it. I will say though that there is one part you should seriously consider editing:\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nThis is very incorrect. While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

I used it on and off from age 18 to 21. I have been using it consistently (5-7 days per week) from age 21 to 25 (my current age). I now use 0.1% retin-a almost every night and a few months ago I started using TO 30% AHA + 2% BHA once a week. The AHA + BHA makes my skin really smooth and helps with SFs on my nose. It does not cause redness, dryness, or irritation for me. Could I be doing damage to my skin that I can't see? Or is it ok to use as long as I don't see or feel irritation?",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use.

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Sharing my post here as well. Recently, I had posted requesting dupes for Bite's Agave Lip Mask as it is now being discontinued. This stuff is ride or die lip salvation for me. I live somewhere super dry, work in a dry environment, take meds that dry me out, you get the picture. I'm a moisture junkie. I gathered the piece that works is the lanolin in it so I tried some similar products and wrote some reviews of them.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It also got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. It's good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. It's a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. It's a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, it's going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!",

        "body": "First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair lip balm is my HG for dry lips. It’s a very thick, almost sticky, balm-mask. I usually have to warm a little of the product on my finger before applying it because it is so thick. It has a very slightly minty scent and a slight cooling sensation on application. It comes in a small tin, and one tin lasts me approximately a year of twice daily use. I also work in a hospital environment, and this is the only balm that has ever adequately protected my lips from the dry hospital air. It’s also currently $10 (half off) on their website. Thanks to you, I looked it up so I could post the ingredients and saw the sale so I’ll probably stock up on a little more!\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Cera Alba (Beeswax, Cire d'abeille), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Water/Aqua/Eau, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Aroma (Flavor), Urea, Mel (Honey, Miel), Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hydroxide, EDTA, Eugenol.",

I usually use whatever face lotion I'm using at night on my lips and then put my lanolips on. If my lips are really dry (I just got a crack today so will do tonight) I'll use some First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair cream on my lips then the Lanolips. This helps SO MUCH!

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

        "body": "i'd bet MONEY that the glycerin is the biggest factor, followed by the fact that there are so many more \"sealing\" type ingredients in the second one - the first one is probably doing a lot to reduce combing/brushing friction and static, using silicones to add in some shine, and adding a small amount of hold to help with manageability and frizz, while the second seems like it's more trying to hold onto actual water than create the properties that we as consumers think of as \"moisturized\" (softness, smoothness, manageability, etc). the glycerin is a humectant, meaning it attracts water and holds onto it, and all those oils could initially form a thin barrier to keep that water inside the hairs. that being said, the actual water stuff seems to be genuinely important for some types of hair, particularly very curly natural hair, even if it has little to do with how we imagine \"moisturized\" hair feeling. use whichever product gives you hair that feels and looks the way you like it; neither one is objectively better or worse. i much prefer creams closer to the first one, because my hair dries super slowly already and i'm sort of instinctively resistant to any marketing that pushes \"natural ingredients\" as a selling point, but whatever you prefer is what's best for you!",

    "body": "I am a hairdresser and have been doing Brazilian hair blow-drying in a salon for years. Evaporation of the product during blow-drying burns my eyes, my throat burns, sometimes I feel a burning sensation in my chest, I get headaches and sometimes migraines (I have had migraines for many years, but I noticed that I get them more often when I do more Brazilian treatments) , even some customers shed tears and have to keep their eyes closed while blow-drying. \n\n   \nI’ve never thought too much about the toxicity of the product, so I googled a bit and found a few articles that write about the dangers of the contents of Brazilian treatment products, so I decided to share with you some of the substances found in CHOCOCOCO  and their side effects: \n\n* **Stearic Acid** \\- Inhalation may cause chemical pneumonitis  \n* **Behentrimonium chloride**  is considered toxic in concentrations of 0.1% and above and is suspected to cause skin and eye irritation. \n* **Phenoxyethanol** is actually very harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin, especially for breastfeeding or infants, It can also have an effect on the brain and central nervous system. If you are exposed to the product several times a day, every day, it can accumulate and probably have a bad effect on you. The American Cancer Society warns that formaldehyde is a known carcinogen. This means it can cause cancer or help cancer grow. Formaldehyde can also trigger other side effects. May be toxic in concentrations of 1% or less. Tests show that keratin treatments contain unsafe levels of formaldehyde and other chemicals. The FDA has received dozens of product complaints. One hairdresser, for example, said her treatments caused her migraines, blurred vision, sore throat, nausea and loss of smell. \n* **Glycolic acid**  shows some inhalation toxicity and can cause damage to the respiratory system, thymus and liver if they are present at very high levels over a long period of time. \n* **Coumarin**  is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys. \n* **Benzyl benzoate** side effects: irritations of the skin, eyes, nose and throat that can cause severe symptoms such as burning, nausea, vomiting and damage to the liver and kidneys. \n\n Some manufacturers claim that their keratin treatment does not contain **formaldehyde**, although there are studies that state the opposite. \n\nI would just like to briefly explain the process of Brazilian blow-drying for those who do not know: \n\n1. Hair is washed with a special shampoo (from the manufacturer, of course) \n2. The product is applied to dry hair, after 20 min it is blow-dried  \n3. Blow-drying causes a strong and visible evaporation of the product, the steam of which goes straight into my face (after blow-drying, the whole salon stinks of it, and is in the fog)  \n4. Hair is ironed at 220'C (which causes evaporation, but not in such quantities)  \n5. After the treatment, the hair is washed with special shampoos (Again, from the manufacturer, of course) \n\nI just want to state that I am not a chemist nor am I knowledgeable in chemistry in any way so I hope if someone is educated in this field I would be grateful if you would leave an opinion, also I do not know the percentage of these substances because their website does not state it.  \n\nHere is a list of all the ingredients in their product: \n\n Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Keratin / Hydrolysed Keratin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark / Leaf / Twig Extract, Calendula Officinalis (Marigold) Flower Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Behentrimonium Chloride, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii, Shea Butothera Evening Primrose) Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Salt), Dehydroacetic Acid, Aloe (Vera) Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Squalane, Ascorbic Acid Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Fragrance, Retinyl Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Glycolic Acid, Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate  \n\nThanks for reading and I will be grateful for any information and opinions <3",

        "body": "Hmm looking at that ingredients list I have to say it looks very innocent imo! I would have expected to see some hard core stuff in such product. Looking at Kerastase and Redken ingredients lists are generally way more frightening. I can’t see any really nasty things in the list- the nastiest ones are Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha- isomethyl ionone and benzoyl salicylate. These are fragrances that are more allergenic than when the list just says fragrance or perfume ( the manufacturer has to write the most allergenic fragrances separately in the list). But again- all of these will be found in almost any salon hair products with fragrance- and in a lot of “ natural” products as well. Phenoxyethanol is in basically every product you buy for hair, body or face. It acts as a stabilizer or as a preservative in products and became highly popular when parabens got unpopular. It is generally considered safe in small concentrations ( under 1%) for adults. It’s not considered safe for children under age 3 and should not be used if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. It has nothing to do with Formaldehyde as far as I know. Again- phenoxyethanol is in almost any product, even in the most sensitive no perfume no color brands. If you have to avoid it I think you would be limited to raw oils and the baby products.\nOverall I think that the list looks very descent. With some quite good stuff in it as well.\nAlso FYI I’m not educated in this, so I’m by no means an expert- it’s just a weird hobby😅\n\nEdit: I would also recommend wearing a mask and glasses when using. It looks safe when applying normally to hair but it’s not meant to be inhaled/ go in the eyes of course.",

        "body": "While you’re not wrong that the traditional Brazilian blowout is very toxic and releases formaldehyde when heat is applied to the hair the initial time at the salon, I am not reading anything specifically in those ingredients you listed that would cause this process. Glycolic acid would be suspected if it were high on the list, because glyxolic acid and ingredients with similar names may consist of one of the first ingredients in a “new and improved” Brazilian blowout (which still releases formaldehyde, they tend to just be sneakier about their product claims). The ingredient list you posted doesn’t have those ingredients, from what I can tell (but hey, I’m not a chemist, so if anyone is an expert in that field, please chime in). \n\nBehentrimonium chloride is an extremely popular ingredient in many hair conditioners, both drugstore branded and professional. I haven’t heard any recent research regarding controversy with the ingredient, but it very well could only be toxic under certain circumstances of which I can’t attest to (such as applying heat and keratin with it). \n\nThe first ingredient is water, the next is a harmless emulsifier (which allows the cream to keep it from separating), the third ingredient is an animal protein that comes from animal hair/hooves/horns. It’s not a scary ingredient, it’s just a cheap protein compared to keratin. Then keratin, followed by a lot of essential oils (which I wouldn’t be surprised if they were the culprit here). Fragrances, especially ones as volatile as essential oils, *especially* when you mix a buttload of them, generally do not play well with being heated against the hair at 450F. The rest of the ingredients are comprised of ingredients that make up less than ~1%, like tiny fragrance ingredients (linalool, limonine), and preservatives to keep it from spoilage (benzyl salicylate). \n\nI would definitely discontinue that brand, especially because unless there are extra ingredients/steps in the treatment aside from that ingredient list, I’m not sure I understand how they are meant to last for 3-6 months on anyone. None of the ingredients to form any sort of lasting keratin bond to the hair appear to be in that ingredient list, and the ones that could potentially play any role are in such minutes qualities to almost be meaningless. The glycolic acid being near the end of the ingredient list suggests it’s much more likely that it was a minor pH adjustment to the formula, not any life-changing chemical reaction. It seems as if your salon is getting ripped off by whoever is promoting their line of keratin treatments to you. The Cezanne line is one of the better ingredient lists out there, but I’ve only been doing a deep dive (as a current stylist) on this treatment since right before I did one on myself. I did the long lasting Cezanne treatment and there is absolutely no smell at any point in the process. You just have to make sure when you rinse the product, you don’t rinse too much of it out before you pat-dry and blow dry or there won’t be enough keratin still on the hair to bond correctly.",

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

[These](https://imgur.com/0usXnff.jpg) [photos](https://imgur.com/C5Ze0Ci.jpg) [were taken](https://imgur.com/P7jxw8L.jpg) [at 10 PM](https://imgur.com/k14jWR5.jpg) . I had applied lip balm once in the morning at 10 ish and then no more re-applications. Ordinary lip balms do jackshit for me. The general tube lip balms like Nivea, Maybelline, Lakme etc simply can't keep up, I have to apply those once every half an hour. Also **I'm not on tret** or anything like that currently.\n\n# \n\n# ENN Pucker\n\n* **Review Type:** Rave\n* **Price (range):** INR 900 for 15 gms, bought it at 25% off for 675\n* **Availability in India:** Easily Available online on ENN's own site, Nykaa and other\n* **Skin info:** Dry. Extremely dry, prone to chapping. Dry in all weathers. Dry since I was a child. Dry.\n* **Ingredient list:** [Shea Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Jojoba Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/simmondsia-chinensis-seed-oil), [Castor Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ricinus-communis-seed-oil), [Beeswax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [E Wax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/e-wax) 📷, [CCTG](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Honey](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/honey), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Tocopherol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopherol), [Hyaluronic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hyaluronic-acid), [Butterscotch Flavour](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butterscotch-flavour)\n* **Special info:** [Packaging instructions](https://imgur.com/7ZeyJDs.jpg) say \"Patch Test recommended. For external use only. This product is not edible. In case of irritation, stop using the product immediately\". Also skincarisma says the butter and oils aren't malassezia safe\n* **Experience & opinion:**\n\n**Texture:** It's [waxy consistency](https://imgur.com/V27yke7.jpg), that can definitely feel [vaguely gritty](https://imgur.com/oWhgRT1.jpg)  sometimes, but usually feels smooth. Spreads easily.**Fragrance:** Butterscotch. Doesn't feel too artificial. Or over powering. Can smell it on application, but settles down afterwards.\n\n**Packaging:** Comes in a [glass tub with a plastic screw cap](https://imgur.com/wcXKAbw.jpg). Has a protective lip inside. [Outer packaging](https://imgur.com/PbrVT7L.jpg) is textured cardboard that comes sealed in plastic, for tamper proof, I guess. But they should try avoiding it.\n\n**Usage:** It's meant to be used as sleeping mask or night balm. Packaging instructions say \" Directions: Take the product on the tip of your finger. Apply a generous layer of this soothing mask at bedtime on your lips\"I use this primarily as a day balm. Because Dry lips.\n\n**My Application method**, I take a teeny weeny bit, scrape it off on my bottom lip, the remaining on upper lip. Massage it onto my bottom lip with my finger and purse lips and use that to spread the balm on the upper lip\n\nOn **application**, \\[[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/78FbYOI.jpg), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/nAJ2nh7.jpg), [Pic 3](https://imgur.com/kvd8S5P.jpg) in various lighting conditions\\] The grittiness is not too much and doesn't feel disturbing. but if you purse lips together there is some grittiness that can be felt. BUT this grittiness is not ever present, it's sometimes there, sometimes not there. *You can see a little speck that the grittiness left behind in the attached photos, look at the top right corner.* If you drink water like I do, like a toddler without skills, spilling and dribbling it all over you, it **may** need to be re-applied.\n\nRegarding **performance**, Little bit actually goes a long way. It creates a pink stain. Feeling on lips is similar to maybelline baby lips (when it's not gritty), you can feel it but it's not heavy or glue like or uncomfortable.On an average, this keeps my lips moisturised for 3.45 hours ± 15 minutes. This timeline is consistent. Beyond that time, lips were still soft, no chapping, no cracking for around 30 minutes, after which proper dryness would start and I would need to re-apply. Generally, I'd apply this as soon as I wake up, After breakfast, After lunch, Around 6 in the evening. So 4 times a day.\n\nI've heard tinted balms sometime darken lips, I've noticed nothing of the sort with this. I naturally have two-toned lips, and this did not even them out or anything. Nor was I expecting it too.\n\nOn **longevity**, Even with me, applying it 4 times a day, I've barely made a dent. I'm sure this will last long.. maybe 6 to 8 months, minimum (my personal opinion is that this will be one of those products that just don't die). IF, of course, it doesn't spoil or something, because like I said, don't know if there's a preservative. And if you are going to use it only at night time, I'd estimate a year.\n\nEditing on 20/10/2020 : There's a dip in my tub already, I'm revising my estimate to six months. Will update once again when I complete the tub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I use it the way I've outlined above, For the purpose of this review, I also tested it out as a\n\n* Healing balm - With first application being at 11:30 PM, second at 1:30 AM (applied a very thick layer) and repeated applications at 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 2:30 PM, 5:30 PM, 7:00 PM, 10;00 PM,  lips had come to normal at 1:00 AM. But at 8.15 the next day, Lips were verging on dry again. That is they feel soft to touch but I could feel the dryness starting.\n* Sleeping Mask - It does okay and moisturises for 7 hours IF, lips were previously in a good shape and by that I mean, no dryness, no cracking, no peeling. If there was any prior dryness, I'd up with peeling, lips. And even if everything was great, if I slept for longer than 7 hours I'd wake up with chapped lips.\n\n**Analysing Price**, at 675 for 12 months in the case of use as a sleeping mask and at 1350, in the case of a daily balm, I'd say it's worth it. Even a normal balm like maybelline baby lips would be (140 \\* 12 = 1680), Neutrogena (190 \\* 12 = 2280). Buy ONLY ON DISCOUNT. \n\nEditing on 20/10/2020, 675 \\* 2 is 1350 and at this price it maybe a skip. At full price 100% a skip. I've bought some other stuff that's hopefully more cost effective. Will try it out and review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. No spatula. Don't listen to the packaging instructions and dip your fingers inside. They make no mention of preservatives.\n2. Can scrape it off with a spoon but Have got to use fingers while application.\n3. Might get messy if you're using this in professional / office set up. Have to wash hands each time. or keep multiple spoons and tissues with you at all times, of course this doesn't count if you have normal human lips and only use it as a night balm.\n4. I'm not convinced that the ingredients list is complete. **I DMed ENN's insta account asking if this was the full list and whether there are any preservatives,** [**I've been left on read**](https://imgur.com/t896G3O.jpg)**. Make of that what you will.** If I ever get a reply, I'll update that as well. **Edit: Got a reply \"No preservatives in pucker. It's only made up of butters.\"**\n5. No SPF (this is a personal con, since they meant for this to be used differently) but I'm mentioning it for other lizard people like myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Repurchase Status:** May re-purchase, if I don't get tempted my something else.\n\n***Final Words:*** To be honest, I had major buyer's regret after buying this, and it only increased when I saw the ingredients list. Especially when I saw castor oil (Castor oil & my skin aren't friends). But I was running out of Laneige, saw hyaluronic acid and implusively bought it after reading a few reviews.  But having used it over the last two months, I'm actually pretty happy with it. Definitely good and effective for my purposes.\n\nAs with any other review / product / treatment YMMV.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Laneige Sleeping Mask [Berry Variant]\n\n* **Review Type:** Rave\n* **Price (range):** INR 1100 for 20 gms\n* **Availability in India:** Available online on Nykaa, Beautybarn and others or you's have to ship it from Korea\n* **Skin info:** Dry.

It did not heal my lips overnight the day it does for most people. My lips were in a very, very bad condition. Dry, cracking, peeling. I was removing layers of dried skin every few hours. Laneige brought me back from the brink. it took 4 to 5 days. By that I mean the first few days I had to apply it every hour, then every two hour, three hours and then I woke up with non-scaly, human like lips one day. And I fell in love. It's why I had great expectations. I've recommended to people I know IRL. Bought it as gifts. Praised it online etc. I have had a huge bias towards this balm. I used it as sleeping mask initially because that was what it was, but after experimenting I realised it's better as day balm for me. And after even further experimentation, I've decided it's best as a healing balm.\n\n**Texture:** It's has a [balmy](https://imgur.com/gg5fT1K.jpg) super smooth consistency. Spreads easily.\n\n**Fragrance:** Berry. Doesn't smell over powering. Had to sniff the tub to get a strong whiff of it. Can barely smell it after application\n\n**Packaging:** Comes in a plastic tub with a plastic screw cap. The 8gm variant does not have a spatula but the 20 gms variant, comes with a very useful silicone spatula\n\n**Usage:** It's meant to be used as sleeping mask or night balm.I use this primarily as a day balm. Because Dry lips. Same as pucker.\n\nMy **Application method**, I take a teeny weeny bit, scrape it off on my bottom lip, the remaining on upper lip. Massage it onto my bottom lip with my finger and purse lips and use that to spread the balm on the upper lip\n\nOn **application**, definitely heavier on the lips compared to most balms. A little sticky. [No stain,](https://imgur.com/ASbyXSr.jpg) [just looks glossy.](https://imgur.com/RIGBH33.jpg)  It kind of makes the vertical lines in my lips disappear. Lips get a soft-focused look even in real life.\n\nRegarding **performance**, This has never been the best sleeping mask for me,  It wears away in the night. It does heal and maintains lip health in the long term.\n\n**As a healing balm,** which is my current use for it, the mask gets rid of the dry skin. But after 3 to 4 days of continuous application and then I relax with the application. If I get lazy and don't apply balm properly and get to the cracking, bleeding stage, then rinse repeat. But so far the best at healing that I found. When I was testing this against ENN, this got my levels to same level ENN did after 9 uses, in 6 uses.\n\n**As a day balm,** the performance of this was so inconsistent, that I was getting frustrated trying to keep track of it. One day it averaged 2 hours of moisturisation, the next day 4, the third day 3. I wasn't able to average out anything. Which I did not expect at all. When it works, it works, but I'm not able to make sure it works optimally 100% of the time. It was baffling because I'd used it for almost 1.5 years. External factors seem to affect it's performance a lot, like talking a lot, drinking water etc.\n\n**As a sleeping mask,** the day I timed it and took pictures it lasted 8 hours. But again inconsistent. Some days I wake up with soft, moisturised lips and on other days, flaky ones. It's not reliable.\n\nMy two-tone lips are genetic and I'm perfectly happy with them, but in case you were wondering this balm had no effect on them. Didn't lighten or darken anything.\n\nOn **longevity**,  Little bit definitely goes a long long way. Even the little 8 gms one lasted more than 6 months, I think, as a night time balm. Now that I'm using it as a day balm the 20 gms tub lasted around 8 to 9 months (It lasted longer but there were intervals in the middle when I completely neglected skincare including this, so 8 to 9 months, is an estimate of cumulative usage.\n\n**Analysing Price**, Definitely worth the price, If you're using it as sleeping mask. Taking a conservative estimate of 8 months, the annual cost works out to INR 1460, which more than ENN but the difference isn't significant, in my opinion.\n\n**Cons:**  No SPF (this is a personal con, since they meant for this to be used differently)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Repurchase Status:** Will re-purchase only the small tub in the future, since I mean to use this purely for healing purposes, for as and when I behave like an idiot and damage my lips.\n\n***Final Words:*** It's a good option for lizard people, but definitely not the best. While it works, it works great. But it's inconsistent.\n\nAs with any other review / product / treatment YMMV.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Comparative Review of ENN Pucker and Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask\n\nPoints to Note\n\n* As always, pictures were taken from a potato phone so forgive the low quality\n* I didn't have a professional lighting set-up, so lighting is iffy and inconsistent, I chose to go with whatever light was showcasing what I wanted to convey\n* All photos are unedited,\n* All Notes are copy-pasted from my original notes and maybe in present / present continuous tense\n* The daily balm test started at 11:30, while everything else started early was because I used my normal PM routine, which keeps my lips moisturised till then, Neither Pucker nor Laneige could do that.\n* Laneige's daily day balm notes mention attempt 1, because I tried documenting it's performance over several days. Some days were better, some days worse, but this was average, so I'm recording this one alone.\n* I repeated Pucker's sleeping mask test several times as well, and results were consistent. 7 hours max, if I sleep beyond that chapped lips, so I'm adding pics at the 8 hour mark instead,\n* No other re-applications other than what I've mentioned below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**ENN Pucker**|**Laneige**|\n|:-|:-|\n|**As a daily day balm**|**As a daily day balm, Attempt 1**|\n|[11:30 AM](https://imgur.com/bETBkFd.jpg)|11:30 AM  [Applied it](https://imgur.com/ASbyXSr.jpg), first application of the day, lips had gotten a teeny bit dry, before application.|\n|1:30 had lunch, lips felt like the [moisturiser was still there before lunch](https://imgur.com/2Pp6iX7.jpg).

It looked that way in real life too. could be because of lighting, either way there's a layer of lip balm on.|\n|7: 05 [woke up with dry lips](https://imgur.com/Ol1cipL.jpg). Im shocked. I expected pucker to hold it's own. Contradictory results. Need to re-check, I knew neither of them would work for as sleeping mask, the performance of this was genuinely worser than laneige.  *Note: I did re-check and it's okay for 7 hours. Chapping starts beyond that.  Also adding Pics in* [*different lighting*](https://imgur.com/NJOrZRW.jpg) *&* [*contortions*](https://imgur.com/g1F4qZa.jpg) *to showcase the dryness.

Lips did not feel moisturised per say but they felt soft. Normal. They way normal humans probably feel, instead of the lizards that I evolved from. BUT. Within half hour I were starting to feel dry. Took pictures in weird contortions to show that.|\n|||\n|**As a Healing Mask**|**As a Healing Mask**|\n|9 Applications|6 Applications|\n|||\n|||\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\n* Before I started documenting with time and pictures, I would have definitely recommended laneige over pucker.\n* I'm now pretty certain that pucker is better than laneige, for everything except extreme healing.  If lips are not chapped or extremely dry or peeling, pucker is better at maintaining that good health.\n* Even on the days laneige performed well, it only matched Pucker. Did not exceed it.\n* But leaving performance aside, I'm not happy with ENNs customer service.\n* Once again YMMV.\n* Also  irrelevant to you guys, but all these photos made me realise that my lips are asymmetrical and the blissful ignorant bubble I was in, has now burst. sigh.",

    "body": "Hey all!! I had posted not too long ago requesting help finding a dupe for my now discontinued lip balm, the Bite Agave Lip Mask. I took recommendations and compromised on some of my wishlist for ingredients, as I realized no one else makes a balm with an identical ingredient list. I figured in case anyone else is struggling with replacing this, I'd share what I found. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It too got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. Its good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. Its a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. Its a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, its going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!!",

    "body": "They released an article a few weeks ago about farm-to-face beauty products. My feelings about the movement towards \"natural\" aside, the writer recommended a $60 cleansing oil, and included this following line:\n\n> [It's paraben-, preservative- and chemical-free, and smells divine.] (https://www.refinery29.com/2018/01/189611/natural-ethical-beauty-products-farm-to-face#slide-1) \n\nI am taking offense at the preservative-free claim. This is not only factually wrong, this is extremely dangerous.\n\nLet me make this clear: the marketing copy for this product doesn't claim to be preservative-free. The copy brags about having AHA and plant extracts, but they don't claim to be [preservative-free] (https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/african-botanics-pure-marula-cleansing-oil.html). If the company did, they would have been wrong. \n\nThis is the ingredient list: \n\n>Glycerin, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Aqua, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Sorbitan Oleate, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Moringa Pterygosperma (Moringa) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Isoamyl Laurate, Lauryl Glucoside, Coco Glucoside, Eriocephalus punctulatus (Chamomile Cape) Essential Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit) Essential Oil, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccahrinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Extract, Tocopherol Acetate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate\\*, Citral\\*, Citronellal\\*, Geraniol\\*, Limonene\\*, Linalool\\*. \\*Constituents Of Natural Essential Oils Used. \\*\\*Certified Organic. 100% Vegan. Gluten-free.\n\nGuess what? Both dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol are used as preservatives. So the writer's claim about preservative-free is factually wrong.\n\nHere's the bigger issue, though: cosmetic products need preservative systems. \n\nYou cannot sell an unsafe product. Cosmetics are often a mixture of oils and water, which is perfect breeding ground for disease agents like mold and bacteria and viruses and fungi. This means that you cannot sell a product without an adequate preservative system. These germs need to be killed, or you will sicken someone, if not kill them. \n\nEven if you did your best to disinfect the manufacturing equipment, and even if all of the employees involved in manufacture practice safe manufactory practices, bacteria and mold can still get in. Plus, as a consumer uses the product, it will accumulate bacteria, fungi and mold over time. If these are allowed to grow unimpeded, this can change the color, scent, texture, etc of the product. Consumers like having a product that lasts as long as possible. As such, it is very important to have a system in place to preserve the product, not only to preserve human health, but to keep a product usable for as long as possible. \n\nTherefore, suggesting that a product 100% lacks preservatives, and implying that this is a good thing, is extremely irresponsible. By suggesting that having no system in place is more ethical, natural, or safe, you are endangering people's lives. Additionally, you are forcing your readers to spend more money on products than they need to, simply because preservative systems are necessary for it to last long enough for it to be used up. \n\n(I will note that there are products that claim to be self-preserving; these products don't use traditional preservatives, but they still have a system in place. Whether these are adequate is outside the scope of this post, but even the natural cosmetic lines agree that preserving products is a good thing.)\n\nAlso, the chemical-free line is just wrong. All matter is chemical. Oil is a chemical, extracts are chemicals, water is a chemical... ",

    "body": "I was on Sephora.com last week about to order some Kat Von D makeup removing wipes (I was hoping to find something that would take off waterproof everything and I recall the sample of hers doing the trick, as in being ridiculously oily.) when I came across something brand new: [Urban Decay's Makeup Removing Wipes](http://www.sephora.com/meltdown-makeup-remover-wipes-P409954?skuId=1850403&icid2=D=c6:products%20grid:p409954). I can literally not find these anywhere else, not a review, nothing. Or at least I couldn't prior to Friday. I was trying to find an ingredient list before ordering, but it was as though they did not exist other than the listing on Sephora.com to buy.  Since they were really reasonably priced (ETA: reasonable by Sephora standards.) and you get 100 wipes in the pack, I figured what the hell. I seem to have no self control when it comes to anything makeup related and just buy it like it's nothin'. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/b2kCl2Z\n\nThey arrived today and even though it's only 530 pm, and I really don't normally take my makeup off this early so as not to scare small children or offend their sensibilities (my niece has some pretty strong opinions about me going out without makeup on: she \"doesn't prefer it.\") I could not wait to test them out and see if they worked better than the [Aveeno ones](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5600049)  (shit, yo, Ulta charges way more, get em at Target or Drugstore.com or something!) I'd been using or if they burned any less. (FYI--they still burn but not as badly, but I have ridiculously sensitive skin, plus retinoids. So, everything burns.) \n\n\n\n*Sizing, and about the wipe:*\n\nThe sheets themselves are bit smaller (6.5\" x 4.5\") than the Aveeno ones (7.4\" x7.2\" per the package, so a little over 7\" square), but compared to the Aveeno ones were slightly damper--not as wet as I would like though and not as wet as I recall the Aveeno ones being in the past--and certainly not as damp as the Simple Micellar Wipes are.  I've had several packs of Aveeno ones that have been really dry lately from the start, and dried out before the pack was even half done. \n\nThe wipes themselves are texturally similar. The Aveeno ones are slightly thicker, and stronger than the UD ones, but the UD ones are labeled as biodegradable. \n\nA used UD wipe:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tcuMw6M\n\n\n\n*Efficacy/Usage:*\n\nI usually use one Aveeno wipe (out of a 25 wipe pack) at a time, and that will take off most or all of my waterproof eye makeup (yknow, assuming it is wet enough) and then will go over my whole face with one of the Simple Micellar wipes to make sure any oiliness is gone. There are still times where I don't get all of the eye makeup off, because I pile it on. Often what is left is mascara, and I either give up, or will go over my lashes with another wipe OR use one of the Ocusoft scrub pads to get it off. \n\nI felt due to the size of the Urban Decay wipes that I needed two. I probably didn't, but for the sake of comfort, I did use two. Given that 100 come in the pack, even if I use two at a time, I will still get twice as much out of this pack assuming it doesn't dry out before I run out.  I still used the Simple wipe afterward, because again, oily.  I did not really have anything left on my eyes or lashes afterwards, and didn't feel like I needed to go over my lashes or eyes at all. There might be a tiny bit of something still on there, but not enough that I feel like I need to worry about it. I'd go to bed like this.   Tonight I have boxing, so I will still shower, so I don't care--I'll be washing my face again.\n\nBefore/After photos, try not to have nightmares:\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/P4MOMdb\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/qmJiPAq\n\nA:  http://imgur.com/1BbCxIF\n\n\n\n*Pricing:*\n\nThe price difference is significant, but I felt worthwhile.  The Aveeno wipes are around $6.99 (at Target) for a pack of 25. The Urban Decay were $20 for a pack of 100. So basically to get as many Aveeno wipes as UD wipes, you'd pay $27.96 assuming you didn't find them on sale/coupon deal. Though, I guess considering you're using two UD wipes, it's really half that, so $13.98, given I need one Aveeno for every two UD wipes (need...maybe. Used, yes.) And again, that assumes the Aveeno ones are not dried out. \n\n\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\nI took a photo of the package, it's not great. \nhttp://imgur.com/Gqw4mWc\n\nList is:\n\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Gluconolactone, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Sunflower Seed Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Olive Oil, Lavender Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Calcium Gluconate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Chloride, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopheryl, Malic Acid, Sunflower Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract\n\n\nBut this product has five natural oils in it, vs none in the Aveeno.  Here's the list from Ulta on the Aveeno:\n\nWater, Isononyl Isononanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Isostearyl Palmitate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-6, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Sucrose Cocoate, Fragrance, Carbomer, PEG-4 Laurate, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Chrysanthemum Parthenium(Feverfew) Flower/Leaf/Stem Juice, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Glycerin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract.  The package says there's a 3 month shelf life, which I think given the ingredient list is interesting, though, it's heavy on the natural oils, and maybe they're less stable?  Compared to the Aveeno list, it's significantly more natural. \n\n\n\n*Bottom Line:*\n\nI am pretty impressed after one use. I will see how I feel after several more. I want to see if they dry out and how quickly they dry out if they do.   But efficacy in the first use made them worth my while. \n\nedited to correct stupid typo\n\n\n**24 hours later update:**\n\nI just did my second use today and I was able to use ONE wipe this time (well that was my requirement of myself this time), and it worked just fine, both eyes completely clean. I followed with the Simple Micellar wipe all over and briefly around my eyes, bec I am just that anal, and my face is spiffy.  Then I just applied my serums and all that after like normal.  *Fingers crossed* that my face doesn't lose it's marbles with all the natural oils. ",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "*Moisturisers seem to be the most boring and ignored category in a skincare regime but I have learnt over the years that they actually play the most important role. Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

    "body": "**Full product name:** [Nature Republic California Aloe Fresh Powdery Sun Stick SPF 50+ PA++++](https://imgur.com/a/eh4pxrF) (24g of product) \n\n\nHi everyone!! I don’t think I’ve seen a review on here for this one, and no one mentioned it in the recent thread about sunscreen sticks, so I figured I should finally post something. \n\n**About Me:** combo, sensitive, acne-prone skin. Sunscreens that I truly like and have repurchased are Canmake Mermaid UV gel & Skin Aqua UV milk, although I have tried many. I like different finishes for different reasons, but generally prefer something more satin. \n\n**Price:** I bought this on yesstyle for $22 at the end of last year, and it’s currently $17 there. It’s 25,000 ₩ on the Korean Nature Republic site, which is about $20 USD, so I would just wait to find it on sale but overall it’s kind of expensive imo. \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nThere are pictures online of an older packaging, so I think this has been around for a while and then was reformulated and repackaged. Here are the current ingredients from YesStyle - \n\nButylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Polyethylene, Dimethicone, **Octocrylene**, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Silica, **Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)**, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, **Ethylhexyl Salicylate (Octyl Salicylate)**, **Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus)**, **Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb S)**, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ozokerite, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (0.2 ppm), Morinda Citrifolia Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Sinensis Flower/Leaf Extract, (-)-alpha-bisabolol, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sea Water, Water, Butylene Glycol, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Application:** This product is alcohol free and contains a lot of silicone, which is obvious. It has a veryyyy silky slippery powdery feel, similar to a silicone makeup primer. Sometimes the thought of touching my face with sunscreen lotion hands grosses me out lol, so I like how easy and clean gliding this on my face is. Upon application, it diminishes a little bit of the shine on my face, but it’s pretty subtle and I couldn’t get a good picture of this effect. \n\n**Finish:** I would say it’s a satin finish, but will depend on your skin type. It might mattify oily skin a little, but for dry skin I suspect it would leave the tiniest sheen. Because it’s so slippery, makeup does glide on top pretty well but if you’re trying to spot conceal blemishes or something then that might be a negative point because the makeup won’t be able to stick to a specific spot. If I apply makeup it will emphasize dry skin flakes a tiny bit, even if I don’t use face powder. I didn’t notice any foundation separation issues though. \n\n**Effectiveness:** I’ve found most Korean sunscreens are not water-resistant and I don’t think this one is either. I use it for first application on days where I’m not going outside much, or for reapplication later in the day. If you’re going to sweat or swim, I would choose something else just to be safe. I haven’t noticed any freckles or sunburns, but again, I don’t really use it for strong sun exposure anyway. I also don’t think this has been independently tested after all the sunscreen drama last year (yet? If it has then please let me know!). \n\n**Smell:** As the name implies, it has an aloe and “fresh/clean” scent. It doesn’t bother me and fades pretty quickly. \n\n**TLDR:** I would give this a 3/5 rating. If you’re looking to try your first satin-finish sun stick, I think this is a decent option, especially if you can get it on sale. It’s pretty average and I like it enough to keep using, but it’s not so amazing that I’ll repurchase. \n\nI think I’ll try the isntree airy sun stick or the make p:rem one next, if anyone has a review for those!",

    "body": "Winters means chilly winter winds, low humidity, dry indoor heat, lowered thirst, reduced perspiration, hot showers, friction from itchy - thick clothes and perpetual dryness. Winters means dryness & cracked lips for me.\n\n[LIPPSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/5phvc72etx661.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a379572e84286d26fce0b36539b61233412ec8)\n\nThe prime way to fix dry lips is to increase your water intake. Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ₹40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ₹130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ₹250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ₹1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering. The tingle is not intense. I will not be repurchasing this.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax/Cera Microcristallina/Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Mica, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax/Candelilla Cera Hydrocarbons/Cire De Candelilla, Candelilla Wax Esters, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera/Cire De Carnauba, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090), Limonene, Yellow 10 Lake (Ci 47005), Water/Aqua/Eau, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Linalool, Potassium Alginate, Glycerin, Propanediol, BHT, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Ascorbyl Glucoside*\n\n***Rating: 3/5, WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***RiRe Bubble Bubble Mask: - Bubbling mask that does nothing.

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have accumulated a great deal of different shampoos from various indie companies throughout my time here and I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on them!\n\nSince everyone's hair is different, your experiences might differ from mine, so just keep that in mind! For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

    "body": "I did a [first impressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fc7lcw/regimen_lab_skincare_first_impressions_ingredient/) on the Regimen skincare kit I got almost 3 months ago. \n\nI got a little overexcited (blame my ADHD) but after using them for like 2 months and 3 weeks or so, I have a better idea about how they worked out for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*My skin type:* Dehydrated, **SUPER dry** skin. I mean, **REALLY dry.** Already had dry skin but with tret every other day, it's crazy, crazy dry. I can't do regular tret either, gotta be microsphere. \n\n*Climate:* Dry, desert Cali. Not too cool but not disgustingly hot as of yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, let me eat my words. I figured out that my skin does best with many different hydrating AND nourishing/fatty layers. Trying to simplify my routine made my skin drier and drier and I found myself missing my old products. Anyways.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\n# LEVEL Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tranexamic acid, NAG, Alpha Arbutin, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Hexanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate, Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, Hexylresorcinol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Salix Alba Bark Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Light, liquidy, slightly gel-like. Has a \"glycol\" feel rather than completely water-like. I think people who have never felt the raw glycols before describe it as something slightly \"oily\". Dimethyl isosorbide also feels similar to glycols, but much lighter and not sticky like them. Absorbs quickly. Non-sticky. Layers well with others. \n\n**COLOR:** Pale yellow-tinted transparent gel.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture/pore refinement. Noticeable, but not hugely so. \n\nI am ***extremely*** prone to dark spots. I only get breakouts on my chin. The PIE/PIH that gets left over from acne are only on my chin. The other spots are from sun damage. Aaaand, as you can see from the before and after pictures, my dark spots have actually gotten slightly worse, and more numerous. It's easier to tell irl than in pictures. \n\n[Before/After pics](https://imgur.com/a/SAWwCqK)\n\nI feel like I haven't given it enough time to see real results since I used it for less than 3 months. 3 months is the standard time you should give skin-brightening products time to work. But from the results I can glean from this limited time, I am not super impressed. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to give it another try if it comes out for $35 instead of $45, because I *mostly blame the switch to a new sunscreen* on my spots darkening/getting more dark spots. \n\nI know many people love the Purito centella sunscreen, but it just is not protective enough for my skin type. I am super diligent about sun protection, and the 99% of the sun I get is from commuting in the car once or twice a week (\\~20 min) and sitting in front of windows for meals. I have blackout curtains in my room and only exercise during the night. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm honestly kind of upset that the progress on my dark spots that I worked so hard on for years have been reversed a little. \n\nAnyways, the ingredient list is absolutely fantastic. It's definitely a much better deal than Skinceuticals' 3% tranexamic + 5% niacinamide serum. So perhaps if I use a better sunscreen and give it longer, LEVEL may work better for me. \n\n**PRICE:** *$35-45 /30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# VITAMIN X Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Acetyl Zingerone, Glycerin, Hexanediol, Tocopherol, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Ferulic Acid, Resveratrol, Genistein, Glutathione, Quercetin, Silymarin, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Also has a \"glycol feel\". Lightweight, absorbs quickly. Feels like I should use it after watery toners, but since it's vitamin C, I used it before anything else. \n\n**COLOR:** Orange tinted transparent gel. It did not change color the entire time I have had it, but I can't be sure of course, because of the original color. I imagine I will only be able to tell once it oxidizes heavily and turns brownish. \n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture refinement. Like the LEVEL serum, I started out only using it once a day. Then I switched to using it twice a day after about almost a month in or so. \n\nGave my skin a subtle, soft glow. \n\nCompared to the Timeless Vitamin C serum, I just didn't see nearly as much texture/pore refinement and glow factor. I have the type of skin that sees zero results from ascorbic acid derivatives (SAP, MAP, etc).\n\nA bit disappointing on the visual results department, but perhaps other people may like it for all the other antioxidants loaded in this serum that may be protecting the skin without visual refinement. \n\nI was still happily using it up, BUT, I had to stop several days ago. I noticed that it was suddenly filled with tons of little grains??? \n\nI'm not sure if you can [**see it in the pictures**](https://imgur.com/a/PkTvttF), but it almost seems like the vitamin C in the serum spontaneously changed back to powder form.\n\nWhat the hell happened? Stability issue? I am not sure. \n\nAmbitious little serum, but it didn't work out for me in practice.\n\nI'm testing out Maelove Glow Maker at the moment, and so far Timeless is winning out but since it's only been a very short time, we'll see. Am planning to try a Skinceuticals sample next. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$50-60 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Betaine, Glycerin, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Sorbitol, Lactic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pectin, Proline, Serine, Arginine, Glucose, Fructose, Maltose, Trehalose, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** A thin gel. Thicker and heavier-feeling than LEVEL & VITAMIN X. Absorbs a little slower. Still lightweight.  \n\n**COLOR:** A slightly cloudy, transparent.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** It has a ton of beneficial ingredients, and was pretty hydrating. But for some reason, I found myself reaching for this less than my other, more watery hydrating essences/toners. \n\nIt may just be my personal preference, but I've been more into thinner, watery layers more than thicker ones as of late. \n\nFelt similar to Hada Labo Premium lotion but a little less hydrating? I still quite enjoyed using it. \n\nThis would be plenty of hydration for most people probably, but I have exceptionally dry skin, and this by itself was not enough to really plump out my skin. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$40-50 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe, if it was cheaper. Urea in serum form is a really rare find. But I can probably get a similar effect with a couple of different serums and a urea moisturizer combined for cheaper. If my skin wasn't so darn dehydrated and dry, this would be a fantastic all-in-one sort of convenient step for me since it really has every humectant your skin can use/has naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TABULA RASA Cleanser\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Betaine, Propanediol, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and) Aqua (and) PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Phenylpropanol, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin.* \n\n**TEXTURE:** A fluid gel. It doesn't foam up a whoooole lot, but the ideal amount foams up to a thick, luxurious feeling foam if you keep rubbing. It has more \"slip\" than Sunday Riley's Ceramic Slip cleanser if you've used that before. (If you use too little, it fails to foam.)\n\nIt feels really similar to my drugstore HG cleanser, Garnier SkinActive Gentle Sulfate-Free Cleanser initially. But that one doesn't create nice, thick feeling foam. That one cleans well but foams out to very small, non-substantial foam. \n\n**COLOR:** A opaque, white gel. \n\n**SCENT:** A strong, glue-like smell? No masking fragrance. \n\n**RESULTS:** I'm not always a gel-cleanser type of gal, but I actually really enjoy using this cleanser. It really *does* feel MOIST after washing, like my initial assessment. I personally have not used a cleanser with that sort of after-feel before. As a dry-skinned person, I *really* like that!\n\nIt didn't end up drying me out. I found it a really nice, hydrating second cleanser. The only issue was the strong smell, but I have a sensitive nose. I prefer it to smell a little weird than it be loaded with fragrance, personally. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$17-20 /100ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Yes, I really like this cleanser and would not mind having it on my sink if it came in pretty packaging! I can find other cleansers that can do the job just fine, but if it was pretty and maybe came in a bigger size, I can definitely see myself repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M.\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Squalane, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Phospholipids, Ursolic Acid, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Bisabolol, Isoamyl Laurate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Tocopherol, Dimethoxymethyl Chromanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Picture of texture [here](https://imgur.com/EhE4aHM). A *very* thick, nourishing cream. A little hard to spread. Layered well with other things, cosmetically elegant.\n\n**COLOR:** White, opaque. \n\n**SCENT:** None. \n\n**RESULTS:** I have this MIGHTY NEED to try out as many ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/barrier repair creams as I can get my hands on. So I was REALLY excited to try this cream out. \n\nThis cream was really moisturizing and felt protective on the skin. However, I had to use quite a lot to moisturize my skin. So I ran out of it pretty fast. \n\nIt felt really good, but it failed to keep my skin completely flake-free under sunscreen & makeup and throughout the night by itself. \n\nBut **please** keep in mind that I have *incredibly* dry skin; My skin is an asshole and it's not enough to merely slug life with Vaseline/Aquaphor/CeraVe Healing ointment. It needs lots of humectants and lots of FATS & occlusives to keep it from feeling tight. (I have eczema-prone body skin as well and go through moisturizers by the bucketloads..)\n\nNone of these creams *by themselves* can prevent me from waking up to skin tighter-feeling than I'd like despite *slathering* them on: CeraVe cream & First Aid Beauty UR creams - *way* too light & matte, Atopalm MLE, Zeroid Intensive, Zeroid Oint-Cream (almost!), Real Barrier Extreme, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Cream, La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+ Baume, Udderly Smooth, etc. \n\nI have to layer multiple of these on in order to wake up to moisturized skin. The only ones applied by themselves that give me the same results as layering multiple on are Aveeno eczema therapy cream & Ceradan barrier repair cream so far.\n\n(I have a big review post coming up sometime in the future on all these but it's gonna take a while.\\^)\n\nI've seen other reviews saying how much this C.R.E.A.M. has helped their dry skin, so I think it should work well for most folks. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$45-55 / 50ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No, unless somehow they come out with an actual bucket-sized option for cheap lmao. \n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! I had a lot of fun trying this kit. The company's customer service was incredibly helpful and nice. I hope they can tweak and improve on some things and their actual release goes well!",

Haha. I tried a bunch of the zeroid products (oint cream, soothing cream, and 5% urea cream) and the oint-cream is my favorite for night time, urea for day, and the soothing cream is alright but has a stickier consistency that I don’t like as much. Would repurchase the other 2 probably but none of them made me go WOW. \n\nMeanwhile I’m still hoarding the tiny sample of the skinceuticals cream I got and it’s been my go-to whenever I get a random dry patch. So I might just have to pull the trigger on that...\n\nThank you for the great review!",

I used 2% sa from Paula's choice as a spot treatment before, and it's really good but it dried out my skin so much, this just works. I've even used this three times a day and it doesn't dry out my skin. This brings the pimple to a head so soon. I've been using this since Jan 27th and i placed the order on the cultbeauty website on 6th jan. I've gotten a lot of opportunity to use this as i get frequent hormonal acne. My skin is very sensitive, and this doesn't irritate my face at all. It's fragrance free. The price of this product is 591.18 rupees on cultbeauty and you get 15 ml of the product, which is very decent for a spot treatment. The texture is veryyy lightweight and it doesn't pill under sunscreens and absorbs very quickly. It is non greasy. The active ingredients are 1% salicylic acid and 2% sulphur and the hyaluronic acid (edit: and squalane) in it makes it non-drying i suppose. Btw don't worry, it does smell a little sulphury but it's not overpowering or noticeable. It's green out of the tube but doesn't leave a tint of any sort, it's invisible. I thought the green color was to help color correct any redness from acne, but it doesn't do that too.\n\nMy skin type: normal (sort of dry in the beginning of feb due to winters), acne prone and sensitive\n\nClimatic conditions: moderately humid (30% today)\nMy age: 18.5\n\nFull ingredients list: Water (Aqua/Eau), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Colloidal Sulfur, Glycerin, Succinic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Salicylic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Squalane, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dehydroacetic Acid, Malachite Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, CI 75810 (Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex).\n\nI use this after cleansing my face and before my moisturizer. I've used this on consecutive days too and no purging or irritation has occured. But please do patch test because everyone's skin is different. \n\nThis is definitely one of my favourite products ever and I'll definitely repurchase it and call it my holy grail product. I'd highly recommend it too.\n\nI think I've mentioned everything needed for a review but please mention anything that i have forgotten and feel free to ask any questions about this product.",

Like, the malachite extract that makes it green is apparently a mineral that has soothing effects, and as you said, the added hyaluronic acid (Edit: and squalane!). Non-drying spot treatments FTW! \n\nI'm going to stick to my occasional zinc oxide + honey water spot treatments, since tretinoin has handled my regular acne, but I think this product is really cool!",

I've tried mint and peach and prefer the mint. Great lip product and I've used a lot. Some favorites being the Laneige Lip sleeping mask, Bite Agave Nectar Lip mask, Dr. Dan's Cortibalm, and C.O. Bigelow My Favorite Night Balm. This is one of the more affordable options out of the ones listed and it's amazing! Very very hydrating as someone who suffers with severely dry lips. It makes my lips feel like butter. Has some great ingredients like ceramides, green tea, panthenol. Very mild fragrances just enough to notice when applying but almost like it's unscented after it's on your lips for a few minutes. I'd say it's a medium consistency not too thick and not too thin just enough of a barrier. Really recommend if you've had trouble finding a great affordable everyday lip product. If you're having trouble finding it at a CVS you can buy it from peachandlily.com \n\nHere's the full ingredient list for anyone who's interested/has allergies:\nDiisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Ricinus Communis (castor) Seed Oil, C18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearoyl Stearate, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate/hexastearate/hex Arosinate, Helianthus Annuus (sunflower) Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Isostearate/dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer, Meadowfoam Delta-lactone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dextrin Palmitate, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Phytosteryl/isostearyl/cetyl/stearyl/b Ehenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Beeswax, Fragrance, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Panthenol, Persea Gratissima (avocado) Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide Np, Titanium Dioxide, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (wheat) Sprout Extract, Camellia Japonica Leaf Extract, Eruca Sativa Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Medicago Sativa (alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (broccoli) Sprout Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, Tocopherol, Blue 1 Lake (ci 42090), Yellow 5 Lake(ci 19140)",

I appreciate your listing out the ingredients too.😘\n\nThere seems to be some confusion about some of the ingredients, but you've likely heard of them already, just by different names:\n\n**Centella asiatica**. AKA as **Tiger Grass** or gotu kola, the medicinal plant **is the star of skin-soothing Cica creams,** and **madecassoside** is one of the primary, most active compounds in centella asiatica.\n\nThese ingredients are in some of the Dr Jart (and others) products that soothe the skin. BTW, **CosRX has a cica powder** that you can mix in with other products to customize them as you see fit. For example, you may not want all the ingredients that are in the base of a product because it contains irritants, fragrance of cause acne, so you could use something like squalene or hyalauonic acid as the base/carrier to mix with the cica powder which is great especially for sensitive and/or rosean skin. The jar is pretty tiny, but you don't need much.",

I’ve had GREAT results so far with my below routine using a BHA in the morning and an AHA at night. I also do a 40% lactic peel weekly and a few days after I use the Antec Mask + ACV if I feel like it.

I don't know if that means anything for your skin, I've just never seen it in foundation before.\n\nThe only ingredient I'd worry about is the silicone. Do you use primer too? Most people who use a silicone based foundation use a silicone based primer if they use a primer. That could potentially clog pores. Otherwise it seems fine ingredient wise, but someone else might know a little more about the other stuff.",

This one and Dr Jarts black label bb cream are the only two that didn't look flakey/cakey. However, Dr Jarts was almost too moisturizing and clogged my pores a bit. Most foundations/moisturizers break me out, but the CoverFx cream didn't. They do have lots of colors so I'd get some samples if I were you. It has amazing coverage and will eliminate need for concealer for most people. Powder tends to be drying but I haven't tried the one CoverFx makes.\n\nAlso, dusting powder on your face may irritate it more and increase redness, so cream applied with a disposable sponge may be more suitable for your skin.",

Took out Vitamin E (Tocophersolan). And added some plant extracts, [link](http://www.rahn-group.com/en/cosmetics/product/27/). Personally I don't like those supplier research documents, not every plant extract really works, and only well published research is relevant in my opinion.

    "body": "Hello :D I had a sunburn not long ago and I made a post asking what to do when you have a sunburn. \n\n—\n\nA lot of people said that Aloe Vera is great for sunburn so I brought this one : \n\nCiel d’Azur Labs - Pure Aloé Vera gel 98% \n\nI brought this one for 7,99€ I hope it works well, before buying I looked for rating online and a lot of peoples said that it was a good aloe Vera gel \n\nIngredients : Aloe Barbadensis leaf juice, xanthan gum, dehydroacetic acid, propanediol, benzyl alcohol, phytic acid, ascorbic acid, aqua.\n\n—\n\nAfter that I wanted to buy myself a water resistant sunscreen for the entire summer : \n\nLa Rosée, apricot oil sunscreen 50+ spf\n\nBrought this sunscreen for 20,99€. And this is the second time I’m purchasing it. \nI have sensitive skin and this one doesn’t sting ( even thought there’s perfume in it ? .. ) most of the time I take Korean sunscreen like Skin1004 centella sunscreen because this one is very oily and it peels a lot one the skin :( but for a summer sunscreen it’s cool 👌\n\nIngredients : Aqua (water), dicaprylyl carbonate, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, propanediol, decyl oleate, coco-caprylate/caprate, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, prunus armeniaca (apricot) kernel oil, ethylhexyl triazone, lactobacillus ferment, cetearyl glucoside, lactobacillus, potassium cetyl phosphate, triacontanyl pvp, parfum (fragrance), tocopherol, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, aloe barbadensis leaf juice powder, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, glycerin, hydrogenated vegetable glycerides citrate, xanthan gum, sorbitan olivate, ethylhexylglycerin, sodium hydroxide, panthenol, cetearyl alcohol, maltodextrin, citric acid.\n\n—\n\nAnd finally, some peoples said that :\n\nLa Roche posay Cicaplast B5+ balm \n\nWas nice for sunburn, ( brought for 10,99€ ) I will not lie I wanted to buy this balm before not for sunburn but because I swim a lot and being in contact with chlorine too much can be irritating sometimes so I wanted to try it, don’t know if the aloe Vera gel would be better or not but I will try and see if one is better than the other for me. \n\nIngredients : Aqua/ water/ eau, hydrogenated polyisobutene, dimethicone, glycerin, Butyrospermum parkii butter/ shea butter, panthenol, Zea mays starch/ corn starch, propanediol, butylene glycol, cetyl PEG/ PPG-10/ 1 dimethicone, trihydroxystearin, Centella asiatica leaf extract, Polymnia sonchifolia root juice, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, alpha-glucan oligosaccharide, silica, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium sulfate, mannose, capryloyl glyc,, caprylyl glycol, vitreoscilla ferment, citric acid, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate, lactobacillus, acetylated glycol stearate, maltodextrin, polyglyceryl-4 isostearate, tocopherol, pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate, CI 77891/ titanium dioxide",

Any ideas?\n\nIf you haven’t tried these candies before, (1) go try them!, and (2) here’s a description I found online: “Botan Rice Candy is a soft, chewy, slightly lemon-orange flavored candy with an outer layer of rice paper.”\n\nThe closest smell I’ve encountered is Alba Botanica acnedote face wash—and the smell was *really close*!!

That’s why people go nuts trying to figure out a routine, because you literally have to mix and match every product and hope they work together to ensure you’re getting results. And then if you have a reaction, or could easily cut one out because it’s not doing shit... you don’t even know which one it is because you’ve at that point— created a cocktail of Deciem.

Maybe it is but maybe it is not. I didn't include here because the information on turnip mustard oil is very limited.\n\n[Rose Hip Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/4064857.htm) - 1 oz / $5.65 \n\n[Sunflower Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3778998.htm) - 1 oz / $4.10\n\n[Avocado Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3777612.htm) - 2 oz / $4.35\n\n[Evening Primrose Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/7037279.htm) - 1 oz / $4.45 \n\n[Rose EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-q-r/rose-absolute-bulgaria.html) - 1/8 oz / $29 \n\n[Frankincense EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-e-g/frankincense-somalia.html) - 1/4 oz / $7\n\n[Chamomile EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-c-d/chamomile-german-blue.html) - 1/8 oz / $12 \n\n[Rosemary EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-q-r/rosemary-ct-verbenone-france-organic.html) - 1/4 oz / $10\n\nTOTAL: $76.55\n\nWith these ingredients, you can make at least five bottles of Quintessential serum for only $76. Essential oils will last you almost forever. Each serum probably has less than 20 drops of essential oils altogether. Noted: 1/8 oz essential oil equals 80 drops. 76.55 dollars divide into 5 bottles equal 15.13 dollars each. Which do you prefer to spend it on $175 or make yourself for $15. Why is it worth 175 dollars? It is because of branding, marketing and packaging. It actually has nothing to do with ingredients.\n\nAs for Epi-Peel, this will be your homework, please go to [Garden of Wisdom - raw ingredients](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/rawingredients.html) and [Eden Botanicals - essential oils](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-a-b.html). If that ingredient name doesn't sound familiar then [google it](https://www.google.com/). Try to figure it out yourself so that way you will learn and know which brand is a rip off or not.",

I don't understand why my scalp is still dry and itchy when it's supposed to soothe me with all the nourishing ingredients. I also have a bad habit of scalp picking due to severe anxiety (that I'm trying hard to cut), I know tea tree is drying as the small portion of spillage on my forehead is dry....    \n\n\n\nI used to use coconut oil as a hair mask but I stopped cause I can't stand the smell and it's so hard to get out too. I had to shampoo 3x and then my scalp would be dry again ugh.    \n\n\n\nI can't find the products recommended for dry sensitive scalp in my local drugstores so I buy products with similar ingredients cheap and accessible to me.    \n\n\n\nQuestion 1 : does this mean tea tree doesn't work for me? A lot of the recommended conditioners have all these ingredients of the petal fresh, this brand is really cheap and accessible to me too. Where did it go wrong?    \n\n\nQuestion 2 : the products recommendations page recommended tresemme naturals conditioner but It was discontinued and I read reviews that says it has to be used as a leave in and not a rinse conditioner. That baffled me! How do I know it's if a rinse or leave in?    \n\n   \n\nQuestion 3 : I plan on buying the sukin protein conditioner, is this okay?    \n\n\nWater (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract (Nettle), Arctium Lappa Root Extract (Burdock), Equisetum Arvense Extract (Horsetail), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil (Rose Hip), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Citrus Nobili   \n\nI got a lot of help last time.

Doesn't seem to have anything to do with sulfate, or the usual things people say to avoid. My only suggestion is to buy somewhere that takes returns with no questions! Or, buy cheap stuff so you don't go broke trying to figure it out. I spent years (and wayyyyy too much energy) trying to figure out which certain ingredients to avoid, and never figured it out. I have adverse reactions to lots of things, especially meds, so researching other peoples' opinions/reviews doesn't usually work for me....it's all trial and error. 😣",

    "body": "**Introduction**  \nTom Busby is a guy over at the forum [rosaceagroup.org](https://rosaceagroup.org/). He has researched skin conditions, mainly seborrheic dermatitis and malasezzia related skin conditions, for years and he has cured his life long condition through his homemade lotions and cleansers. Through the years he has shared his recipes and research on the forums, mainly in his own thread where he goes over different treatments and his own experiences: [Link](https://rosaceagroup.org/The_Rosacea_Forum/showthread.php?28667-Seborrheic-Dermatitis-amp-Folliculitis-Review-of-OTC-Treatments-for-Malassezia) The whole thread is worth a read\n\nNow that he has years of experimenting and experience behind him he doesn't believe his formulas will change, and he has also started selling his products. You can contact him through email or wait until he sets up his own website to sell his products, which he said will happen in a couple of months.\n\nEach product cost 35$ + shipping. I've been using them for just over a week, not really long enough to write a proper review, so this is more of a first impressions post. I'll try to keep it pretty brief, so just ask questions below if you want to know anything.\n\n**The Lotion**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Caprylic/capric triglycerides, Niacinamide & dl-Panthenol (proVitamins), Glycerin, Olive Squalane oil, Cetearyl alcohol 30/70 NF (thickener), Sodium Hyaluronate, HMW, & Ceramide complex, (skin quality improve-ment), Ceteareth 20 & Glyceryl stearate (emulsifiers), Toco-phersolan & Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Climbazole (anti-fungal), Microcrystalline wax, OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, & Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nA ton of great ingredients, climbazole working as an antifungal and piroctone olamine working as an antifungal and also against demodex. No oils which malasezzia can metabolize and also a ton of other great ingredients for general skin improvement.\n\nThe lotion is a bit runny, which makes it very easy to spread across the face. It's a bit oily at first,  but it soaks great into the skin and dries pretty matte. It has no perfume, it smells a bit of alcohol. It isn't as moisturizing as for example cerave cream or other rich moisturizer, but it works great for my skin. Thick moisturizer makes my skin all shiny and breaks me out, this leaves my skin feeling like I am wearing nothing. I've tried dozens of moisturizers over the years, and even without thinking about the antifungals, this is probably the best moisturizer I've tried. I just need a little bit to cover my entire face and because of the large bottle this will probably last for months.\n\n**The shampoo**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Decyl glucoside, Cocobetaine, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium lauryol lactylate, (surfactants), Niacinamide and dl-Panthenol (pro-Vitamins), Olive Squalane oil, Sodium hyaluronate, HMW, and Ceramide complex, (skin quality improvement), Tocophersolan and Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Acrylates C10-30 cross-polymer, Climbazole (anti-fungal), Citric acid, Di-PPG-2 myreth-10 adipate (solubilizer), OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Methylene blue, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, and Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nThis also contains a ton of great ingredients and no bad oils. I just use it as a foaming facial cleanser. It foams up pretty well, and it has a low pH. Because it is a foaming cleanser it is a bit drying, so using it without the moisturizer is probably a bad idea.\n\n**How to use and results**  \nReading Tom's posts at the forums he has some guidelines on how to use the products. Once a day I wet my face in the sink, then I foam up the cleanser and rub it into my face. Then i wait a few minutes and step into the shower and properly rinse it of. When i step out of the shower i tap-dry my face and apply the lotion on my face.\n\nFrom the first day my face started to shed dead skin. A lot of white flakes appeared on the center of my face and beard area. This might sound worrying, but according to Tom this is great. He is an older guy, so it took him over 5 months for his skin to return to normal, but because I am pretty young I should expect faster results. My skin seems to get less flaky every day, and i just rub the flakes of with my fingers and apply more moisturizer if they are visible.\n\nMy skin is less red and the products also seem to work well for my acne. It remains to be seen how the products work long term, but right now I am happy to have a solid routine that should kill of the fungus on my face causing my seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0acvbn1a1721.jpg?width=3336&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d824cd13feea43386925fe49c5793cb62db4cb6c",

        "body": "Great thorough review SelectAge.\n\nI bought the lotion and shampoo at the same time as SelectAge (after SelectAges post here on /r/sebderm that Tom had started selling it) and have also been using it for a week. At first I noticed, just like SelectAge, my skin flaking but also my face turned red. But both of these symptoms are supposed to be good since it is a natural reaction for your skin as the skin is fighting the sebderm. After a couple of days my skin has gotten less and less red and flaky. \n\nI'm also pretty young (27) so I expect my skin to react faster than Tom's did. Also he added an ingredient since he used it that he thinks may make it 25% faster than it was for him.\n\nMy routine is just like SelectAge, I mostly use it for my face, but sometimes I use the shampoo for my hair/top body as well but I don't use it often enough to review how good it works on my scalp. It doesn't bug me as much as the sebderm on my face.\n\nAs SelectAge said, it is a good idea to use the shampoo as a cleanser before applying the moisturizer to thoroughly cleanse your skin before putting on the lotion.\n\nIt feels like I am just repeating everything SelectAge has said already, but I will also keep updating how it goes for me. Hopefully I will know for sure in just a month or two if it going in the right direction for me:)\n\nIf you are interested in this product I'd suggest you read up a lot on Tom's research and then contact Tom on either the forum or through his mail which I think is accessible through his post which is posted on 4th of december in the forum thread which SelectAge linked. He has a 'product information file' which he sent me so I'd suggest you ask Tom for it if you are interested. I don't want to share it here without asking Tom so I'd suggest you just ask Tom for it:)\n\nHopefully we'll both get better and better SelectAge *hopeful*",

        "body": "Small follow up to my treatment. According to Tom's research an increase in flaking is a reaction to the immune system responding to the fungus. When you start using an anti-fungal the immune system becomes aware of the fungal invaders and the symptoms flare up. After around 10 days of treatment the flaking is now very minimal, but redness, especially in the inner cheek region, which in first seemed to decrease, is now a bit worse. I have been kind of scrubbing the shampoo into my face, so I am going to try applying it a bit more gently in case the redness is just normal skin irritation.   \n\n\nI've experienced the same increase in redness when using antifungals like lotrimin ultra and terbinafine previously, so I am not really worried, and still optimistic about the treatment. The initial increase in flaking should be an indication that the product is working, an increase in redness is also to be expected. Curious to see if the redness will eventually fade.",

Ingredients are at the end of the post since this is one a lot of folks wouldn’t have come across. \n\nMy skin is probably really combo - tends to dry out / flake but oily and acne prone in t-zone, particularly hormonal acne. \n\nIf it’s relevant I’m using either ASAP daily facial cleanser or Elucent daily cleanser, and just been prescribed a 0.05% Tretinoin by my derm. \n\nThanks so much in advance!!!!\n\nIngredients for my old moisturiser: Aqua (water), Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, Borago officinalis \n(borage) seed oil, Cetyl alcohol, Glycerin, Sorbitan stearate, Triticum vulgare (wheat) germ oil, \nPolysorbate 60, Cetyl esters, Echinacea purpurea (echinacea) extract, Sodium lactate, Humulus \nlupulus (hops) extract, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, Panthenol, Tocopherol (vitamin \nE), Tocopheryl acetate, Beta-carotene, Sodium PCA, Urea, Niacinamide, Inositol, Glycine, \nParfum (fragrance), Fructose, Lactic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Ascorbyl palmitate, Glyceryl stearate, \nGlyceryl distearate, Citral, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, Alpha-isomethyl ionone, \nDehydroacetic acid, Benzoic acid, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

    "body": "I received a delivery from www.thestraywhisker.com.au the other day and among other stuff, there are a couple of lesser known soaps in there. Usually I avoid shaving soap with clay in them, but these two were interesting me and I couldn't resist.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nBoth soaps were used with a Plisson synthetic brush, a Mühle R41 head on a Maggard MR5 handle loaded with a Personna Red blade.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFirst off, [Local Gent Shaving Co. \"California Barber\"](https://i.imgur.com/u5nZ6dW.jpg)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPresentation: I received the \"export edition\" which is a shrink wrapped puck of soap with the DE razor blade shaped Local Gent logo stamped into one side, and the other side has a label like what you'd normally find on the lid of a jar. The label repeats the Local Gent logo, and the name of the scent is written in a 1950s/60s neon light style typeface. The jars and pucks available directly from the Local Gent website appear to have different (new?) labels. The soap is soft enough to smoosh into a shaving bowl or into an empty shaving soap jar, as I did.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nScent: Scent strength is on the lighter side of medium. California Barbershop is a clean scent that is light on powder and has an orange note in the top. It's a pleasant scent although if you already have a barbershop scent or two, perhaps it may not be unique enough to warrent a spot in your den.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPerformance: In the SOTD thread yesterday, I said it \"exploded into lather so quickly you'd think it was made of slick, white gunpowder\". The tallow based soap frothed up into a slippery and protective lather with no effort at all. Seriously, I picked up the brush, zoned out for a minute and before I knew it there was fantastic lather everywhere. Post shave it left my face feeling nourished and smooth.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIngredients: Water, Avocado Oil, Organic Tallow, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Stearic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide,Sodium Hydroxide, Bentonite Clay, Fragrance Oils.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPrice: AU$17.95 for 113g (4 Oz).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nOverall: I like this soap a lot. The performance is tops and the scent is pleasant and would work with a great deal of my post shaves, which is always worth taking into consideration. Would I buy their soap again? Yes, yes I would. The bang for your buck is pretty strong with this soap, there's a lot of bang for not too many bucks, which only makes it more appealing.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNext up, [Faena Natural Products \"Aeolica\"](http://i.imgur.com/cbhuVh1h.jpg)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPresentation: Faena shaving soap comes in a tall-ish white jar that looks to be around 70-80mm wide (around 3\"), it's a little narrower than the jars from LASSCo. A Plisson isn't the largest brush in the world and it still filled the jar up without a lot of room to load, so a wider jar would be ideal. The black label is subtle and the colour of the text on the label differs depending on the scent.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nScent: Aeolica's strength is fairly light, but gets a little stronger once lathered. The scent is described as having \"notes of anise and thyme\". The anise note isn't like a mouthful of black jelly beans, which I'm sure would turn some people off. Overall it is sweet, yet subdued and fairly inoffensive. Being fairly light it shouldn't interfere with your aftershave.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPerformance: Some of Faena's shaving soaps are available in a vegan base, but \"Aeolica\" is a tallow based soap and also includes lanolin. The soap whizzes up speedily into terrific quality lather that has plenty of slickness and cushion. The post shave feel is very good, my skin felt soft without feeling like it was coated with a film.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIngredients: Tallow, water, coconut oil, stearic acid, castor seed oil, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, glycerin, kaolin clay, dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol, parfum. (I assume the dehydroacetic acid is to prevent fungi and bacteria and the benzyl alcohol is a preservative.)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPrice: AU$31.95 for 120g.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nOverall: This soap gave a pleasant shave, and look forward to using it again. Having said that, it's quite expensive and unless they came out with a scent that I absolutely *must* get a hold of, I'd probably not buy another one. You could buy two Proraso soaps, or nearly two Local Gent soaps, or Shaver Heaven, or Haslinger, or B&M Latha, etc. The bang for your buck isn't great here, the performance *is* great, but the price is a little steep. I guess the € to AU$ exchange rate is to blame.",

I do this mostly out of curiosity since there are just too many ingredients that break me out and I learned not to take unnecessary risks. \n\nI was a bit excited when I realized they carry these pads and became more excited when I saw that they had decent ingredients, which are really similar to a point of being a dupe of Nip & Fab glycolic fix pads (only available online at 17€ in Germany). \n\nSo of course I bought one at **7€**, then came back and bought a few more at **3€**. Sadly I can't give you a full review right now, I haven't used them yet on my face because it's still healing from some irritation and my last acne flare up. But I've used them on other body parts and ohboi do they feel soft. I've used them 3-4 times with 4-5 days in between and they have gotten rid of almost all bumpiness and even lightened a bit an old burn scar. \n\nIf you are interested, I recommend going to Primark as soon as possible, their prices are marked down so they will probably disappear soon from existence. \n\n\nNow, to the info:\n\n**Name:** Skin perfecting resurfacing pads.\n\n**Description on package:** Disques exfoliants. Glycolic acid & Hyaluronic acid. Refines & purifies.\n\n**Quantity:** 60 pads\n\n**Price:** 7€ at first, 3€ now.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n> Aqua (water), glycerin, glycolic acid, sodium hydroxide, polysorbate 20, silicone quaternium-17, sodium benzoate, ethylhexylglycerin, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) extract, decyl glucoside, panthenol, disodium edta, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, benzoic acid, dehydroacetic acid.\n\n[On CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8754367767.html)\n\n[Picture of the product + other skincare thingies I bought](https://imgur.com/a/fOT9K3h)\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

I've been using superdrugs for about a year which are supposed to be a dupe for nip and fab (I haven't tried those), and these are nicer. They're slightly bigger and a fair bit softer. I saw slight results with superdrugs but more with these in the small amount of time I've been using them. \nMy skins super dry and dehydrated due to medication and these don't dry me out at all. \n\nI'm a bit bummed out that these seem to be being discontinued with the price dropping twice in a matter of weeks. I wish I'd bought more tbh! \n\nI actually really enjoy primark skincare. I'm using one of their moisturisers and it's lovely. Comes in a fancy glass jar and is £4! Seen a huge difference in my skin using that, it's quite rich and helps a lot with my dryness. Also adore their mists. I've been using their primer mist for ages, it's no frills but it's got glycerin in it. I use it as a finishing spray mainly to take away the look of powders. Their hydrating mist in the green bottle is nice too, I use that all over my body sometimes. \n\nIn a nutshell,  primark is doing very well with makeup/skincare, introducing ingredients like niacinamide  (sp?) And hyaluronic acid. Super impressed for the price.  Worth a try :)",

It didn't do much of anything.\n\nFrom what I learned talking to other people about it, they can't hurt and especially might be helpful as a supplement but not a primary driver for collagen remodeling. \n\nAlso, when you stop using the peptide product then the \"visible results\" go away. This is unlike one or two sessions of a real laser that your \"visible results\" are deeper results that stay with you without having to repeat those sessions over and over again.\n\nI use peptides now as a supplement skincare.

At least, not as much as my other full reviews. \n\nAnyway…let’s jump in!\n\nGlow Recipe Watermelon Glow Lip Pop:\n\nThis is a product that I picked up randomly to fulfill free shipping from Glow Recipe. I had taken quite a long break from lip care/lip products…I think about 6-8 months since I used/reviewed a lip mask or balm. This particular product from Glow Recipe did interest me because of the AHA in the formulation.\n\nThe Lip Pop comes in a tube style applicator that raises, lowers, and applies like a lipstick. Glow Recipe claims this product can be used both as an everyday lip “treatment” but also as a primer to help lipstick last. \n\nFeatured ingredients includes Watermelon Seed Oil, Coconut Flower Sugar, Watermelon Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, and some mild forms of AHA. Colorants and fragrance are also used here to give the Watermelon Glow Lip Pop a pink hue and watermelon candy scent. \n\nAs a daily lip treatment…I didn’t find this product to be particularly effective. Right after application, the product does help to provide a softening effect and feels moisturizing…but the effect only lasts for about an hour for me. The AHA in the Lip Pop also didn’t seem to do much to create long lasting smoothness or eliminate dead skin from my lips.\n\nThe tint itself is very light and seems like it would be buildable as well depending on your preference. I have darker lips that hid the tint for the most part…but the overall effect gave a cosmetic glow/sheen to my lips that I liked.\n\nOverall, the Watermelon Glow Lip Pop seemed more like a cosmetic lip tint/glossy balm vs. a treatment product. Just not my style…and at $22.00 USD I’m not sure it should be anyone’s style. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Diisostearyl Malate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytostearyl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Polyethylene, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Jojoba Esters, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate/Hexastearate/Hexarosinate, Caprylyl Methicone, Trioctyldodecyl Citrate, Microcrystalline Wax/Cire Microcristalline, Silica Dimethyl Silyate, Octyldodecanol, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Coconut Flower Sugar, Ceresin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Glyceryl Behenate/Eicosadioate, Isostearic Acid, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Maltodextrin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Citric Acid, Titanium Dioxide, Propylene Glycol, Aqua/Water/Eau, Tocopherol, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Crataegus Monogyna Flower Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Viola Tricolor Extract, Red 27 (CI 45410:1), Red 7 Lake (CI15850:1), Red 6 (CI15850), Fragrance/Parfum\n\nWhere To Buy (Glow Recipe $22.00 USD): [https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/lip/products/watermelon-glow-lip-pop](https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/lip/products/watermelon-glow-lip-pop) \n\nJungle Botanics Ecru Clay Soap\n\nThis bar soap from Jungle Botanics is one that I picked up from Wishtrend in a Hydration To-Go Gift Set. The set itself was only $10.00 USD and came with The Ecru Clay Soap along with a bunch of samples and sheet masks. The offer was a really great deal and even though the bar soap had an expiration date of late August…I was still happy to add two sets to my cart.\n\nI was kind of skeptical that this product would be something I could use on my face. And, after confirming on the Wishtrend site that the pH of this bar soap is 8.5-9.5…I knew this would be a body product and not a face wash for me. \n\nFeatured ingredients include Coconut Oil, Kaolin Clay, Palm Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, and Shea Butter. I found the soap to not be too drying while also cleansing thoroughly. Perfectly fine…but nothing mind blowing.\n\nWhat I did love is the included soap “sock” thing that holds The Ecru Clay Bar Soap. The main reason I don’t usually go for bar soaps in the shower is that I can never find a place to store them that allows them to totally dry between uses. Now, I don’t have that problem!\n\nThe soap “sock” alone made the Hydration To-Go Gift Set worth it LOL…but for this product alone (at full price) Wishtrend is asking $24.00 USD. Yeah, that much for a bar of soap and a “sock”. \n\nUnless you can snag this product up elsewhere for much, much less…this one is a pass for sure. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Kaolin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Golden Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel(Argan) Oil, Amazon Clay, Centella Asiatica Extract, DL-αTocoperol\n\nWhere To Buy (Wishtrend $24.00 USD): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/the-ecru-clay-soap/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/the-ecru-clay-soap/)",

You can take a reference to the Acid Queen's tutorial which she used 20%. On the r/DIYBeauty sub, i roughly remember just sticking to 10% or less but of course actual industry formulation would be different. Jane Barber, the mod from Making Skincare fb group, recommended me once to use Ethoxydiglycol at 2.5% for normal uses, so with the LAA at 20%, i'd expect it to be much higher so that the penetration would be effective and as a replacement for water to reduce the rate of oxidation caused by water. That aside, i think you can ask the opinion of the people on ChemistCorner forum if you haven't. :)\n\n[https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/01/12/fun-with-diy-skinceuticals-dupe-vitamin-c-tutorial/](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/01/12/fun-with-diy-skinceuticals-dupe-vitamin-c-tutorial/)",

    "body": "So, I have thin, fine, slightly wavy (less wavy than 2A type, but not straight either, kind of wavy in patches), currently coloured (I started going grey at 21. I'm now 28 and going back and forth about whether I can deal with being noticeably grey at this age), between chin and shoulder length, crappy hair. Dry and greasy at the same time. Always coated with a fine layer of frizz. sometimes blow dry it, but usually air dry it.\n\nIt's always been crap. I have to wash it every day to stop it being greasy, but I have tried not to. On two occasions I've gone a couple of months washing it every other day, but it was still an oil-slick on day two by the end and I never had much luck with dry-shampoo.\n\nI'm now on day 4 of co-washing. I've also been keeping the shower water coolish. For the first couple of days I just used the conditioner I had as I didn't see any silicones in the ingredient list:\nhttp://www.boots.com/en/LOreal-Paris-Elvive-Nutri-Gloss-Shine-Conditioner-400ml_21752/\n\nBut for the past two days I've been using this one, as I didn't see any bad ingredients in it (I may have missed some): http://www.boots.com/en/Naked-Rescue-Conditioner-250ml_863348/\n\nI've also got the leave-in conditioner version of that product. \n\nI think my hair might be a bit shinier, and it's not in the slightest bit greasy on day one (I'm going to try leaving it a day on Sunday when I don't have to be at work looking professional) but it's also reeeeaaaaaalllly fluffy, fly away and static. This isn't necessarily something new, but it is a bit worse. Previously, I would have dumped in smoothing products, but everything I have contains silicones (and they never really helped that much anyway)\n\nI've found that even with just using the conditioner, it still leaves my hair 'squeaky clean' once it's rinsed, which suggests that it's still over cleaning my hair, right? Am I missing something in the ingredients? Should I go for the mildest product I can find? I'm certainly going to try washing (or rather conditioning as I won't be using shampoo) less frequently. Is this just an interim phase before my hair becomes amazing? Any ideas?\n\n*Edited to add the ingredients for the conditioner I'm using:\nAqua, Cetearyl alcohol, Brassicamidopropyl dimethylamine (derived from brassicacae oil), Olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, Butyrospermum parkii (shea) nut butter, Passion incarnata (passion) seed oil, Dicaprylyl ether, Glycerin, Lauryl Alcohol, Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein, Aspartic acid, Hydrxypropyl oxidized Starch PG-Trimonium Chloride, Starch hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, Sodium lactate, Sodium chloride, Parfum, Chlorphenesin, Urea, Citric acid, Coumarin, Linalool, Lactic acid.\n\nAnd the leave-in conditioner:\nAqua, Cetearyl alcohol, Polyquaternium-37, Hydrolyzed vegetable protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Brassicamidopropyl dimethylamine, Aspartic acid, Ceteareth-20, Dicaprylyl ether, Lauryl alcohol, Argania spinosa (Argan) oil, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea butter), Parfum, Tocopheryl acetate, Chlorphenesin, Benzyl alcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Coumarin, Linalool.",

At least, not as much as my other full reviews. \n\nAnyway…let’s jump in!\n\nGlow Recipe Watermelon Glow Lip Pop:\n\nThis is a product that I picked up randomly to fulfill free shipping from Glow Recipe. I had taken quite a long break from lip care/lip products…I think about 6-8 months since I used/reviewed a lip mask or balm. This particular product from Glow Recipe did interest me because of the AHA in the formulation.\n\nThe Lip Pop comes in a tube style applicator that raises, lowers, and applies like a lipstick. Glow Recipe claims this product can be used both as an everyday lip “treatment” but also as a primer to help lipstick last. \n\nFeatured ingredients includes Watermelon Seed Oil, Coconut Flower Sugar, Watermelon Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, and some mild forms of AHA. Colorants and fragrance are also used here to give the Watermelon Glow Lip Pop a pink hue and watermelon candy scent. \n\nAs a daily lip treatment…I didn’t find this product to be particularly effective. Right after application, the product does help to provide a softening effect and feels moisturizing…but the effect only lasts for about an hour for me. The AHA in the Lip Pop also didn’t seem to do much to create long lasting smoothness or eliminate dead skin from my lips.\n\nThe tint itself is very light and seems like it would be buildable as well depending on your preference. I have darker lips that hid the tint for the most part…but the overall effect gave a cosmetic glow/sheen to my lips that I liked.\n\nOverall, the Watermelon Glow Lip Pop seemed more like a cosmetic lip tint/glossy balm vs. a treatment product. Just not my style…and at $22.00 USD I’m not sure it should be anyone’s style. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Diisostearyl Malate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytostearyl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Polyethylene, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Jojoba Esters, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate/Hexastearate/Hexarosinate, Caprylyl Methicone, Trioctyldodecyl Citrate, Microcrystalline Wax/Cire Microcristalline, Silica Dimethyl Silyate, Octyldodecanol, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Coconut Flower Sugar, Ceresin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Glyceryl Behenate/Eicosadioate, Isostearic Acid, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Maltodextrin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Citric Acid, Titanium Dioxide, Propylene Glycol, Aqua/Water/Eau, Tocopherol, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Crataegus Monogyna Flower Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Viola Tricolor Extract, Red 27 (CI 45410:1), Red 7 Lake (CI15850:1), Red 6 (CI15850), Fragrance/Parfum\n\nWhere To Buy (Glow Recipe $22.00 USD): [https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/lip/products/watermelon-glow-lip-pop](https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/lip/products/watermelon-glow-lip-pop) \n\nJungle Botanics Ecru Clay Soap\n\nThis bar soap from Jungle Botanics is one that I picked up from Wishtrend in a Hydration To-Go Gift Set. The set itself was only $10.00 USD and came with The Ecru Clay Soap along with a bunch of samples and sheet masks. The offer was a really great deal and even though the bar soap had an expiration date of late August…I was still happy to add two sets to my cart.\n\nI was kind of skeptical that this product would be something I could use on my face. And, after confirming on the Wishtrend site that the pH of this bar soap is 8.5-9.5…I knew this would be a body product and not a face wash for me. \n\nFeatured ingredients include Coconut Oil, Kaolin Clay, Palm Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, and Shea Butter. I found the soap to not be too drying while also cleansing thoroughly. Perfectly fine…but nothing mind blowing.\n\nWhat I did love is the included soap “sock” thing that holds The Ecru Clay Bar Soap. The main reason I don’t usually go for bar soaps in the shower is that I can never find a place to store them that allows them to totally dry between uses. Now, I don’t have that problem!\n\nThe soap “sock” alone made the Hydration To-Go Gift Set worth it LOL…but for this product alone (at full price) Wishtrend is asking $24.00 USD. Yeah, that much for a bar of soap and a “sock”. \n\nUnless you can snag this product up elsewhere for much, much less…this one is a pass for sure. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Kaolin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Golden Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel(Argan) Oil, Amazon Clay, Centella Asiatica Extract, DL-αTocoperol\n\nWhere To Buy (Wishtrend $24.00 USD): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/the-ecru-clay-soap/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/the-ecru-clay-soap/)",

Maybe it is but maybe it is not. I didn't include here because the information on turnip mustard oil is very limited.\n\n[Rose Hip Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/4064857.htm) - 1 oz / $5.65 \n\n[Sunflower Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3778998.htm) - 1 oz / $4.10\n\n[Avocado Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3777612.htm) - 2 oz / $4.35\n\n[Evening Primrose Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/7037279.htm) - 1 oz / $4.45 \n\n[Rose EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-q-r/rose-absolute-bulgaria.html) - 1/8 oz / $29 \n\n[Frankincense EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-e-g/frankincense-somalia.html) - 1/4 oz / $7\n\n[Chamomile EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-c-d/chamomile-german-blue.html) - 1/8 oz / $12 \n\n[Rosemary EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-q-r/rosemary-ct-verbenone-france-organic.html) - 1/4 oz / $10\n\nTOTAL: $76.55\n\nWith these ingredients, you can make at least five bottles of Quintessential serum for only $76. Essential oils will last you almost forever. Each serum probably has less than 20 drops of essential oils altogether. Noted: 1/8 oz essential oil equals 80 drops. 76.55 dollars divide into 5 bottles equal 15.13 dollars each. Which do you prefer to spend it on $175 or make yourself for $15. Why is it worth 175 dollars? It is because of branding, marketing and packaging. It actually has nothing to do with ingredients.\n\nAs for Epi-Peel, this will be your homework, please go to [Garden of Wisdom - raw ingredients](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/rawingredients.html) and [Eden Botanicals - essential oils](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-a-b.html).

I used your ingredient checker to see if these products were okay and they were :).\n\nBut now i got this problem that after i wash my hair and use the conditioner my hair kinda feels waxy and heavy (for some reason its mostly at the back of the head) + my ends of my hair kinda feel brittle. Like there's something in it but i pay attention that i rinse everything out. But when i wash my hair it kinda sticks together and is difficult to rinse everything out but i really pay attention to it. I don't know why this is happening but it is really bothering me. \n\nCould this be that i am using conditioner now and never used it before? Or that i am using sulphate free shampoo which makes something build up in my hair? Because when i just used shampoo with sulphates i didn't had this problem. Or is this the way the hair should feel when using no sulphates and conditioner? Because i noticed that my hair is more wavier now then it was when i used sulphate shampoo and no conditioner? Or is it hard water build up? Because i have moderatly hard water.\n\nMy hair is not really curly (more wavy actually) but i didn't know where to post this question and i have been reading this reddit for the past few days and i am really impressed by the knowledge of this subreddit.

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI’m brand new to Reddit so I apologise if this post isn’t in the right place or is too long or needy.\n\nPlease help - I think I’ve been in a Google rabbit hole for the past 3 weeks now!\n\nI’m looking for a broad spectrum preservative. I’ve never used a preservative before, so any experience I have of making my own beauty products seems irrelevant as it really is a whole different practice it seems. I’ve never been against preservatives, I’ve just put it off as long as I could as I know I’m not scientifically-brained, haha.\n\nWhat I need - a broad spectrum preservative that’s very easy to use (as I’m no scientist). Ideally can be used in a range of products (from hair care, body lotions and lip balms to room sprays).\n\nI really want to avoid alcohol so don’t particularly want to try - Dehydroacetic Acid and Benzyl Alcohol / Phenoxyethanol. As well as Parabens - I would like to gift and know someone who is allergic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere’s an extract from the notes I’ve made so far in case this helps -\n\n* Optiphen - has Phenoxyethanol\n* Liquid Germal/Plus - Banned in UK, includes alcohol\n* Potassium sorbate -- Pros - Good all-round preservative. Food grade safe. -- Cons - In-vitro studies suggest that it is toxic to DNA and has a negative affect on immunity.\n* Leucidal Liquid - looks great but seems extortionately priced in comparison - is it really worth the extra £? -- Also, does it need to be used alongside another preservative (e.g.AMTicide® Coconut) for full strength?\n* Willow Bark Extract - contains Salicin, which the body metabolizes to create Salicylic acid. However, I also read that if used for more than 12 weeks you can experience side effects.\n* Vegecide - sounded great but seems impossible to get a hold on in England. Also read I would have to use hurdle technology.\n\nThe list could go on but I’m already conscious that I’ve rambled for too long as is.\n\nAny help and/or advice would be hugely appreciated!",

It is very pH dependant, with its affective-ness decreasing at certain pH levels.\n\nRegarding the Leucidal Liquid, yes- you will need to use AMTicide Coconut alongside (to prevent mould, fungus). I worked with Leucidal preservative for a few years, and I have to say that- I was never able to have any official testing done- but my formulas would always start to smell different (kinda yeasty) after around 3 months (though there was no change in appearance), which to me suggests failure of preservative. \n\nUnfortunately I don’t have the knowledge to be able to share thoughts on any of the other preservatives.",

You may be able to minimise your need for preservation with hurdle technology, careful packaging, and a low pH, allowing less effective preservatives to be used adequately. In the UK The Soap Kitchen sells various preservatives which might your needs.\n\nHere is a paper which covers the general theory of preservation: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326050075\\_Cosmetics\\_Preservation\\_A\\_Review\\_on\\_Present\\_Strategies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326050075_Cosmetics_Preservation_A_Review_on_Present_Strategies)\n\nAnd another one which describes the action of various brand name preservatives: [https://creative-developments.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Cosmetic-Preservation-2016.pdf](https://creative-developments.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Cosmetic-Preservation-2016.pdf)\n\nPlease note that without challenge testing it is impossible to verify a preservative system's efficacy - the mechanisms are so complex that it can't be reliably predicted from a theoretical standpoint. If you have no scientific background then challenge testing is *definitely* not something you should try to do yourself, it involves lots of growing deadly bacteria on petri dishes. There are places in the UK that will challenge test for you, but it costs several hundred pounds - so if you can't afford that or aren't willing to pay it then all you can do is follow manufacturer guidelines and good manufacturing practice.\n\nThe need for preservation reduces significantly with a non-aqueous product, so depending on what you're trying to make that might be a good option for you. :)",

Leucidal in general is fairly notorious for not being effective. Willow Bark extract isn't a preservative by itself, but at the usage rate for preservation boosting it isn't going to cause side effects, and it would possibly depend on the particular version of extract.\n\nI've been having a look at what you can get in the UK right now from fairly well known suppliers.\n\nI found phenoxyethanol, phenoxyethanol & ethylhexylglycerin, Naticide, premixed or individual sodium benzoate & potassium sorbate, Dehydroacetic acid & Benzyl alcohol, Gluconolactone & Sodium Benzoate, Spectrastat OEL, dermosoft/dermorganics 1388, Geoguard ECT\n\nThe most versatile/most information available options are probably phenoxyethanol & ethylhexylglycerin, and Phenoxyethanol & Caprylyl Glycol & Propylene Glycol (Saliguard PCG)\n\nMost of the options are not great for preserving anything challenging like plant extracts with high potential to grow mold, and all would require you to be careful with pH and temperature, at minimum. In this context, I wouldn't consider any of them broad spectrum or very easy to use.\n\nIn 2019, I would have suggested that you order a variety of preservatives, including something with parabens like Germaben II, from one of the European suppliers or the US/Canada or even from Trulux in Australia. I've come across a few UK hobbyists and that's what they've done. But right now because of shipping and everything else, I don't know if that's realistic.",

I see no pH adjusters, so that SA and lactic acid are not going to exfoliate.\n\nHawaiian face mask has limonene (a component of lavender oil which has some evidence in phototoxicity) and fragrance. Not sure how pineapple/papaya extract are in terms of being irritants. \n\nEven Advanced looks to be the best of the lot. Potential irritants are relegated to somewhere near the end of the list (fragrance is almost last which is great). The addition of several emollients and non-fragrant oils makes this a strange one though, as they hamper the absorbing effect of clay. If you have oily skin you probably won't find this to be effective, but for Normal/Dry it may be nice.",

Acid exfoliants need time to penetrate the skin in order to do their work.\n\nTo purchase acid exfoliants in the UK, you can try Paula's Choice UK (expensive), Forever Young Active Solutions (cheap), or Nip + Fab (mid-range), which is available in Boots and Superdrug.\n\nI use Korean products as I find they suit my skin best and are pretty good value: CosRX Blackhead Power Liquid for BHA and Whitehead Power Liquid for AHA (this is quite strong and not necessarily for beginners). They are around £7 each for around 3 months of product. There's a lot of info over on /r/AsianBeauty.\n\nIf you worry about sunlight, do you wear a high factor sunscreen every day? This is important regardless, but if you do start using acids it's absolutely essential. Asian sunscreens are believed to be higher quality in terms of sun protection, and sit more nicely on the skin than Western products. I use Biore Watery Essence, which is SPF 50+ PA++++, and you can buy it from Ebay and Amazon UK for around £7-10.\n\nPIH (acne scarring) can potentially be helped to heal with a Vitamin C serum, but honestly, sunscreen is your bff in the fight against scarring, at least to start with.\n\nWe sound like similar skin types, so feel free to ask me anything else! This is my routine, which is keeping my hormonal acne under control.

I used the All Bright serum (see AHA/ BHA mega review in the sidebar) and was underwhelmed.\n\nFurthermore the UV index is pretty low at present, low enough not to be useful for vitamin D production in the skin. I would be more concerned about getting enough bioavailable vitamin D in your diet since that and the long chain omega-3s also in oily fish are really important for skin health. Experts recommend up to four servings of oily fish a week.\n\nConsult your family doctor about the breakouts because the most effective acne fighting actives are on prescription. Some of those may necessitate vigilant use of a broad spectrum sunscreen. Do also check out our ingredients Wiki, particularly the entries on vitamin A, vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate) and niacinamide.",

I’d definitely lay off of your other actives (if you use any) until your skin heals fully!",

    "body": "My skin doesn't like carbomer, so aloe-shopping was a little exasperating. Eventually, I found one that was terrible and one that was great.\n\nI tried:\n\n**1) AloeLife skin gel.**\n*Ingredients: Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Barbadensis Juice Concentrate, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Allantoin, Phospholipid, Retinal (Vit. A), Panthenol, Niacinamide, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vit. C), Tocopherol Acetate (Vit. E), Gluconolactone, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Benzoate & Potassium Sorbate (food grade preservatices).*\n\nCame for the niacinamide, stayed for the Nothing. The texture was awful - it stuck to itself while wet and even more when dry, to the point of pilling up and forming scales and strings on my face. It also ended up making me feel drier than when I started, which is the opposite of what I wanted here. I ended up mixing tiny amounts of it into my facial oil, which was still pretty useless. The packaging was upsetting too - after squeezing it out, immediately separating it from the nozzle was very important, otherwise the suction of the bottle would pull it back in (and presumably contaminate the rest of it).\n\n**2) Alba botanica very emollient after sun 98% aloe vera gel**\n*Ingredients:  Aloe barbadensis leaf juice(1), aqua (water), glycerin, lactobacillus/arundinaria gigantea ferment filtrate, caesalpinia spinosa gum, camilla sinensis leaf extract(1), ginkgo biloba leaf extract(1), leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, pyrus malus (apple) fruit extract, cananga odarata flower oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, alcohol(1), gluconolactone, phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, terpineol, triethylcitrate, hexyl cinnamal. (1)Certified Organic Ingredient.*\n\nFigured I could deal with a 1% less aloe vera content. Came for the random ferments in there, stayed for the actual moisturizing. The packaging isn't great just because this is super runny - it would be a lot more suited to a pump of some kind. But it is very soothing and moisturizing, and I've been using it with a small amount of my oils as my main moisturizer.  A much better product (and a much cheaper one at the same time!)",

    "body": "[Nip+Fab Glycolic Fix Exfoliating Pads](http://www.nipandfab.com/shop/face_fixes/glycolic_fix/49)\n\n\nThe pads are one of the few AHA products available here in Canada. My skin gets easily irritated by physical exfoliation (it gets red, no breakouts) and so I decided to take the plunge into the world of chemical exfoliation. There are two positive reviews on these pads. My skin is dry (oh so dry). I also want to mention that my skin is not sensitive. I usually can try a mishmash of products. The worst that happens is getting a large whitehead if my skin doesn't agree with the product.\n\n\nThe product comes in a cute little tub, easy to store and stack. They recommend using it once or twice daily. I used it once every 3 days and used it 4 times total. The wipes are soaked through, you can snip them and use half. There are 60 pads (can be cut to make 120) in the tub that I got for $12.95.\n\nI liked the smell a lot. It didn't sting upon application but my skin did feel a bit tight. I waited 30 mins before applying my moisturizer and my skin was VERY tight by then.\n\nMy skin HATED it. I broke out severely. My forehead was covered in small red bumps. Several turned into angry pimples with heads. Some seem to be turning into cysts (growing under the skin and no head). My forehead was a massacre. The rest of my face didn't react at all. I only get pimples on my forehead so I am guessing that's why.\n\nI was using a variety of new products (was really excited with a haul and used more than one product at a time). I posted a long text about my struggles. [My original and full post ](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/24lgg3/a_before_and_after_that_shatters_my_self_esteem).\n\nI thought that it was the sunscreen. I dropped all new products except the wipes, and things only got worse. It's been 3 days since I stopped using them. My skin is thanking me.\n\n[Before introducing the pads](http://imgur.com/9BzioAh)\n\n[While using the pads](http://imgur.com/HFSmjCG)\n\n[2 days after stopping the pads and just using OCM, my LRP cleanser, and Argan oil moisturizer](http://imgur.com/qLTAmKF)\n\n\nI thought that I was purging because of the actives in the AHA. The wonderful people on this subreddit pointed out to me that it was irritated and inflamed and that means it isn't a purge. Just irritation.\n\n\nThe most likely culprit is denatured alcohol in the pads. After /u/ieatbugs told me it can destroy the acid mantle for some, I went through all my products and noticed that none of them have denatured alcohol so it very well might be the culprit.\n\n\nRemember, YMMV. These pads were terrible for me, but worked well for others. I'm just glad I haven't had a reason to leave the house other than groceries. **Finals!**\n\n\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Aqua, \n\n* Glycerin, \n\n* Glycolic Acid, \n\n* Polysorbate 20, \n\n* Sodium Hydroxide, \n\n* PEG-12 Dimethicone, \n\n* Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, \n\n* Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, \n\n* Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), \n\n* Disodium EDTA, \n\n* Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, \n\n* Panthenol, \n\n* Lactic Acid, \n\n* Parfum, \n\n* Limonene, \n\n* Ethylhexylglycerin, \n\n* Dehydroacetic Acid, \n\n* Sodium Hyaluronate, \n\n* Linalool, \n\n* Geraniol, \n\n* Citral.\n\n\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Smells nice\n\n* Good price\n\n* Didn't sting when applying it\n\n* You can cut the pads and double the number of uses!\n\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Destroyed my skin\n\n* Utterly destroyed it\n\n* I cried\n\n\n\n",

I never had an issue with products I ordered from Amazon but did have an issue with the last couple products I ordered directly from Jessicurl.\n\nThe product was turning a brown color and separating into a sticky, stringy mess.  I contacted customer service and they informed me that they changed one of the preservatives in the product from Germall (Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynul Butrlcarbamate) to Optiphen (Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol).  She said they had gotten complaints and have since changed back to the old formulation.  They offered to replace the product for free.\n\nI then received an e-mail from customer service announcing the issue with the new formulation and offering to replace any defective products.  I checked the bottle I ordered from Amazon and it had the old formulation which is probably why I haven't had any issues with those.\n\nJust wanted to let everyone know what ingredients to look out for in case you are having issues with the product.  I believe the Spiralicous Gel is currently out of stock on Jessicurl and should be back later this month but you can still order the old formulation from Amazon!

The pH is also said to be between 4-4.5 which i understand is too high for the acid to have any significant exfoliating ability. \n\nSo i was wondering why is it when I've tried so many things that these have the biggest difference for my skin. These are the ingredients: \n\nAqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral\n\nIs there anything out of the ordinary there that could cause this? also does glycolic acid have any benefits other than exfoliating? i.e at a higher pH? \n\nThanks!",

And even though ph of 4 is on the high side it's still up to 40% free acid at that point which is a fair amount! I can still see it having good effects. Plus, it's a humectant at any pH which means it's moisturizing your skin - that might have something to do with it. :)",

The Aura masque certainly added some color and does help the roots blend even if it doesn't fully cover grey.

    "body": "First of all, sorry if I give a bit too much information. Itchy scalp is a little bit gross when you go into the description of it, so sorry about that.\n\nOkay, so since I was very, very young (think one or two years old) I've had ridiculously sensitive skin. Eczema is constantly there, I have to banish scented soaps from my skincare routine, etc. etc. My scalp's usually been pretty alright, up until recently. \nA while ago, I think about last year around this time, I started getting a really itchy scalp. It was around my hairline in the middle of my head, in patches more than all over. I called it dandruff, though I'm not sure *what* it was, as I got small white flakes in my hair around the same time. I bought E45 shampoo, which (as far as I remember) stopped the itching and helped me cope with it while it cleared up. \nI don't remember my scalp being abnormally itchy over spring or summer, but late autumn this year it's got really bad again. A couple of weeks ago I noticed it getting steadily itchier, and unfortunately I'm guilty of scratching it more than I probably should, at one stage to the point of it bleeding slightly. Again, it's usually worst in one or two patches, but it's so horribly itchy that once or twice it's stopped me from sleeping properly until I either give up and scratch it or put moisturiser in the places where it's worst (which stops it for a short while but makes it necessary for me to wash my hair in the morning.) The other day I accidentally scratched it, and a yellowy scale-flake thing came off, which is (I think) the first time that's happened. This time around, E45 has done nothing for me. That might have something to do with the fact that I've been trying to cut out harsh cleansers from my usage and E45 shampoo has Sodium Myreth Sulfate in it. What I'm using at the moment is a shampoo called Child's Farm, which is in fact a baby shampoo that's been 'dermatologically approved' and 'paediatrician approved' and 'suitable for eczema' but it hasn't been doing much for me. It cleans my hair/scalp perfectly well, and for a while afterwards my scalp isn't itchy, but about midway into the day or the next day, my scalp's back to being itchy again. \n\nI'm really sick of having an itchy scalp, and I don't know if it's down to the cold/wet weather (it's been foggy and cold and rainy recently), too much of something in my diet, or just sensitive skin that is now affecting my scalp. I've heard of and can get Neutrogena T-Gel, but it's expensive and I don't want to try it unless I know it could make a difference. \n Has anyone out there gone through this and come out the other side? Is it just an awkward phase of itchiness or is there some magical thing that I haven't heard of that can bring it back to being healthy and itch-free again?\n\nIf anyone's curious, the ingredients in Child's Farm shampoo are as follows: Aqua, Sodium Coco-Sulfate,  Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Argan Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Parfum, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Lauryl Glucoside, Limonene, Lactic Acid, Sucrose Laurate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil*, Citric Acid, Alcohol, Amyl Cinnamal.\n\nEdit: wording",

        "body": "Seborrheic Dermatitis is the fancy tern for the dandruff spectrum, though it's usually just used for the severe side of the spectrum. It typically causes flakes and the bigger, more severe flakes in more severe cases are typically yellow and often greasy. It's very closely related to eczema to the point that eczema of the scalp is usually diagnosed as SD, and some people think they are completely the same disorder. Both are associated with an overgrowth of a particular microbe that is supposed to be on our skin. Its technically a fungus. The overgrowth irritates the skin and when the immune system goes after it, even more damage is done to the skin, which just lets the microbe overmultiply more. Ketoconazole shampoo (nizoral) is very good at attacking that particular fungus, as is monistat cream, but obviously ask your pharmacist or doctor because I'm not either of those things. Tea tree oil 5% in shampoo is also supposed to be very effective against that kind of microbe.",

Thoughts?\n\nAnything wrong with this routine or anything you'd recommend? I want one that's just easy to use, but still does good and smells good too - I just know if something doesn't smell good I won't use it. My skin isn't a fan of Shea butter or anything rose/geranium related (except for rose hip, that seems to make it happy).

So any alternative to shampoo or conditioner would be appreciated, and if it is a conditioner or shampoo at least one where its ingredients list is very small and naturally derived .",

        "body": "Hi! I have relied a lot on EWG and their website to learn about ingredients in the past. They also have a database of products if you want a list of shampoos and conditioners to look at. Chemical names in the ingredients can sound complicated and harmful, which is why I look for test results of those ingredients from Canada and the EU (both places are very cautious when it comes to the safety of ingredients).\n\nAlso, sometimes an ingredient has a chemical sounding name and then you learn that it's a fairly common substance (eg. Sodium chloride = salt). I like \"going down the rabbit hole\" when it comes to researching what's in my products, but when I can't be bothered, I like using Skincarisma's website. They have a great, basic ingredient analyzer that you copy and paste the ingredient list into.\n\nHope this helps!",

You can also post in the weekly help thread - it's stickied to the top of the sub every week! Here are our tops tips for avoiding peeling:\n\n- Make sure your skin is completely dry when you apply tretinoin. Wet skin increases absorption and flaking!\n- Make sure your routine is hydrating enough. Hydrating toners like those from Hada Labo can really help - but remember not to layer hyaluronic acid directly under tretinoin. HA increases absorption, which in the case of tretinoin can cause extreme irritation, peeling, and flaking. /r/asianbeauty has many product recs. \n- A good moisturizer is key. Vanicream Lite, and Cerave are popular options.\n- A konjac sponge is a very gentle form of physical exfoliation that can really help!\n- Vaseline or Aquaphor can also really help prevent dryness. Pat on a very thin layer **after your tret has completely dried** - don't slather it, and don't layer on top of wet tret, just apply a thin layer on top.\n- Oil cleansing can work for many as a way to gently remove the excess skin. Get an emulsifying oil cleanser that will wash off easily (Hada Labo has a great one).\n- Consider skipping a night of tret if you have lots of peeling. Yes that may slow down your progress by a few days but a damaged moisture barrier can take months to recover. Go slow. Skincare is a marathon. \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I use Tazarotene 0.05% gel every other night with azelaic acid 20% in the mornings (sometimes). My skin is naturally oily but the taz and winter weather makes me very very dry and dehydrated. My skin hates hyaluronic acid so i try to hydrate with glycerin etc. Ive also switched to using only micellar water and rinsing it in the mornings rather than cleansing and it helps (i think)\n\nI currently use micellar water to remove sunscreen & any makeup. Then use a water based cleanser. While its pretty gentle, i still find my skin gets really dry afterwards. So while im not a fan of true oil cleansers (dont like the feeling and too tedious for my depressed brain to do every night), i found that most ‘oil’ cleansers in my country are actually water based. Here’s one i have which has Aqua as the first ingredient and then some gentle ‘oily’ surfactants:\n\nAQUA, PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE, GLYCERIN, GLYCERYL OLEATE, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, NIACINAMIDE, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA ROOT EXTRACT, SODIUM LAURYL GLUCOSE CARBOXYLATE, LAURYL GLUCOSIDE, SODIUM PCA, SAPONARIA OFFICINALIS ROOT EXTRACT, PARFUM, SODIUM CITRATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, SORBIC ACID, BENZYL ALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nIts supposed to be a dupe for the Cerave Foaming Oil Cleanser or the one by LRP or Bioderma since the ingredients are almost the same. \n\nMy question is: can i use this as a primary cleanser at night after micellar water? Does anyone use the Cerave or LRP one as a sole cleanser?",

        "body": "I’m a bit confused by the notion of a water based oil cleanser, chemistry-wise. This seems contradictory. Your question gave me a few questions of my own, and I ended up going down an of interesting rabbit hole from your question… 😅\n\nSo short answer - the two products you list should be fine to use together as long as it’s not drying your skin out. I would tend to think it would be very drying, but nonetheless BETTER than your status quo routine regarding dry skin. So it’s very personal… I know for my skin I could not get away with either of these routines, but we’re not the same. I’d make sure to keep your moisturizer game strong either way.\n\n——————\n\nOkay a bit more nitty gritty now (& apologies if I repeat anything you know already). \n\n(1) just to be clear, micellar water IS considered a water-based cleanser as well. So you as-is have been using 2 water-based cleansers. This is why I said earlier switching to something like the cerave oil-based one you mentioned might be a bit gentler on your skin… water-based already strips away your natural skin’s oils. THAT BEING SAID, yes micellar water is a lot more gentle and since you were removing makeup with it, I don’t necessarily disagree with your thinking (for me it’s too abrasive, but again maybe not for you). \n\n(2) Also to clarify, the cerave cleanser you referenced IS an oil-based cleanser, from all indications I can see. I’m guessing that you may be seeing water as the first ingredient to (1) provide a phase for all those aqueous surfactants you mentioned and (2) perhaps those various oil-based ingredients, when added together, surpass in quantity the water present. Note here - I was going off the cerave ingredients I found on this website (https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/facial-cleansers/hydrating-foaming-oil-cleanser)\n\n(3) Just looking at the first few surfactants you listed, for instance, PEG-7[…] & coco-glucoside are water-soluble, while glycerol oleate is not by default (but is fairly dispersible apparently). I could go on but long story short sometimes those surfactants might look more oil-based than they actually are (& vice versa). I’ll spare you the nerdy chemistry for now but the science is super fascinating. \n\n(4) Given points 1&2, switching to 1st micellar, 2nd cerave-dupe, from 1st micellar, 2nd traditional water-based, would generally be less drying and therefore more calming. If you suspect though that leaving some of your skin’s natural oils might break you out, this switch might be more irritating in the acne department. \n\n(5) Completely a personal anecdote - I found micellar only in the PM, & rinsing with water only in the AM to work best for me. I also do wear spf & makeup most days. It sounds like my skin is a lot more fragile than yours though. \n\n\nPhew! Apologies for how long I let this get. Hopefully something here is helpful! :)",

It would be possible for a plastic bottle, but not a glass one.\n\nBesides, as u/22mikey1 pointed out, ingredients in cosmetics should be quite non-toxic anyways.\n\nIf you can apply it to your face daily, minuscule amounts in your coffee should be of no consequence.\n\nJust clean it and rinse it well, so that it doesn't leave a weird taste.",

I'm having this from time to time - I mean there are days, weeks in which I don't get flushing at all even after very big adrenaline rushes. If I do have them after some stressful event, the stinging redness disappears after 5-15 mins. Sometimes it stays a little longer but it's almost not visible and stinging sensation is also mild. It's somewhat itchy, but mostly stinging, almost burning in the peak moment. It's not like the whole face, more like some areas of it.

Just some cheese. Not sure if this was coincidence or not, but when I also drink some milk (like 20-40ml to coffee) and/or eat some natural yogurt I get these flushings more often, they're angrier, easier to trigger, and got them on the body as well - usually my chest, but today I got them on hands/forearms, and calves but not so angry as on the face/chest.\n\n1. What could be the cause of it? Should I be worried?\n2. I'm an allergic (mostly pollen), I have to take oral antihistamines from Feb/March to Sept/October, but I don't take them now - could it be some kind of allergy reaction that is triggered only by emotions/adrenaline?\n3. Or dust/mites? I even suspect air freshener. I ask my housemates to not use it (or if they have to, only just above the toilet, not in the whole room) but they usually do that anyway...\n4. Foldout/pillowcase? But as I'm side sleeper, I'd get it on my arm (rather than the chest) and on temples.\n5.

        "body": "Cheese and yogurt are developed through aging and fermentation -- both processes cause the histamine level in the food to skyrocket. Same for alcoholic beverages, sauerkraut, anything that ages and/or ferments. And some things, like alcoholic beverages, also trigger our bodies to release histamine, so wine and beer are double-whammies, histamine-wise...they are high in histamine & they trigger histamine release in our body. High-histamine foods can cause flushing and reactions in general in people who have histamine intolerance or mast cell issues. These foods can also trigger rosacea and other skin reactions. MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) often triggers skin reactions that can look like rosacea.\n\nWhen you tripped and almost dropped your laptop you experienced some stress, and that released histamine into your bloodstream, and your body reacted to that high histamine level with flushing.\n\nFlushing can be a symptom of MCAS. When I was flushing frequently (before I began treatment for MCAS), I had to get tested for carcinoid syndrome and pheochromocytoma. I was tested for those & I was negative for both of them, so that's how we knew my flushing was possibly originating from histamine issues\n\nI agree with starsign, you might want to talk to your allergist about immunological issues. All allergists double as immunologists, so if a person has a systemic reaction to histamine (released by the body and/or ingested in food & beverages), they can help you figure it out. Make sure you document all of these instances, and exactly how they transpired. That will help the immunologist witj their diagnostic process.\n\nAn experiment you can try us to go a week or two without high-histamine foods. Then after 2 or 3 wks reintegrate those foods back into your diet. If you start flushing again, that will tell you something.\n\nYou mentioned that sometimes the skin that is flushing might sting a little , or something like that. When I have a rosacea flare or hives, that's what my skin feels like. My rosacea can even produce a burning sensation. Rosacea and hives are also affected by histamine.\n\nAn immunologist might have you try taking higher doses of antihistamines (like folk with MCAS and chronic hives do) to see if that helps. That will help you & the doctor figure out if you need to manage your histamine levels with medications. I take very high doses of H1/H2 blockers, they keep me alive, plus I get Xolair injections once a month.\n\nKeep us posted and be careful...this wouldn't be a good time to drink alcoholic beverages...could cause a major reaction that might require a visit to the ER.",

So the cloudiness is coming from the insolubility of both of those. \n\nYou can TRY and mix with your solubilizers first, then add water to clear it up a bit. \n\nYou can also decrease the pH of the salicylic acid to be more effective.

However, if you don't want to bring the pH down or if you can't micro test, these preservatives are your best options.\n\nOther options available (in the US anyway) would include Suttocide A (Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate) or Biguanide.\n\nProbably a good idea to use some kind of chelator in it.

I feel like I have zero way to predict whether my scalp will like a shampoo or not; some with supposedly \"harsher\" ingredients work great for me and others that are \"gentler\" make me super dry and itchy! I have to stick to low-poo because my low-porosity, medium-thickness 2C hair gets weighed down really easily. I desperately want to experiment with new shampoos but I have no way of narrowing down which ones might work for me!!\n\nHere are some of the products I've tried, how my scalp liked them, and their ingredients.\n\nTHE BODY SHOP GINGER SHAMPOO - Somehow? this is the nicest of all the shampoos I've ever tried on my scalp?? I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm. I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky.

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\**Hydrolyzed Proteins*\n\n* Hydrolyzed Elastin, silk, keratin, collagen \n* Peptides (wheat, oat, soy...)\n* Amino acids (wheat, oat, soy) or glycine, alanine, proline, etc.\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein, i.e. keratin, silk, rice, soy)\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n*For Use In Humid Weather​*\n\n* Vegetable glycerin\n* ​Sorbitol\n\n*Plant Gels*\n\n* Panthenol\n* Flax Seed Gel\n* Okra Gel\n* Aloe Vera\n* Hydroxyethylcellulose\n* Pectin\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Guar Gum\n* Marshmallow Root\n* Slippery Elm​\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Soluble Silicones **Definition:** This ingredient coats the hair shaft to lock in moisture, reduce frizz, add slip, and give hair the coveted soft and silky feel. Soluble silicones can be washed out with non surfactant cleansers. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types.

My little keto heart leaps with joy!) and noticed they have what seems to be an in-house brand of skin care called Lacura. At my location I saw a day cream, night cream, and a hydrating moisturizer.\n\nI was interested, as I’ve never heard of the brand or seen it mentioned on this subreddit so far. Though I’m sure it has, lol. Obviously, very cheap skincare can be a little suspicious.\n\nFor $4.99 I decided to take a chance on the night cream. I’ve used it for 3 days now and my initial impression is that it’s kind of meh. It has a fragrance, which I personally think is pleasant but others may not care for or may be reactive to.  It kind of feels more like it’s sitting on top of my skin than sinking into it, but it’s not sticky or heavy feeling, which is nice. It doesn’t seem to be clogging my pores or causing any reactions, but it’s still pretty early to know for sure. \n\nTonight, I’m trying to take advantage of this “laying on top of” thing by layering it over my normal moisturizer (Elf Daily Hydration Moisturizer). Maybe it will act like a thinner Vaseline and really help lock it in? I hope so haha, otherwise I might not finish the jar. \n\nI’m wondering if anyone has any thoughts, opinions, or experiences with Lacura’s products. Are any of the other products worth a shot? Am I burning a hole in my face with this cheap night cream and should bin it immediately?\n\nFor reference, here’s the ingredients for the night cream: Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Phospholipids, Ubiquinone, Propylene Glycol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Retinol, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil Unsaponifiables, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Dimethicone, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Lecithin, Glyceryl Oleate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid.",

Hallstar also recommends using cetearyl, not cetyl alcohol. Go to Hallstar's website and look at their formulations. I'm about to try Olivem 1000 for the first time today, and I'm using almost the most simple formulation possible - 5% Olivem 1000 with 1% glyceryl stearate SE and a bit of glycol in water (and preservative).\n\nWay too much hydrosol, and it would be a waste of hydrosol because I don't think that the emulsion will be stable. If it even forms an emulsion, because Olivem 1000 doesn't seem to like hydrosols and may not like citrus in particular.\n\nUse a reliable preservative, not a delicate one that requires sterile everything and airless packaging and getting the pH perfect to have a hope in heck of working. I suspect you'd need a bit of a glycol in the water phase to boost that one enough to be effective with any amount of hydrosol. I recommend Liquid Germall plus or Germaben II, as unlike phenoxyethanol preservatives they won't destabilize or thin emulsions.\n\nStart with a simple formula from someone who knows what they're doing and gives very good instructions. Start with inexpensive ingredients. Start with an emulsifying system that is easy to use, not Olivem 1000.",

This is not the case in yours, maybe you mistyped some of the numbers? \n\n- You'll benefit from keeping it simple the first few times: it will allow you to get to know how the ingredients behave and avoid wasting precious and expensive materials in trials. \n\n- Once you get practise and understand how the simple formulations behave slowly build up from there using more and fancier ingredients. \n\n- Get to know your ingredients before you use them in your formulation: do you like their texture, feel, colour, smell, absorption rate? Do the oils and butters feel soft and light (rice), or thick and sticky (castor)?  Do they leave your skin shiny, oily, greasy, moisturized? \n\n- Mix the oils and butters at the wanted ratios and check the mix again neat on skin (not in lotion form, just the oils and butters mixed). How does the mix feel? \n\n- Identity from these characteristics what you like and want in your lotion. And if there's something you don't like you can swap or remove, then check again. \n\nIf you don't do all this you will not know what is more likely to cause an unwanted effect in your final lotion, making it more difficult to fine tune later, if needed.\n\nFor a light-ish lotion I would suggest specifically: \n- reduce the cetyl alcohol to 1%\n- use a lower % of butters and a higher one of oils while keeping the mixed total around 10 to 20%. For the ones you chose, for example: 2% to 3% of each butter, 5% to 10% rice, and 1% castor. \n- use around 25% of the oil/butter mix for your emulsifier (this is not always the case but works well as a starting guideline for olivem 1000). E.g. for a 20% total of oil/butters use 5% olivem 1000.\n- get a gum! (or equivalent water phase tickener). Using it at a low percentages will give you a beautiful effect in texture and stability. Even just a 0.2% will change your lotion into something better.",

This is the one I'm least worried about as it's basically just a blend of plant oils.\n\n**Superbalm 5g travel pot**\n\n>Gently softens and calms dry skin on hands, heels, elbows and lips and also helps condition nails and cuticles.\n\nAlso not really worried about this as I won't put it on my face, although I wonder if it'd do any good as a spot treatment.\n\n**Intensive Nourishing Treatment Mask 15ml tester**\n\n>hydrates and soothes parched, stressed and sensitive skin\n\nMore worried about this, don't want to upset my skin, ingredient list as follows:\nAqua (water), Talc, Cetearyl alcohol, Borago officinalis seed oil, Butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), Glycerin, PEG-20 stearate, Prunus armeniaca (apricot) kernel oil, Panthenol, Symphytum officinale leaf extract, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Parfum (fragrance), Propylparaben, Geraniol, Citric acid, Benzoic acid, Dehydroacetic acid, Citronellol.\n\n**Brightening Treatment Mask 15ml tester**\n\n>fast-acting mask instantly revitalises dull skin. It contains stimulating camphor oil and toning witch hazel to help give your skin a natural-looking radiance.\n\nSame as Nourishing mask, sceptical.\nIngredients:\nAqua (water), Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, Kaolin, Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) water, Cetearyl alcohol, Silt, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, Panthenol, Cetearyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 stearate, Cinnamomum camphora (camphor) bark oil, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum (fragrance), Sodium benzoate, Potassium sorbate, Methylparaben, Limonene, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Lactic acid, Hexyl cinnamal, Citric acid, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, Propylparaben, Citronellol, Butylphenyl methylpropional, Eugenol, Geraniol, Citral.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with these products, and has their anecdote to share?\n\nI will patch test the masks but I've patch tested before only to lead to a breakout once I put it all over my face.\n\nThanks xx",

I just wanted to check a couple of things as I'm aware this stuff can be quite dangerous if used in tandem with the wrong products etc.\n\nAs far as my understanding goes, my current night cream does contain some acids (here's the link to it: [https://www.boots.com/botanics-all-bright-hydrating-night-cream-50-ml-10231427](https://www.boots.com/botanics-all-bright-hydrating-night-cream-50-ml-10231427)) but I've also pulled the list here with the acid's I can identify put in bold:\n\n## Ingredients\n\nAqua (Water), Glycerin, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (Sweet almond) oil, Dimethicone, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetearyl olivate, Sorbitan olivate, Sodium polyacrylate,  Hibiscus sabdariffa flower extract, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan gum, Dimethicone crosspolymer, Caprylyl glycol, Parfum (Fragrance),  Sodium hyaluronate, Sodium benzoate, Citric acid,  Ethylhexylglycerin, Dipropylene glycol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl acetate, **Benzoic acid, Dehydroacetic acid.**\n\nIs this going to be safe for me to use this following the use of the BHA AHA peel, or do you guys recommend something different?I also have access to coconut oil, almond oil, and  'The Ordinary 100% Cold-Pressed Virgin Marula Oil' - would one of these be better?\n\nThank you ever so much for all your help in advance! :)",

    "body": "Hey, so I'm a male in my early 30s and I've only just started getting into skincare. I've been at it for a month. I know this isn't long but my results so far have been a little discouraging. The people I ask tell me that maybe it's a lack of sleep, a bad diet, lack of water, or that I need to see a derma.\n\nI want to believe it's purging but it could be the products I use. My plan is to stick to it for another month and then maybe start from scratch with the basics (cleanser, moisturiser) and slowly introduce the serums and acids and stuff afterwards. Yes, I know, that's how I should've started. But I figured I could start it all at once.\n\nThe frustrating part is that my skin seemed to be better before I even was using any products. Again, I hope this is just purging. So, here's my routine. I recently was able to acquire a sample of Vitamin C from a friend. Another friend was telling me that I should find something to \"dry out\" my face, like tea tree, or a physical exfoliator to address whiteheads... that my AHA/BHA peel might not be enough since it's chemical. Anyway, here it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n AM  \n• SNAILWHITE Whipp Soap  \n• Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion  \n• The Ordinary Buffet  \n• The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%   \n• The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Ha  \n• Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++  \n\n\nAM (Vitamin C) - Just started on this  \n• SNAILWHITE Whipp Soap  \n• Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion  \n• Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Serum  \n• The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Ha  \n• Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++  \n\n\nPM - I only retinoid when I feel like I can take it; new to it, maybe used it a total of three times over a month  \n• SNAILWHITE Whipp Soap  \n• Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion  \n• The Ordinary Buffet  \n• The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  \n• The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion  \n• The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Ha  \n\n\nPM (exfoliation) - Also only use when I feel my face can take it, might've used 3-4 times the whole month.  \n• SNAILWHITE Whipp Soap  \n• The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution  \n• Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion  \n• The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  \n• The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Ha \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I really did my research before getting all this stuff and I was virtually living on INCIdecoder trying to cover all the bases in terms of superstar actives. My skin is combination/normal to oily. I'll textbox all the ingredients which you can plug into INCIdecoder if that helps. Is the bottom line that I should just keep on at it and hope for the best, do all the rest of it in terms of diet and sleep and so on or is there something glaringly wrong about my regimen?\n\nAm I using too many products? I'm kind of like half-way through the niac. and the peptides, I realised I was applying too much... wild guess, but could the moisturiser be locking that in and causing adverse reactions? I actually stopped using sunflower oil for this reason, I felt like my face was simply too oily and it was inappropriate for my skin type.\n\nAnyway, thanks for any input you might have.

So you would absolutely have to reapply often to keep up the UVA protection and let's be honest, that's not very practicable for most of us in everyday life.",

        "body": "I’m going to direct you to [this excellent blog post: Protein 101.](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/protein-101-lots-of-basic-information.html) \n\nShort answer: a little protein in one or two products can be fine* for low porosity hair \n\nLong answer: low porosity hair can generally* benefit from a little protein. Hair is made of protein and protein can help with curl structure and strength (again read the blog post). The recommendation I’ve seen is people with low porosity hair can have a little protein in one or two products or do a protein treatment once a month. Best practice is to try adding a little protein to your routine and try it once or twice to see how your hair reacts then switch off to a non-protein product for a few washes to see how your hair reacts. My hair is low porosity and fine and I currently use protein in my deep conditioner and gel and it is a little too much on the protein side of the protein-moisture balance. So I bought a moisture-only deep conditioner and for a few weeks I’m going to see if alternating my protein DC and my new moisture DC will help balance my hair.\n\n*exceptions if your hair is protein sensitive \n\nMy advice: if your budget allows get two deep conditioners (one with protein, one with moisture) or look for samples and travel sizes to try out a few DCs without committing to a whole tub of product. \n\nOne cautionary note: if you go with your second deep conditioner, it has glycerin high on its list. Glycerin works best in a certain temperant range of temperature, so if you are in a location that is has cold, dry air right now that product could cause frizz depending on your routine.",
