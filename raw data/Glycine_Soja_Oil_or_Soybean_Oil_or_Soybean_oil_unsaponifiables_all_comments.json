This study didn't actually look at the effects of soybean oil in mice, but of oil/fat in general. A proper study would have the same balance of macro nutrients to determine if the lipid source is the problem (comparing it to other oils like coconut, peanut, canola, etc.).\n\nAlso, mice and rats aren't ideal for these kinds of studies. For instance, we know that fructose intake in humans induces insulin resistance, postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, increases blood pressure, and is a risk factor for fatty liver disease. This isn't true in rodents because they have high fructose resistance due to multiple factors like being able to produce their own vitamin C and having very low uric acid levels. To induce similar effects in mice, we need very large supraphysiological dose of fructose (we can actually induce insulin resistance and renal structural damage in mice with low levels of fructose by increasing their uric acid levels to be more similar to humans before giving them fructose).\n\nTL;DR: This study simply increased the amount of fat being given to the mice, saw negative effects, and blamed it on the soybean oil they used, not the increase in fat. Mice are also horrible models for human nutritional studies and the effects rarely carry over to human studies.",

Part of the problems with using turbines as the primary engine is they are slow to respond to throttle control and only efficiently operate in a narrow Rev range. Imagine a Tesla that you could fill the auxiliary tank with cheap corn oil, booze, diesel,  E-85, gasoline, Motor oil, what have you.  The turbine would be hooked to a generator and spin at the optimum speed for power and efficiency. The turbine could be as small as a shoebox, leaving room for noise and heat attenuation. Also, the turbine could be used for cabin heat while the generator is spinning, reducing the electrical draw needed for heat, contributing to further range and efficiency.  The same could be said for a Rotary motor, except you would have to settle just for Gasoline /e-85.",

        "body": "The emissions were actually decent, The problem was fuel consumption when compared to a similarly-performing engine. There was also a concern that a turbine would last way too long, which is true. Corporations wanted customers to buy a new car every five years or so \"planned obsolescence\" was a real thing that affected design decisions.\n\nThe fifty that were first produced were doled out to customers from varied locations and backgrounds. The people who absolutely loved them were those who lived in the far north where it snowed heavily, and the cold was a major concern.\n\nSome people had to park outside in the bitter cold, but let's just restrict ourselves to people who would put their new turbine car inside a garage. Few people have heated garages, so even inside a garage, lets think about a car in Minnesota that is at zero degrees F. A regular car would have a hard time starting, and even after it did start, it might take five minutes to fully warm up.\n\nThe comfort of the passengers is an understandable concern, but even if the passengers are bundled up in parkas, a warm engine means that the windows will remain defrosted while you drive. This is not a trivial concern, since a fogging-window on an extremely cold day can lead to a car wreck.\n\nThe turbine here would easily start in the absolute coldest weather, and then it would warm the cabin and windshield defogger in less than half a minute. Whether that feature is important to you or not, the people in the far north said that they would gladly give up a few MPG to get that.\n\nAnother major difference was that a turbine could be reasonably expected to last MANY more years than a conventional piston engine...while costing less to make. The automatic transmission would then be the most frequently-rebuilt item in that situation.\n\nIf the technology at the time allowed a turbine to be built that was half the size, the fuel consumption might have been equal.

    "body": "EDIT: \"Intermittent Fasting\" in the title of this thread should be replaced with \"Intermittent Caloric Restriction\" (creds to: u/Jiend).\n\nI wrote a review on some recent fitness/nutrition papers. I tried my best to write for the layman but also not oversimplifying anything. I originally wrote all of this on an external page which will not be linked here but for those who wish to see it, kindly DM me. Regardless, I hope you all learn something and enjoy reading this. This is all written for educational purposes so any discussion or comments within this thread are very encouraged! Also, if everything is far too wordy for you, I have included TL;DRs for each section.\n\nThe covered topics: The anabolic window, intermittent caloric restriction, protein supplementation, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and squat technique (chronological order).\n\nThe first paper that we will cover is a short one by Schoenfeld & Aragon (2018) in which they reviewed the literature on the “anabolic window” for protein intake after training. Short-term studies had conflicting results but a meta-analysis conducted by Schoenfeld, Aragon & Krieger (2013) actually showed a minor benefit to consuming protein immediately after a training bout in terms of muscle hypertrophy. However, after more analysis where they controlled for more variables, they found that this small benefit was more attributed to overall protein intake. This is because some studies did not match for daily protein intake between groups meaning that some groups were having a higher daily protein intake than some other groups (which is generally considered to be more important than intake timing).\n\nThis meta-analysis has what we call a “heterogeneity” in the literature used. This simply means that the papers pooled and analyzed together widely differed in methods, populations and outcomes. So amongst those papers, we could see different protein intakes, training and untrained individuals and some being matched and not matched for daily protein intake. The review highlighted a trial done by Schoenfeld, Aragon, Wilborn, Urbina, Hayward & Krieger (2017) where 21 trained participants exercised 3 times a week for 10 weeks while either being allocated to a group that consumed 25 grams of whey protein immediately before or after a training session. Hypertrophy was similar between groups but the dietary control in the study was questionable as subjects actually ate at a reported calorie intake that was lower than baseline when they were supposed to be bulking.\n\nIt is still up in the air as to whether there is any real benefit but all in all, the authors suggest that if there is any effect, it is likely very small. They also propose that a meal 3–4 hours before a workout is likely good enough as the anabolic response to a meal lasts up to 6 hours (Layman, 2004). 0.4/0.5 g/kg of protein intake pre or post exercise is also advised to be sufficient.\n\n**TL;DR:** There may be some advantage to eating protein immediately after a workout but it may be very small. More rigorous research needs to be conducted. Meals 3–4 hours before training and 0.4/0.5 g/kg of protein pre/post workout may yield adequate results.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nA randomized control trial studying the effects of intermittent caloric restriction (compared to a standard, continuous caloric restriction) on body composition and other bio markers in 136 men and women was recently published. Schübel et al. (2018) split all subjects into 3 groups. The first group did continuous caloric restriction where the daily caloric deficit was around 20%. The second group followed a 5:2 pattern for intermittent caloric restriction in which 2 non-consecutive days of the week consisted of a caloric deficit of 75%. The final group was a control group; a group with no advice to lose body mass.\n\nThe first 12 weeks of the study (intervention phase) had the subjects work closely with dietitians to help follow their allocated diet plans. This included face-to-face sessions as well bi-weekly phone calls. The following 12 weeks (maintenance phase) had no advice from any dietitians but the participants did receive motivational support. In the final 26 weeks (follow-up phase), the subjects received no help whatsoever. Scales and diaries were provided to everyone to help track and follow their diets.\n\nThe primary outcome chosen by the researchers was the expression (taking genetic information and turning it into a product) of 82 genes that are related to the pathophysiology of obesity. Other studied variables include body mass index, blood pressure, waist circumference, body fat, liver fat, diet compliance and quality of life.\n\nDuring the intervention phase, the intermittent caloric restriction group actually lost more body mass (-7.1%) compared to the continuous restriction group (-5.2%) but the p-value was just above significance (p=0.053). This just means that if were to repeat the experiment (assuming there is no difference between interventions and that results are obtained purely by chance), the chance of seeing a more extreme result is above a level that is considered safe. Anyways, after the 50 weeks, the percentage losses were a lot closer, -5.2% vs 4.9% for intermittent caloric restriction and continuous restriction respectively with no statistical significance. For the primary outcomes (gene expression), there was no difference. Between sub-groups like male vs female or overweight vs obese, there were no differences. There were no differences in biomarkers or quality of life.\n\nAn interesting finding was that the intermittent caloric restriction group had the worst compliance in the later weeks. From 49 participants, only 9 were doing 2 energy-restricted days per week at the final week. This may be reflected in the fact that the intermittent caloric restriction group had a higher mass re-gain after week 24 compared to the continuous restriction group. Despite this, there were never any significant differences in any body composition variables at any time point in the study. \n\n**TL;DR:** Intermittent caloric restriction is a valid method for weight loss but there does not seem to be a metabolic advantage from 5:2 intermittent caloric restriction over continuous restriction in overweight individuals. It may be harder to follow the intermittent caloric restriction diet for an extended period of time.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nThe next study was carried out amongst new recruits in the US army while doing their Initial Entry Training (IET). IET is basically where civilians learn the fundamentals of being a soldier and improve their fitness before moving on to become trained soldiers. The programme is known to be quite tough and part of this is due to the documented caloric deficit (~600kcals) that most of the recruits suffer from during training (McAdam, McGinnis, Ory, Young, Frugé, Roberts & Sefton, 2018). McAdam et al. (2018) sought to see if there was an effect from whey protein supplementation on body composition measures (body mass and skin folds) as well as fitness test results amongst 69 male recruits.\n\nThe investigation was done in a double-blinded fashion (both the subjects and the researchers did not know who was getting which intervention) and the intervention lasted 8 weeks. Two servings (293 kcal, 40g protein) of whey protein were given per day (morning and night). Another group received a carbohydrate placebo that was matched for calories. Dietary analysis was done through logs completed by subjects in week 1 and 9 on 3 non-consecutive days.\n\nBoth groups maintained about the same body mass and gained similar amounts of lean mass, however, there was a statistically significant, greater fat loss in the whey protein supplemented group with a large effect size (-4.6kg vs -2.7kg). An effect size is basically a numerical measure on how strong one variable affects another. It is generally categorized into small, medium or large effect sizes. In terms of fitness, the amount of sit-ups done in 2 minutes as well as the 2 mile run timing did not differ between groups despite seeing improvements in both groups. For push-ups, the whey protein group performed 7 more on average in 2 minutes (medium effect size).\n\n\nDespite having regimented meals and meal times, dietary control was an issue with this study. There was a documented ~150 daily kcal intake difference between groups favoring the whey protein group. Therefore, the results may be due to the higher kcal intake rather than the higher protein intake or it may be more of a combination. There was also a great difference between all the subjects in terms of training history as evidenced by the extreme variation in lean mass between recruits at baseline. Training history has an effect on bodily response to protein as well as fitness. Lastly, this study lacks a control group. Regardless of these problems, it is clear that the additional calories ingested by the recruits had a positive effect on their fitness. Perhaps such a dietary approach can be adopted by the U.S. army in the future.\n\n**TL;DR:** The whey protein supplemented group had more body fat loss and higher push-up counts compared to carbohydrate supplemented group consisting of young males. This study, however, contains a few shortcomings in design (no kcal/training history matching).\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nA review on omega-3 fatty acid (n-3PUFA) supplementation for sports performance was recently published (Philpott, Witward & Galloway, 2018). From the work of Smith et al. (2011), we see that n-3PUFA supplementation has the potential to increase muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates in response to protein intake. Muscle protein synthesis is the addition of muscle proteins to muscle, the building blocks of muscle. The main acids of discussion are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA). EPA and DHA is mostly derived from fish oils while ALA is more from plant-based oils like soybean oil. An in-vitro (experiments done in controlled environments like laboratories instead of in living organisms like humans) study by Kamolrat & Gray (2013) found that DHA has no effect on MPS while EPA does. However, these effects on MPS may be redundant because optimal protein intake likely saturates any amelioration in MPS.\n\nUnfortunately, no studies looking at the effects of n-3PUFA supplementation of muscle strength/hypertrophy in the young and athletic exist. Although, there is some evidence suggesting muscle strength/hypertrophy and performance benefits in older men and women(Smith, et al., 2015; Rodacki, et al., 2012). There is theory for n-3PUFAs to help with synthesizing mitochondria. The mitochondria are parts of a cell that have the role of producing energy for our body. However, only one study examined this relationship and while there was a positive correlation, it was conducted in obese subjects (Laiglesia et al., 2016). Therefore, the use of n-3PUFAs for improving endurance is largely still theoretical especially in the athletic population.\n\nThere is also some theory in n-3PUFAs having a positive effect on insulin sensitivity but it is mostly not understood. In a rodent study, increased expression of GLUT4 (protein which transports glucose to muscle, lowering blood glucose) was seen with n-3PUFA supplementation but any of this has yet to be seen in human experiments (Lanza, et al., 2013). Kawabata, Neya, Hamazaki, Watanabe, Kobayashi & Tsuji (2014) found reduced oxygen consumption with n-3PUFA supplementation in untrained, young males. This may be linked to insulin sensitivity theory as increased insulin sensitivity leads to more glycogen in muscles which would displace fat use for energy and less oxygen consumption as a result. This effect may not have such a considerable effect in sporting performance as Hingley, Macartney, Brown, McLennan, & Peoples (2017) found no improvement in time trial times, strength or average power with n-3PUFA use despite an observed reduction in oxygen consumption.\n\nn-3PUFAs have anti-inflammatory properties so it has been proposed that they can support the recovery process after sport/exercise. However, the literature shows equivocal results. Finally, there is interesting discussion as to whether or not n-3PUFAs can aid in the recovery from a concussion as substantial amounts of DHA can be found in the brain. Wang et al. (2013) showed that rats had better cognitive performance with n-3PUFAs compared with rats that had soybean oil. The closest human evidence to all this theory was obtained by Oliver et al. (2016) in which less concentrations of a biomarker for head trauma was seen in American football players who ingested n-3PUFAs.\n\n**TL;DR:** Omega 3 fatty acids have potential to improve muscle strength/hypertrophy, endurance, recovery and concussion recovery but much more evidence is needed before any recommendations can be made.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nDutra, Alex, Mota, Sales, Brown & Bottaro (2018) ran a randomized control study to evaluate the relationship between antioxidants and muscle strength, hypertrophy and fatigue. 42 young women participated in the study and they were separated into 3 groups. The first group ingested 1000mg of vitamin C and 400IU of vitamin E daily. The second group received a placebo and the last group was the control. Everyone followed a periodized training programme consisting of 2 upper body and 2 lower body exercises 2 times per week for 10 weeks.\n\nThere were no reported differences in lower body muscle thickness, fatigue or strength. Furthermore, only the placebo group showed an improvement over control in peak torque and total work done. This indicates that antioxidant supplementation has a negative effect on muscular performance. It is unknown as to why the researchers did not assess the same variables in the upper body. The use of a dynamometer as a measure of strength limits applicability to training as more specific measurements like 1RM bench press or squat would give more realistic results. Finally, there was little to no dietary control within this study.\n\n**TL;DR:** Antioxidant use was detrimental to muscular performance amongst young women.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nComfort, McMahon & Suchomel (2018) undertook a review in search of the optimum squat technique. They defined optimum technique as having the least injury risk, most muscle activation and most carry-over to athletic performance. In regards to safety, they noted that squats are generally safer for the knee ligaments when compared to other leg exercises like leg extensions, however, the strain on the posterior collateral ligament increases with squat depth (Zheng, Fleisig, Escamilla & Barrentine, 1998). Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) strain can also be minimized by keeping the heels on the ground likely due to less tibial displacement (your shinbone moving around) with the heels on the ground (Toutoungi, Lu, Leardini, Catani & O’Connor, 2000).\n\nSome people suggest to keep the knees behind the toes in the squat especially if you want to preserve knee joint health. While this does decrease the knee joint forces by 22%, it increases the hip joint forces by over 1000% and it may have negative effects on the lumbar spine due to a more forward trunk lean (Fry, A. C., Smith, J. C. & Schilling, B. K., 2003). One final point to make on injury risks is that using lighter loads for greater depth will not necessarily decrease the joint stress at the knee because the knee still has to withstand more force from the higher knee flexion angles as a result of increased squat depth.\n\nAs for squat depth, deep squats are better than 1/2 and 1/4 squats for strength and performances like jumping (Weiss, Andrew, Wood, Relyea & Melton, 2000; Hartmann, Wirth, Klusemann, Dalic, Matuschek & Schmidtbleicher, 2012). Part of these results were in conflict with a study done by Rhea et al. (2016) where sprints and jump performances were improved best in the 1/4 squat depth group when compared to those who did 1/2 depth or full depth squats. Bazyler, Sato, Wassinger, Lamont & Stone (2014) discovered that the addition of partial range of motion squats to full-depth squats over 7 weeks led to greater 1 rep-maximums against those who did only full-depth squats in trained men. However, this may simply just have to do with the increased volume as well as increased training intensity for those who did partial squats.\n\nDigressing to muscle activation, smith machine squats have been shown to decrease activation in a couple of the quadriceps muscles (Schwanbeck, Chilibeck & Binsted, 2009). Before continuing, it is important to discuss the relation of electromyography (EMG, recording electrical activity from muscles) to muscle strength/hypertrophy. Correlation with strength has been documented by Hof (1997). The correlation with hypertrophy is not perfect but it is strongly correlated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for measuring muscle activation and fMRI can adequately forecast muscle hypertrophy (Dickx, D’hooge, Cagnie, Deschepper, Verstraete & Danneels, 2010; Wakahara, Fukutani, Kawakami & Yanai, 2013).\n\nIn an EMG study run by Caterisano et al. (2002), the full squat was found to have had better activation in the glutes compared to parallel or partial squats. A more recent EMG experiment from Bryanton, Kennedy, Carey & Chiu (2012) discovered greater EMG responses in the knee extensors (quadriceps) with deeper squats but not in response to heavier loads. The glutes, however, responded more to heavier loads and deeper squats as well. This suggests the quadriceps can be “isolated” in a sense with low load, deep squats.\n\nFoot rotation has only been reported to have an effect on hip abductor activation (the smaller glute muscles that sit under the gluteus maximus) with external rotation (feet turned out) and this rotation may allow for greater depths to be achieved (Pereira, Leporace, Chagas, Furtado, Praxedes & Batista, 2010). Lastly, an increased stance width (beyond shoulder width) results in more glute and adductor longus (thigh muscle under the quads, moves leg towards body along the lateral plane) activation.\n\nIn the end, the authors recommend a squat with a “natural” stance width / foot rotation, heels on the floor, full depth (115–125 degrees of knee flexion), neutral spine and free movement of the knees (allowed to go over toes).\n\n**TL;DR:** Squats are fine for knee ligaments. Heels on floor = less ACL strain. Knees behind toes cause more hip joint stress. Deep squats generally better. Smith machine may have less activation of relevant muscles, greater depth has better activation, feet rotation does not have much of an effect and wider stance width can activate glutes more.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nBazyler, C.

Those people are NOT fasting, they are simply on a heavy caloric restriction on those 2 days (75%). Their diet is therefore simply a different kind of ICR, where instead of having a continuously lower caloric intake, they just do 5 days of maintenance eating, and 2 days of heavy dieting.\n\nThat is NOT fasting. If they weren't eating anything for those 2 days, then yeah, they'd be in a fasted state with everything it triggers. But they weren't.\n\nFeel free to correct me if I understood that wrong, but I read that study 1-2 weeks ago when it was posted in r/science and yup, I'm pretty sure the study itself didn't mention IF, it was just talking about ICR (Intermittent Caloric Restriction).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd let's not argue semantics either, when you say Intermittent Fasting, people generally understand it as a classic 16/8 or this kind of diet where you only eat for a limited period of time so that your body enters a state of \"fastedness\" on a regular basis.\n\nAnd on a side note for people who actually are doing IF: [https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/5-ways-to-screw-up-intermittent-fasting](https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/5-ways-to-screw-up-intermittent-fasting).

    "body": "# New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought\n\n**US Congress intends to regulate crypto on a level far deeper  than currently understood―They will:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Designate Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks as commodities and regulate their transactions accordingly;\n* Create legal uncertainty for all other crypto projects and ICOs by allowing them to be labeled as securities;\n* Ban the use of (unauthorized) stablecoins;\n* Introduce penalties for the use of mixers and privacy coins;\n* Rebrand smart-contracts that take longer than 24 hours to deliver as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly;\n* Re-define legal tender and change the way money is created by the Federal Reserve; and authorize the issuing of a digital USD of which all transactions are recorded;\n* Introduce foreign regulations into US law for all virtual asset service providers in the US (and with US clients). This would not be done to then never use it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In short: Congress wants to bring crypto-currencies under full oversight and control.**\n\nThese new regulations introduce massive regulatory burdens on existing projects, ban and criminalize current normal activities, restrain innovation and free enterprise, and even introduce a transparent central bank digital digital currency that redefines money as we know it!\n\nAccording to United States representative Don Beyer, congress should incorporate “digital assets into existing financial regulatory structures.”(1) As you will see, they intend to do just that.\n\nAnd it will change the way things are done for crypto forever…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <What This Post Is About_\n\nThis post provides an overview of the crypto legislation currently (September 2021) being put through US congress.\n\nIt does not just look at the proposed bills, but rather at the wide range of laws that are to be amended.\n\nOnce all the puzzle pieces are put together, the big picture reveals shockingly strict regulations of crypto and a complete overhaul of the idea of “money.” This could have serious effects not only on the crypto sector, but also on the financial system as a whole.\n\nBehind the excuses of preventing money laundering and ensuring investor protection, the use of crypto is transformed in something it was not supposed to be. Especially delicate is the fact that part of this legislation is drafted outside the US.\n\n***Disclaimer***\\*: This report provides a high-level overview of the US laws that are to be introduced/amended by two new bills. Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <What Is Going On?\n\nOn April 06, 2021, a “must pass” bill was introduced called the “Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act”(2) (“Infrastructure Bill”). It passed in the House of Representatives and, after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting requirements and obligations for record keeping.\n\nWhile this bill created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: “Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act” (3) (“Digital Asset Bill”).\n\nThis bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international crypto regulation into US law.\n\nThis article looks at each of these amendments…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Commodities or Securities?_\n\nThe main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:\n\n*“Not later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major digital assets.*\n\n***Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***\\*, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies\\* ***each of the top 25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii) highest daily average trading volume as—*\n\n*(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.”* (4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Interpretation:\n\n* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.\n* Services engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Commodities Regulation_\n\nThe Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times since then.(5) It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges.\n\nIn 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as commodities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Definition of “Commodity” Amended to Include Digital Asset:\n\nFirst and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:\n\n*“****The term “commodity” means*** *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool, wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal, cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****, and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles, except onions (as provided by section 13–1 of this title) and motion picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.”*(6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Digital Asset Definition\n\nNext, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Smart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures Contracts\n\nA sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could  decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated  exchanges.\n\nCurrently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *“eligible contract participants”* or *“eligible commercial entities”*  to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on  leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a  person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar  basis.(8)\n\nNext,  additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset  Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the  delivery takes longer than 24 hours:\n\n*“(ii)  Exceptions*\n\n*(III) a contract of sale that–*\n\n*(cc)  with respect to* ***digital assets***\\*, results in\\* ***actual delivery*** *(including  transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the  transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by  either-*\n\n*(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or*\n\n*(BB)  with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed  ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC  registered digital asset trade repository; or”* (9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Dodd-Frank Act and Market Transparency\n\nAfter  the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict  regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital  assets as well.\n\nThe definition of swaps, as provided by the  Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could  refer to any “agreement, contract or transaction” that “provides for any  purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the  occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event  or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or  commercial consequence.” (10)\n\n## Next, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:\n\n* Regulate  swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require  dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\n* Increase  transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by  requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges  or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market  place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.\n* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Digital Asset Trade Repository\n\nTo  meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity  Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository  to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the  correct market information:\n\n*“The  term ‘digital asset trade repository’ means any person that collects and  maintains information or records with respect to transactions or  positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of  digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties  (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off  chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized  recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a  private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such  ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator  seeks to aggregate/include ‘off chain’ transactions as well.”* (12)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Interpretation Commodities Regulations:\n\n* As  of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed  as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).\n* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be  subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of  livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory  uncertainty for various business models in the industry.\n* No  “trading on margin” is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done  by high-level investors called “eligible contract parties.” This could  perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC  markets.\n* Smart contracts  that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures  contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can  be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the  CFTC.(13)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Securities Regulations_\n\nIn  the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act.  Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the  trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.\n\n## Definition of “Security” Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:\n\nFirst  and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be  amended to include a “digital asset security” (and exclude “digital  assets”) in the definition of security:\n\n*“(10)* ***The term “security” means***  *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,  bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or  lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or  subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***\\*,  voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any  put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate  of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest  therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,  option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange  relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly  known as a “security”; or any certificate of interest or participation  in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or  right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;\\* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***\\*,  or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker’s acceptance which has a  maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months,  exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which  is likewise limited.”\\* (14)\n\n## Digital Asset Security Definition\n\nNext, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:\n\n*“(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘digital asset security’ means a digital asset that:*\n\n*(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:*\n\n*(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.*\n\n*(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.*\n\n*(III)  Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include  new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the  digital asset) of the issuer.*\n\n*(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer’s liquidation.*\n\n*(ii)  In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not  wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with  respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***\\*)  which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset,  issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including  other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service,  goods, or platform of the issuer.”\\* (15)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## What does it mean to be regulated as a security?\n\nInvesting in securities in the US is regulated to:\n\n*“protect  interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to  protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal  Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets  in such transactions.”* (16)\n\nRegulations  focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and  subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).\n\nThe goal  of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all  material information that an investor would need in order to make up his  or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must  create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with  copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the  business, including audited financial statements.\n\nNext, the  subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has  oversight. The Security Exchange Act section §78l(a) states:\n\n*“It  shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any  transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a  national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to  such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of  this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.”* (17)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Summary of Securities Regulations:\n\n* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.\n* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.\n* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.\n* When  a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases  (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.\n* US  Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to apply for “desecuritization.” (18)  The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a  network is decentralized? The investors? Weren’t they the ones supposed  to be protected in the first place?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Changing the Nature of Money_\n\nThese  regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only  changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is  created!\n\nAs a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US  Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary  instrument.(19)  However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to  specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as  legal tender.(20)  And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or  NCUA).(21)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Introducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)\n\nAfter  slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the  Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with  far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:\n\n*“(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****),  except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with  respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for  circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.”* (22)\n\nIn addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:\n\n*“Federal  reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to  Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter  set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any  other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition***  *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the  Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions***  *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be  obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender  and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal  reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department  of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia,  or at any Federal Reserve bank.”* (23)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Interpretations on the Future of Money:\n\n* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.\n* The  Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a  ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday  transactions in USD.\n* Digital  federal reserve notes will make the “recordation” of all transactions  possible. Did they use this word because “monitoring all transactions”  would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking  at them makes no sense.\n* These  amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve.  Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not “print money.”  It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24)  The private sector “creates” most of what we use as money by issuing  credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the  monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for  credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it  wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot  of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the  authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a  “digital USD” directly. It could change the entire structure of the  financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.\n* The  original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits  to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of  economic stress.(25)  But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be  based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how  much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be  distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be  handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment  has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This  deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside  the crypto-space as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US_\n\nThose  paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation  know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate  from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is  an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).\n\nIn March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26)  (“FATF Guidance”) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance  hasn’t been finalized, there are already a number of points directly  included in the Digital Asset Bill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Banning the use of Stablecoins\n\nSubchapter  I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code,  department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:\n\n*“(a) IN GENERAL.—Beginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).”*(27)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Criminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)\n\nThe  bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of  anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing  services.(28)  It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act  could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for  not more than five years, or both.(29)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Introduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US Law\n\nNext, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section  5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a  digital asset, or *“a digital representation of value that can be  digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or  investment purposes;”*(30)\n\nSo  far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their  relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of  Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States  Code:(31)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buzs5az1dro71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b1726f091d09a7749d85d8e44af6ea8f5e45b7d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVirtual  Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving  cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are  facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called “virtual  asset service providers,” or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill  defines a VASP:\n\n*“(A) means a person who—*\n\n*(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies*\n\n*(ii) exchanges between digital assets;*\n\n*(iii) transfers of digital assets;*\n\n*(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;*\n\n*(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and*\n\n*(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and*\n\n*(B) does not include any person who—*\n\n*(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;*\n\n*(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or*\n\n*(iii)  develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to  issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with  a digital asset.”* (32)\n\nThis  definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only  difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different  forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new  addition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## The Big Picture: Global Regulation\n\nThe logic  behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition  (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in  between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider  crypto-space can be applied at this level.\n\nFrom the latest FATF  Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be  deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of  “unhosted wallets,” the introduction of the “travel rule,” labeling  those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole  host of other measures. (33)\n\nOne  additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is  also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which  are available in the United States and to United States persons, have  to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located  outside the United States. (34)\n\n## Interpretation International Regulation in the US:\n\n* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.\n* The  FATF term “virtual asset service provider” (VASP) is introduced in the  US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto  projects.\n* After first being  in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced  cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of  their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.\n* It  is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently  discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted  wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce  to then never use.\n* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill_\n\nLast  August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a  section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:\n\n## Clarification of Definition of Broker\n\nIt  makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all  possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the  Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to  the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:\n\n*“(D)  any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly  providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf  of another person.”* (35)\n\n## Reporting of Digital Assets\n\nIn addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:\n\n*“any  digital representation of value which is recorded on a  cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology  as specified by the Secretary.”* (36)\n\n## Effective Date\n\nEffective after December 31, 2023.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Interpretation Infrastructure Bill\n\nCommotion about this bill was mainly due to the wide definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space,  including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg,  the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the  lines of the following:\n\n*“Other  firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market — from developers and  miners to hardware and software providers — won’t have any new  requirements, so long as they don’t also act as brokers, according to a  Treasury official”* (37)\n\nAt  a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally  feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on  miners due to the nature of the technology.\n\nIn this case perhaps it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and  isn’t included. Moreover, comments from “anonymous sources at the  treasury” do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all,  including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are needed.\n\n# <Sources_\n\nI added all 37 footnotes here, but the post become to long to post.

What it says:**\n\n**Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such.**\n\n**Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security; guidance will be issued by CFTC/SEC. Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.**\n\n**In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; (unauthorized) Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are to be prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for almost all crypto projects, possibly to facilitate more future regulations.**\n\n**Finally, the Federal Reserve gets shocking new powers to create and distribute a central bank digital currency (CBDC), of which all transactions are recorded.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: added links to the two bills\n\nEdit 2: added \"(unauthorized)\" to tld\n\nEdit 3: Folks concerned should focus on the bill’s sponsor Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia, as well as the leaders, members and official feeds (website, Twitter, etc) of the committees involved.   \n",

Of course rice husks are a waste product that is a pain to get rid of, and pine resin is a byproduct of paper manufacturing, but using soybean oil is expensive enough as a cooking oil without having Goodyear and other tire makers doubling or tripling the price of it so they can make tires.  \n\nI am also specifically going to say that using corn to make ethanol just so the farmers in Iowa are happy is total bullshit.  Do you know how much carbon is put in the air and how much water gets used to grow the corn and manufacture the alcohol that they then blend with gasoline which lowers fuel efficiency and complicates reblending for different local climates and different elevations?  So the fuel used in Denver has to be different in summer than in winter and the fuels used in Denver only work in Denver because of the altitude.  \n\nIn all we are going to huge expense both to consumers and to the environment just to keep a few farmers happy in Iowa because that is the first state to vote, so they know they can sink any candidate that wants to alter this whole ethanol thing.  And that is just one example of the mind bending waste and inefficiency we go to in order to please some farmers, now our tires will be made of cooking oil and pitch.  Fine; as long as they will go 200,000 miles because they would have to to make up for the environmental toll and the expense to consumers of using food to manufacture profits for kelptocrat corporations.",

But nevertheless this thread by a personal chef to a billionaire was kind of interesting including how to make this gourmet BLT \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1alzkuq/i_am_a_personal_chef_to_a_billionaire_ama/kpinvzu/\n\n\nBLT. If you read a lot of my responses you will see I bring it up a lot because it is my absolute favorite meal all things considered, primarily the simplicity of it and how everybody could make it.\n\nYou want a fresh bread that is thicker cut, if you don't want to Make your own bread that is totally fine, you can get something like the Sara Lee artisan white bread.\n\nTomatoes have to be in season, that's non-negotiable. You want to cut them fairly thick and then immediately dry them by setting them on paper towels and then flipping them to absorb the extra moisture. Next salt them and put them in a single layer in a colander. The salt will absorb into the tomatoes removing extra moisture but also tenderizing them even further. You want to wait until the last moment to put them on your sandwich to give them as much time as possible to be tenderized. You can also add black pepper to them or an Italian seasoning shortly before serving.\n\nThe lettuce has to be romaine or a traditional green leaf lettuce, absolutely no iceberg.\n\nThe bacon is better if you go to a butcher and have it extra thick cut, but otherwise you want to go for the thickest cut the grocery store will sell which will usually be in the shape of a slab, not where it's been cut and layered in a thin package so you can see each individual slice. This will look like a single slab of bacon with no visible cuts. Cook this low and slow. 280° for whatever time it normally takes, remembering that it will harden when it cools so you want it to be a little soft since you want it to be just at the edge of crispy when cooled.\n\nThe mayonnaise is better if you make it yourself of course, but really you just want to avoid a mayo that uses soybean oil. Sunflower oil is the best, so sir Kensington mayonnaise is by far your best option.\n\nToast the bread lightly, put the mayonnaise on a fairly thick layer on the top and a thin layer on the bottom, then use a fresh black pepper. Get yourself a good grinder and black Tellicherry peppercorns. Then a nice light coating of sea salt.\n\nBacon should be applied first with the tomatoes on top then the lettuce.\n\nThis will produce a BLT that will be so good it will ruin every other BLT You will ever find at a restaurant. I'm not even joking or trying to exaggerate here, every person I've ever made these for that gets used to them eventually complains about how every BLT the order is terrible in comparison. My husband used to order BLTs all the time at restaurants for lunch, now he never does because he's always disappointed. It's especially disappointing because of how simple it is to make a BLT this good. Doesn't require any real skill and everything you need can be purchased from a local grocery store other than the peppercorns which you can buy a 1 lb bag for for $12 off Amazon.",

Japanese has a more peachy/salmon color compared to the whitish USA one.\n2. Japanese is thicker texture and holds shape compared to the USA as its more watery and slumps down on itself.\n3. Totally different flavor! Japanese has a tang/kick -brightness to it while USA one is more eggy and blander.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: No they are not the same and ingredients matter.\n\nEdit: I have come to learn that Costco sells Kewpie that is manufactured by the same USA company but has different ingredient list which contains MSG! Thanks u/Anfini !\nI’m not going to buy a family size Kewpie to compare and instead I will take Anfini’s opinion to heart and believe it’s not great either.\n\nCostco ingredients: SOYBEAN OIL, EGG YOLKS, WATER, DISTILLED VINEGAR, SALT, RED WINE VINEGAR, APPLE CIDER VINEGAR, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, MUSTARD FLOUR, SUGAR, CALCIUM DISODIUM EDTA, NATURAL FLAVORS\n\nUSA ingredient: SOYBEAN OIL, EGG YOLKS, WATER, DISTILLED VINEGAR, SALT, SUGAR, MUSTARD FLOUR, RED WINE VINEGAR, YEAST EXTRACT, NATURAL FLAVORS\n\nJapan ingredient list: VEGETABLE OIL (CANOLA OIL, SOYBEAN OIL), EGG YOLK, VINEGAR, SALT, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, SPICE, NATURAL FLAVOR",

Yeast extract. Yet despite the no-MSG claim, yeast extract is one of the ingredients (including tomatoes and cheeses) in which MSG \"occurs naturally,\" according to the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration.\n\n\"While FDA requires that these products be listed on the ingredient panel, the agency does not require the label to also specify that they naturally contain MSG,\" reads the FDA web page on monosodium glutamate. \"However, foods with any ingredient that naturally contains MSG cannot claim 'No MSG' or 'No added MSG' on their packaging.\"\n\nAnd, indeed, the US Kewpie bottle label avoids making those claims. Asked to elaborate on his early email about the no-MSG claim, Dunseith said there was a distinction between naturally occuring monosodium glutamate, like yeast extract, and manufactured MSG.\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/ct-tasting-kewpie-made-in-usa-mayo-20170609-story.html",

    "body": "Today we are making a spicy snack from Sichuan. We call it Leng Chi Niu Rou(冷吃牛肉). It is crispy beef fried in spicy, flavorful chili oil. These little treats are so delicious that every time I think about it, my mouth is watering. I like to snack it when I am watching movies, with some cold drink. It just such a relaxing thing to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to watch the video, here is the link: [https://youtu.be/v2KanVGHFW8](https://youtu.be/v2KanVGHFW8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients For Cooking The Beef In The Water (**Serve 3-4 people**)**\n\n* 1.5 pounds of beef (brisket, round, chuck will work well for this recipe)\n* 2 tbsp of Chinese cooking wine\n* Few slices of ginger\n* 2 pieces of scallion\n* Enough water to cook the beef\n\n**Ingredients For The Spice Mix**\n\n* 3 to 20 pieces of red dry chilies (depending on your preference)\n* 2 pieces of bay leaves\n* 1 star anise\n* a small stick of cinnamon\n* 1/4 tsp of fennel seeds\n* 1/2 tsp of white peppercorn\n* 1 tbsp of Sichuan peppercorn\n* 1/2 of black cardamom\n* 1 tsp of cumin seed (grind half and leave the other half whole)\n* 2 tbsp of sesame seeds\n* 1 +1/2 tsp of salt\n* 1.5 tsp of sugar\n\n**Ingredients To Season The Oil**\n\n* 1 cup of oil to deep fry the beef\n* a bunch of scallions\n* 6 slices of ginger\n* half of a small size onion\n* 5 cloves of garlic\n\n**Others**\n\n* 1/4 cup of water as needed\n\n**INSTRUCTION**\n\n* Cut the beef into few big pieces. Make sure you cut with a small angle from the fiber direction. brisket.\n* Prepare a pot with 1 liter of water. Add the beef in along with 2 tbsp of Chinese cooking wine, few slices of ginger, 2 pieces of spring onion. Cover it and bring it to a boil. Use a sieve to skim all the blood crumbs. Turn the heat to low. Let it cook for 15 minutes.\n* While that is cooking, let’s make a spice mix. In a blender, add the following spices: a bunch of hot dried chilies, 2 pieces of bay leaves, 1 star anise, a small stick of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of fennel seeds, 1/2 tsp of white peppercorn, 1 tbsp of Sichuan peppercorn, 1/2 of a black cardamon, 1 tsp of cumin seeds (1 am only put in half of it, reserve the other half for later). Blend everything into a powder. Put it in a bowl, continue adding 2 tbsp of sesame seeds for some nutty taste, the other half of the cumin seed, 1.5 tsp of salt, 1.5 tsp of sugar. Mix it well and set aside. I love this spice mix. I also use it as a dry dip for hot pot meat; you can sprinkle it on BBQ skewers; mix it with some fried potatoes, or even for oven baked veggies. \n* 15 minutes later, the beef should be cooked through but a bit tough, which means you will need some force to stick the chopstick in. Take it out. Rains it under running water to cool it down. Slice it into 1/8 of an inch thick pieces. Then cut it strips. Let it sit in a sieve. Just to get rid of any excess water.\n* In a large wok, add in 1 cup of oil. I am using soybean oil. You can use any high smoke point oil such as canola or peanut oil. While it is still cold, add a bunch of green onion, 6 slices of ginger, a handful of onion slices, 5 cloves of garlic that I crushed it. Keep the flame on medium-low. They will season the oil as it gets hot. This is an important step to make your crispy chili beef taste so much better. Fry them for about 5-6 minutes. Some of the aromatics should be slightly crusty and golden. Take them out and discard it. Make sure there is nothing left in the oil or else it will affect the flavor.\n* Heat the oil to 370 F. Add in the well-drained beef. Keep flipping them so each piece cooks evenly. We will fry them for 5-6 minute in total. The beef should be brown on the outside, kind of like beef jerky. Now you can turn off the heat. Take out the beef. Pour out most of the oil. You can reuse it, don’t need to waste that.\n* I left about 1/4 of a cup of oil in the wok. Put the beef back in along with the spice mix. I will suggest you add it in batches so you can adjust the spicy level. I also pour in 1/4 cup of water. Because the salt and sugar, they don’t attach to oil. It is hard to get the sodium infused into the meat without the water. Stir everything together. Keep stirring and cooking it for another 3 minutes until all the water is gone. You can taste it to decide if you want the rest of the spice mixture in. Which I do. Give it a final stir, you can take it out. By the way, because I add the salt directly into the spice mixture, so if you use half of the spice mix, you will need to adjust the saltiness a little bit.\n* Now comes to the hardest part of this recipe. You have to let it sit in the fridge for 3 hours until it cools down. This dish tastes better when it is cold. Sprinkle some spring onion on it before serving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy your meal!

The consequences of a long-term vegan diet low on omega-3 are not fully known, but it's well known that omega-3 is essential for brain function, mental health, prevention of cognitive decline, heart health, etc.\n\nThis is perhaps one of the most comprehensive reviews of the available literature so far. \n\nSome points of the article:\n\n* **It’s highly recommended that vegans supplement EPA and DHA from algae.** \n* **Vegans had the lowest omega-3 levels compared to all other groups** (but meat eaters who don't often eat fish also have low levels, so this is not only a problem for vegans). \n* **Flaxseed oil supplementation did not increase DHA levels.**\n* **Microalgal oil supplements are a sufficient and viable source of DHA.**\n\n[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2021.1880364](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2021.1880364)\n\nA little lesson:\n\nThere are three types of Omega-3: ALA (flaxseed, chia, walnuts), DHA and EPA (algae and fish). Our bodies can covert only a small percentage of ALA (5-10%) into EPA, and even less into DHA. Conversion is very inefficient. In spite of that, we'll generally find the information that \"vegans will be fine with two tablespoons of freshly ground flaxseeds a day\" (only freshly ground in your mixer so it won't oxidize, and hydrated 5 minutes before so it won't stick to your guts) - the study shows that this information could be potentially misleading.\n\nOmega-6 can further hinder conversion, so we should limit consumption of omega 6 (corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, etc., fried and processed foods).\n\nGeneral guideline: about 250-500 mg combined EPA and DHA per day. We should still consume ALA, as it also has benefits.\n\nOmega-3 can also help [patients with migraine.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5937007/#:~:text=In%20a%20study%20conducted%20on,the%20duration%20of%20their%20headache) A few days ago I watched a documentary on German TV showing a doctor telling a girl that her episodes of migraine crisis could have increased because of her vegan diet lacking omega-3, so he recommended supplementation, as it has anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n...\n\nEdit\n\nFor people attacking veganism:\n\nAsk anyone: \"ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF ANIMAL CRUELTY?\" If the answer is \"yes\", you can be sure this person is either a psychopath or a clown (using that as a defense mechanism to tease and ridicule people who are trying to make them think rationally). Most humans go along with animal cruelty because it's cultural, not because it's rational, so they prefer not to think or be reminded about it. Humans have enough intelligence to explore the universe and atoms - we can use that same intelligence to stop exploiting animals. Science can help us.\n\n**There is no problem in supplementing. Good source of omega-3 EPA and DHA originates from algae. Guess how fish get that nutrient? We are smart enough to know we can go straight to the source and skip killing fish.** And guess what? Your meat is often artificially supplemented with B12 - again, vegans just skip the part of killing.\n\nFor vegans downvoting and being defensive:\n\nI understand you are afraid information like this can potentially scare people away and fuel opposers. But we need right information so more people will feel safe to turn vegans. We have to try to be more rational and less emotional. Adopting a religious defensive approach won't help veganism and animals, that's what really scares people away.\n\nIS THIS REALLY TRUE?\n\nObviously, as it is often for research, this information is not conclusive, as the article itself points out, you're bound to find opposing points. A poster shared [this not so recent study ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20861171/)saying our bodies can adapt when we become vegan and convert more ALA into EPA and DHA. Maybe that's true? But then we can find [more recent study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-nutritional-science/article/longchain-n3-pufa-in-vegetarian-women-a-metabolic-perspective/D5E77796216EE8D57DEFF1A18995B7B2) contradicting that.\n\nThis is an interesting video quoting and explaining an overview of the scientific literature on this matter. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awB\\_4v2iRJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awB_4v2iRJU)\n\nSo each one of us has to decide what to do.\n\n(If you have links to other major studies confirming or contradicting this, which have relevant information for the vegan community, I'll be glad to post here as footnote).\n\nIS IT THAT EXPENSIVE?\n\nI'm sharing my price list search for Amazon Italy. In Italy, it can be as low as 6.50 euros/month for 225 DHA + EPA daily, or €8.00/month for 350mg. Is that cheaper than fish?\n\nShopping tip: calculate price per month to reach minimum concentration or price per each 250mg, as the labels and ads can be very tricky!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krghohyh0lzd1.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3ccaba72b2743da1d2b50e84156f209779fa95",

Let me give an example.\n\nMost typical western omnivore diet doesn't have fish very often. How much DHA/EPA do you get from average serving of fish-based meal? That way we can determine how much Omega-3 average omnivore gets and how it compares to a vegan who gets it through daily conversion of ALA from nuts and seeds sources. Are both similarly deficient and would both benefit greatly from supplementation? Those average omnivores who rarely eat fish might not have optimal intake of Omega-3 but they don't seem to die to that (directly at least) so would it be safe to assume you wouldn't as a vegan either? If that's the case, optimal intake of Omega-3 is in category of optimization rather than being essential (like B12 for example) so we should have different prioritization of supplementation.\n\nAgain, I agree with your message but it's understandable that some people here interpret it as fear mongering because it puts such a huge emphasis on vegans being a high risk group while ignoring how typical western omnivores fare with Omega-3.",

Conclusions: Substantial differences in intakes and in sources of n–3 PUFAs existed between the dietary-habit groups, but the differences in status were smaller than expected, possibly because the precursor-product ratio was greater in non-fish-eaters than in fish-eaters, potentially indicating increased estimated conversion of ALA.",

    "body": "For context, I worked as a cook for nearly 3 years so I always offer to go grocery shopping, cook, and clean up while visiting my parents to show appreciation for them letting me stay at their home. I make the most dull and tame food I can conceive, but it still always leads to so many problems. \n\nWhen I started making a dish by sauteéing onions and garlic in olive oil, my Boomer mom made a whole production about how it “smelled up the whole house” and she “can’t breathe.” She put a Covid mask on as a result.\n\nI made a VERY basic chicken marinade with soy sauce (the kind of marinade that doesn’t overtly taste like soy sauce, but just has a pleasant savoriness to it) and my parents both agreed they didn’t like it because it tasted “weird.”\n\nI made a basic vinaigrette and tossed it with mixed greens. The faces they made when tasting the mildly acidic dressing (I added more maple syrup than usual to cater to them) looked like those compilations of babies trying their first lemon. My Boomer dad then walked to the fridge and pulled out one of those plastic containers of supermarket brand Ranch and put it on iceberg lettuce. The guy had the audacity to claim he was eating healthier and I just thought to myself that eating soybean oil, preservative laden-Ranch on top of crunchy water definitely is NOT healthy.\n\nThey live in California and are surrounded by numerous wonderful Mexican restaurants but still insist on making the taco kits with fluorescent shells and ground beef. It’s actually about the same price as just going to a local taqueria.\n\nThey live 10 minutes away from the Pacific Ocean and numerous local shops that sell seafood that was in the ocean earlier that day. They aren’t interested because seafood is “gross.”\n\nSimilarly, the region in which they live is one of the most fertile agricultural areas in the country so there are fantastic farmers markets. Nope, they’ll take the supermarket bags of iceberg lettuce or frozen vegetable medlies.\n\nI know I’m a bit of a food snob given my background of working in professional kitchens, but this is just out of control. They talk about how younger generations are “obnoxious” about food. That it always has to be something “weird” or “ethnic.” It’s just the Boomer bigotry and disdain for ANYTHING that’s remotely outside of their comfort zone that is so maddening. And with both of them being in their late 60’s and overweight, they really should be eating well. And because Boomers had everything so damn easy, they bought their house for a fraction of what it’s worth so they, as retired people, have all the time and financial resources to take advantage of the incredible food options of their area. But that would just be too “weird.” Like, sacrificing your own health and wellbeing to spite those millennial weirdos is a weird flex lol.\n\nDon’t get me started on their takes about immigrants or the “liberal Government” in California. Why is this generation like this? 😭\n\nAnyway, rant over. Please wish me luck for the rest of my visit lol.",

For 1, do you really think that anybody that makes over 100k a year would be on reddit bragging about how much they make and make it seem like it's nothing?!?! Bro, these are bored ass kids living with their parents wishing life was really that easy. \n\nSecondly, their stories don't match up. The only ones that justify the income live in high cost areas, where salaries are standard, meaning like someone who actually has degrees, years of experience, or both living in like LA or NY. And even then if their income was 100k to 150k it would be the equivalent of 50k to 100k of someone living somewhere like Georgia.\n\nWhen I first started reading these dumb ass posts, I started second guessing myself and went and did my research and found out that I was actually getting paid higher than 75% of the people with my same position, technical engineer with 12 years experience in my field, 26 years total work experience, and a bachelor's in electronics science.\n\nI get paid salary and work almost 40 hour weeks, live in florida and I'm not even at 90k, so nowhere near what some of these fools post for my position on these stupid posts. Besides, my wife works as well so her income helps out as well, and we live more than comfortable.\n\nYour income well above the national average, don't let the dickheads that fake the funk on reddit discourage you of what you make. Just know that's good income depending where you live.\n\nIdgaf, I call they bitch ass out all the time on bs when the shit don't make sense to me, lol. Just remember that there are apps that can make fake w2s and bank statements and most of these reddit posters are scammers looking for gullible people that feed into their BS to scam them. They lay the groundwork down by befriending the gullible ones and then get useful information out of them to drain their bank accounts or use their information to open credit lines or credit cards, basically phishing for information.",

However, **medications** [are not subject to these requirements.](https://www.verywellhealth.com/food-allergies-and-medications-82920) They must list their ingredients, but are not required to highlight allergens.\n\nWhy YSK: If you suffer from food allergies, you may neglect to verify whether a medication contains what you're allergic to. Be sure to read the full list of ingredients, not count on there being an allergen warning.\n\nExamples: Quite a few medications and supplements [contain soy lecithin or soybean oil.](https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/is-soy-in-supplements-good-or-bad-for-you/is-soy-good-or-bad/) For celiacs, [some medications contain gluten.](https://www.beyondceliac.org/living-with-celiac-disease/gluten-in-medication/) There are [many other examples](https://www.wellrx.com/news/unsafe-medications-for-patients-with-food-allergies/) as well.",

I was pleasantly surprised to find some items in Aldi's brand that are just as good: chips, their seltzer that I haven't gotten in a while but I will now because Polar downsized from 12 cans to 8 cans, their coffee, selection of meats, milk prices, etc.\n\nOne of the nicest finds I made: they carry a coffee creamer called \"Barissimo Delightfully Pure\" and it's just milk, cream and sugar unlike most out there that are loaded with extra preservatives, soybean oil and what not. This one is $3 whereas the Natural Bliss one in stores like Walmart is almost $6. It's just as good if not better, I got the Sweet Cream one.",

    "body": "So this week, I wanted to show you how to make a dish that maybe you’ve never heard of before - *Douhuafan*, Sichuan Tofu Rice.\n\nTofu rice is sort of humble dish at its core – it’s a meal that consists of some freshly-made savory Douhua (‘tofu pudding’ as it’s sometimes called in English, though this sort is a bit firmer than some others), white rice to eat it with, a special chili sauce to smother it all, and the tofu liquid served on the side as a soup. Sort of like Wonton Noodles in Guangdong or a New York-slice in NYC… it’s one of those local dishes that seems universally beloved, irrespective of what your upbringing was or how many zeros your bank balance has. Walk around Southern Sichuan, and you’re in Douhua country.\n\n[There was a paragraph here that kept hitting the spam filter, use your imagination lol]\n\nOf course, there’s a second challenge to making this dish: it’s a… challenging dish. We’ll be making tofu from scratch here, which isn’t too bad but’s definitely a project. And that chili sauce? Ain’t exactly ‘quick and easy’ either. It’s one of those things that, if you lived in Sichuan, would make almost zero sense to make at home. But you *don’t* live in Sichuan, and I doubt a Douhua restaurant will ever make it to your neighborhood… so here we are. It’s a project, but I think you owe it to yourself to at least *try* what (in my personal opinion) is the best tofu dish on the planet.\n\n[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/Pgm4W9LwzDg).\n\nThe way we’ll do this is split it up into three sections: first, how to make the tofu; second, how to make the chili sauce; and third, how to assemble the final meal/dipping sauce.\n\n**Ingredients, Douhua:**\n\n1.\t*Dried Soybeans (黄豆), 500g.* \n\n2.\t*Water, 4L.* We’re going to be working off a ratio of eight parts water to one part soybean.\n\n3.\t*Nigari (盐卤), 10g mixed with 20g of water.* Ok, so there’s two primary types of tofu coagulants – gypsum, which makes silken tofu and nigari, which makes… regular tofu. If you’ve ever had Douhua as a dessert, that type uses gypsum – we’ll be using nigari. For ease of international replication, in place of the traditional Sichuan nigari (called ‘danshui’, the old school type that’s the by-product of salt manufacturing), we opted for the Japanese sort. For reference our bag was ~46.5% magnesium chloride.\n\nNote: please don’t try to scale this recipe down if you can help it. You need a decent quantity of soymilk to make Douhua – it’s really tough to work with otherwise.\n\n**Process, Douhua:**\n\nHigh level overview first – to make tofu, first you make soymilk, then you add a coagulant, then you press it. \n\nCool. There’s a couple pieces of equipment to get in order before you get started though. First thing you’ll need is a very large wok (e.g. ours is 43cm) or a stock pot – woks are preferable as the sloped sides make it much easier to finagle around in. Second thing you need is a little basket to press your tofu.\n\n[This](https://i.imgur.com/ZCLMIWv.jpg) is what we used, and [this is what they generally use in Sichuan]() for this stuff. When we press the tofu, we’ll place the basket to the coagulated soy milk – the sinking of the basket will lightly press the tofu, the liquid’ll come through the cracks, and we can ladle out the excess water. Now of course, this isn’t some sort of high technology thing – feel free to get creative and use what you have around. Would a fine mesh sieve work? I think so, but it might be best to possibly remove the handle first. Also, notice how our basket was round, while the more proper basket’s flat. A flatter basket’ll more easily press the sides of the tofu – if you looked at our video, you’ll see that the left edge was a touch on the ugly side because we were having a devil of a time pressing it with that round basket.   \n\n1.\t*Thoroughly rinse the soybeans, place in a large bowl and add enough water to cover a couple inches about the soybeans. Soak overnight.* While I suspect this might be less of a problem in the West, first take a look at your soybeans and pick out any moldy beans. Rinse, then add enough water so that the soybeans can properly soak.\n\n2.\t*Blend the soybeans with the water; four minutes on high.* Use the smoothie setting if your blender has it. Note that unless you have some sort of massive industrial blends, you’ll likely need to do this in batches – we did three batches in all.\n\n3.\t*Transfer the soymilk to a large wok or stockpot. Set the flame to high.* Emphasis: large. You need a lot of soy milk in order to make tofu.\n\n4.\t*Bring the soymilk up to 100C, ladling the soymilk over any developing foam.* So it’s helpful to have an instant read here, because often soymilk’ll look like it’s boiling when it’s really just frothing. Note that if you happen to have one of those temp guns like we do, that’s not ideal for this task – while those are fine for measuring something like deep-frying temperature, they’re not really accurate enough here. Soybeans contains proteins called lectins which can cause food poisoning if not cooked out, to it’s really important that the temperature comes up to 100.\n\n5.\t*Swap the flame to medium high, and keep the soymilk boiling at 100C for 15 minutes.* Continue ladling the soymilk over the foam. If you can’t ladle it fast enough, feel free to scoop out some of the foam.\n\n6.\t*Strain the soymilk through a tofu or cheesecloth, a tofu bag is ideal.* Having a bag for this is recommended, as you’ve got… a lot of soymilk to work through. As you strain, toss it in a separate wok or pot.\n\n7.\t*Twist up the tofu bag or cheesecloth, and squeeze out any remaining liquid.* Be sure to try to get every last drop. If you’re a professional baker or tofu-maker and have heat-proof hands, just twist it and press. If not, using something like a heavy cast iron skillet to press the bag can be a nice approach.\n\n8.\t*Get the soymilk back up to ~90C.* Optimal temperature for working with nigari is between 85C and 90C. If you happened to be exceptionally quick with the straining and squeezing step, this won’t be a long wait. \n\n9.\t*Shut off the heat, and in a separate non-reactive bowl mix in 10g of the nigari with 20g of water.* \n\n10.\t*Spoon the nigari mixture in 5g at a time, 15g total. Mix it in with a spatula in a ‘slicing’ motion to avoid breaking any developing curds.* When mixing, the soymilk’ll start to congeal – be very careful not to break the curds. For a visual for how to stir it in, [check out 5:53 in the video](https://youtu.be/Pgm4W9LwzDg?t=5m53s) – apologies for the video link, a screen shot couldn’t really show the motion.\n\n11.\t*Now spoon in the nigari mixture 2g at a time, and mix it by simply spreading it over the surface. Add the nigari until you start to see little ‘popcorn kernel’ sized pieces of coagulated tofu, then stop.* At this point, you’ll start to feel some resistance with your spatula… you’re closing in, so go in 2g at a time and stop slicing into the milk. Now, the reason we’re doing this step by step is that each your soymilk might’ve reduced a bit differently than our soymilk – you’re going to have to go by eye here. Once [your soymilk looks a bit like this]( https://i.imgur.com/1S7T6np.jpg), stop.\n\n12.\t*Take some of the water from the clear areas and spoon it over the areas that haven’t separated cleanly yet, ~3 minutes.* So [as you can see here](https://i.imgur.com/iqXJlzB.jpg), some areas’ll be a bit clearer than others – clear areas equals ‘finished coagulating’. By spooning the liquid over to the less than coagulated areas, you’re Douhua’ll be a bit more even. You’ll be done once the spatula can lay on the tofu and no longer sink.\n\n13.\t*To press, lay your bamboo basket (or equivalent) on the tofu and let in sink. Spoon out ~80% of the liquid in the basket… moving it around the tofu.* Do this process until the basket stops sinking by itself, ~6-8 times. \n\n14.\t*Lightly press on the basket with about as much force as you’d massage your eyelid with, moving around the tofu, ~10 minutes.* At this point you don’t need to scoop out any more liquid, though feel free to scoop out some more if you want to keep it dryer.\n\n15.\t*Evaluate your tofu, then slice into ~16 pieces.* Ok, so confession time. You know how I said that the very left edge of our tofu didn’t form overly well due to our less than flat basket? We scooped out the extra floating chunks of tofu that just weren’t forming together over there – wasn’t much (maybe… 2% of the total tofu?), but we had YouTube thumbnails to make and all. Scooped them out and mixed them in with my scrambled eggs the next morning. Just full disclosure and all that – given that some of you might be trying to do this with a sieve (which would likely be even *more* challenging), it could be a decent way to mitigate some of the less than ideal pressing going on.\n\nAlternatively, while it wouldn’t be the same, if it’s your firm time making tofu pressing with a tofu press would make the job much easier. It wouldn’t be douhua anymore, but leaving it in the press for ~1 hour will make for soft tofu. Would still taste good with our chili sauce.\n\nWe left our tofu over a sort of Macguivered double boiler set-up to keep it warm before eating.   \n\n**Ingredients, Chili Paste:**\n\nQuick aside here – next time you’re at your local Chinese supermarket (if applicable), see if there’s a sauce available called ‘Xianglajiang’ (香辣酱) – at its core, that’s what this sauce is. If you have it available, awesome, you can use that in place of making your own. The bottled stuff is perfectly functional.\n\nThat said, homemade *is* best… and all the Douhua restaurants’ll also make their own as well. So if you can’t find it and have to make the stuff yourself, no worries – by making your own, you’re in the best kind of company.\n\n1.\t*Dried Chilis: Sichuan Erjingtiao (二荆条), Cayennes, or Arbols; 30g.* The specific variety of chilis we used here were Sichuan Erjingtiao chilis, but anything in the C. Annum cultivar between 15-40K SVU would do the trick. Will be reconstituted and pounded into a paste.\n\n2.\t*Chili Bean Paste (郫县豆瓣酱), 5 tbsp.* I.e. Pixian Doubanjiang. To be pounded together with the chilis.\n\n3.\t*Salt, ½ tsp.* To be pounded together with the chilis and chili bean paste.\n\n4.\t*Oil to fry the chili paste: peanut or soybean oil, ~½ cup.* After we make the paste, we’ll fry it until crisp and dry.\n\n5.\t*Spices: ½ tsp fennel seed (小茴香); 8 white cardamom pods (白蔻), preferably; 2 star anise (八角); 4g dried sand ginger (沙姜) -or- sub with dried galangal; 1 tsp white pepper powder (白胡椒粉).* These’ll all be ground up in a spice grinder. \n\n6.\t*Oil to fry the spices: peanut or soybean oil, ~½ cup.* So we’ll be frying up those ground spices, then adding them to the already-fried-til-crisp chilis, and finally leaving that to sit overnight. Full disclosure, this way of going about it is sort of a shortcut – traditionally in Sichuan they’d soak dried spices in cool oil for 4-5 days and *then* mix it in. You could go that route too, we just didn’t feel like it.\n\n**Process, Chili Sauce:**\n\n1.\t*Rinse and de-stem your chilis, then reconstitute with hot, boiled water for ~1 hour.* Keep the seeds in. \n\n2.\t*Strain, then in a mortar pound the chilis for ~10 minutes until looking pasty.* You could also use a food processor for this, I apologize for not knowing the timing there – we don’t own a food processor ourselves. [You want the chilis to be about this consistency](https://i.imgur.com/dYRsnmV.jpg), although perhaps a touch pastier as we felt we slightly underpounded these chilis.\n\n3.\t*Add in the salt and the chili bean paste, then pound for 5-10 minutes more. Set aside.* [This was our final consistency](https://i.imgur.com/96oI7D2.jpg), but again, you might want to go a touch finer here. \n\n4.\t*Grind the spices into a powder.* We used our coffee grinder which’s now been completely repurposed for spices haha.\n\n5.\t*Get a ~1/2 cup of peanut or soybean oil up to smoke point, then shut off the heat. Wait a minute or two to allow it come down to about 185C.*\n\n6.\t*Add in the ground spices. Give the spices a nice mix, then set it aside.* Once our chilis are completely fried dry, we’ll end up mixing this spice oil in with it. Quick aside that traditionally in Southern Sichuan they’d mix spiced in with cool oil, let those sit for 4-5 days, and then use that. What we did is basically a shortcut – feel free to go either route.\n\n7.\t*In a cool wok, add in the other half cup of peanut or soybean oil together with the chili paste, then turn the flame to medium low.* \n\n8.\t*Fry the chili paste over medium low heat until dry and crispy, about 20 minutes.* This process takes a while. Keep everything moving so it doesn’t burn, and after about ten minutes you should see that your chilis have deepened in color and’ve started to resemble more of a paste. As you continue to fry, you’ll get a real nice toasted smell from the chilis, and the oil’ll start to absorb. You’ll know you’re done once the chilis are all dry and crisp, and they begin to sound a bit like sandals on the beach when you press down on it with your spatula.\n\n9.\t*Add in the spice oil, mix, and place in a container. Let sit for at least 24 hours.* Or I guess at least a couple hours if you’re in a rush. This’ll make more than you need, but this chili sauce’s great. Feel free to use in anything and everything. \n\n**Ingredients to Assemble the final dipping sauce:** \n\n1.\t*Our homemade Chili sauce -or- Xianglajiang (香辣酱), 2 tsp per serving.* Again, feel free to use the Xianglajiang chili sauce if you’re aching for a shortcut.\n\n2.\t*Minced garlic, ~1/2 tsp.* So about two cloves’ worth over the four servings.\n\n3.\t*Chopped scallions (葱), ~1/2 tsp.* About a couple sprigs for the four servings.\n\n4.\t*Chopped cilantro (香菜), ~1/2 tsp.* About the same amount as the scallions.\n\n5.\t*Toasted white sesame seeds (烤香白芝麻), a sprinkle.* It’s always nice to have a batch of toasted sesame seeds handy, but if not… toast white sesame seeds in a dry wok or pan for ~5 minutes over medium low heat. Continuously stir and toss the seeds in order to prevent them from burning. You’ll know they’re done once you can hear them popping – they sound sort of like popcorn in the microwave, but muffled. Make a big batch so you can just have some toasted sesame seeds whenever you want some.\n\n6.\t*Mujiangzi oil (木姜子油) -or- lemongrass extract, a couple drops.* Ok, so there’s a weird ingredient we got here called ‘Mujiangzi’. It’s a concentrated oil made from the seeds of a certain variety of Litsea tree (Litsea Cubeba)… it’s got this real intense fragrance to it that’s quite similar to lemongrass. I’ve been able to find the essential oil for this stuff online (as ‘May Chang’ oil), but… I have no idea if that stuff’s food safe. You could use a bit of lemongrass extract in the same way, or alternatively play around with other ways to get a bit of lemongrass flavor in there (syrup perhaps? Making your own oil by pounding lemongrass and soaking in a neutral oil for a couple days?).\n\n7.\t*Seasoning for the sauce: ½ tsp salt, 1/2 tbsp light soy sauce (生抽), sprinkle of MSG (味精).* MSG helps balance the heat from dried chilis.\n\n**Process, Assembling the final sauce:**\n\nThere’s not real ‘process’ here, I suppose. Cut stuff up, pile everything into a small bowls for folks to mix together at the table.\n\nEach serving will also be about four pieces of tofu, however much white rice you feel like, and a small bowl of the liquid from making the tofu.\n\nTo eat, first thoroughly mix your little bowl of sauce. Then, grab some of your tofu and toss it on your rice. Smother the tofu with the chili sauce… and devour. To cut the spiciness, best eaten alongside some peanut milk, coconut milk, or an ice cold beer.",

    "body": "Soy is a nutritional powerhouse and a staple in many Asian diets. Tofu and its many variants, edamame, textured vegetable protein, soymilk, soybean oil, soy flour, and so on. The vast majority of soy produced goes to feeding cattle so they get big and strong and produce milk. [Only 7% is consumed by humans.\n](https://www.developmentaid.org/news-stream/post/165992/top-5-soybean-producing-countries)\n\nSoybean differ from other beans in that it has almost no starch content. This gives it an incredibly low glycemic index of 15. For context, pasta is around 55 while rice is around 70, because they are high in starch. However, the biggest selling point for soybeans is its incredible protein content, at 36%; this is 50% higher than lentils, and is the highest out of all legumes. On top of that, soy protein is \"complete\" for humans, though it's always good to mix up proteins from vegetable sources for a balanced amino acid profile.\n\nSoybeans are much higher in fat than other beans at 20%. However, it is mostly polyunsaturated & monounsaturated fats, including omega-6 and some omega-3. Sound familiar? They're the same \"healthy\" fats that are avocados' claim to fame as a health food.\n\nSoybean also stand out from other common legumes for its significantly higher calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc content. As far as beans go, none pack as much nutritional value as soy.\n\nThe US is the second largest producer of soy in the world, first being Brazil. Unfortunately, there is not a great demand for soy in the US, so despite the massive production, it is a niche product. Prices online are all quite ridiculous, ranging anywhere from $3-7 per pound. However, Asian grocery stores may carry these in bulk, and that's where they can become an incredibly cheap source of macronutrients for your diet. My local Asian grocer sells them for $0.99/lb.\n\nIf you have a pressure cooker, 20 minutes on high submerged in water cooks them perfectly. If just boiling, they'll need to be soaked beforehand. They have a mild flavor and creamy texture, and can be substituted into most dishes that call for some other variety of beans. They can also be blended into a thick shake as a meal replacement. Let's compare 90g of soybeans to one bottle of Soylent:\n\n . | Soybeans | Soylent\n---|---|----\nQuantity | 90g | 1 bottle\nCalories | 401 | 400\nCarbs | 18.8g | 37g\nProtein | 32.8g | 20g\nFat | 17.9g | 24g\n\nWhen equating the calories, Soylent has double the carbs, nearly 50% more fat, and only 60% of the protein. On top of that, one bottle costs $3.50 from the website *with* the subscription discount, while 90g of soybeans would cost me $0.20, so Soylent costs 17x more for worse macros. I know \"meal replacement\" drinks are low-hanging fruit when talking about eating cheap as they are never cost-effective, but the difference in nutrients is also much larger than one might expect - I was surprised myself looking up the data when writing this post.\n\nI blended up 100g of soybeans with water and drank it tonight. Homemade meal replacement shake. No additives, dirt cheap, filling, easy, low glycemic impact, can be easily carried to work, full of protein and healthy fats. Eating cheap and healthy doesn't have to be hard.\n\nThis message was not brought to you by Big Soy™",

    "body": "i've seen a lot of posts over the last few days requesting help with choosing oils for OCM, and since the responses are a bit repetitive, i decided to try to condense all the links and info in one big post!\n\nfor starters, check out [this list of comedogenicity ratings for oils](https://www.beneficialbotanicals.com/facts-figures/comedogenic-rating.html), and also the [oils and descriptions](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/oils.html) offered on GoW. GoW also offers sampler packs for specific skincare concerns. if you don't want to order online, whole foods and other ~healthy~ food stores carry brands like weleda and auracacia.\n\nhere is a quick overview of what i think are the most common/easiest to find oils! if you want to look into more exotic things (like meadowfoam seed or brazil nut or whatever), GoW is a great source of info. \n\n**mineral oil** - prob the best overall starter oil, because it is noncomedogenic (unlikely to clog pores or cause breakouts) and inert (will not react with anything in your skin). it's also very easy to find - you can use baby oil, or if you are sensitive to fragrance you can look for wood oil (snow river wood oil is ~$5 at bed bath & beyond). i don't recommend using mineral oil sold as a laxative because those are often thickened with tocopherols in a way that irritates or clogs a lot of people's skin.\n\n**other noncomedogenic oils** - sunflower, safflower, and hemp seed. these are good for acne-prone or easily clogged skin. keep in mind that if you have any contact allergies to plants, you want to be careful with oils from those plants just in case you have a reaction to the oils as well. \n\n**lighter oils** - grape seed, olive, sesame, jojoba, and apricot kernel. these are all slightly comedogenic, so patch test carefully. most of them tend to feel more moisturizing than noncomedogenic oils, with the exception of grape seed, which is somewhat astringent and can be a little drying.\n\n**richer oils** - almond and avocado. both of these have a slightly thicker/richer feel and tend to be very nourishing/moisturizing. again, these are slightly comedogenic, so patch test carefully. but these can be great for dry or dehydrated skin. unfortunately, due to their thicker texture, these oils are not as good at breaking up and quickly removing waterproof makeup as lighter oils.\n\n**highly comedogenic oils** - coconut oil, coconut butter, cocoa butter, mink oil, and soybean oil. these are not, like, guaranteed to break you out, but you need to be cautious if you have very acne-prone skin. \n\n\nthe following oils are used for specific skincare concerns:\n\n**castor oil** - has antibacterial properties, so it can help with acne. castor oil can be very drying, so you should dilute it to about 1-2 tbsp castor oil in 1 cup carrier oil. you can use that mixture either for ocm or to spot treat. do not use it undiluted to spot treat. i do not recommend using castor oil sold as a laxative for skincare purposes, for the same reasons mentioned in reference to mineral oil.\n\n**tea tree oil** - very good antibacterial, and can be super good for acne. tea tree oil is extremely drying/irritating, and you **should not ever use it undiluted!** undiluted tea tree oil can be extremely irritating, and even lead to chemical burns! you should dilute 1/4 tsp of tto in 1 cup of carrier oil, and you can use that mixture either for ocm or for a spot treatment. note that tea tree oil is usually sold as an essential oil, so it will usually be in a tiny bottle.\n\n**neem oil** - great for acne, and it is not drying, so you can use it undiluted as a spot treatment, or for ocm either alone or mixed with other carrier oils. word of caution - it smells super weird!\n\n**evening primrose oil** - this is supposedly really good for hormonal acne, but i have never personally tried it, and i can't find many sources to support this. however, there are [many,](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2133.1987.tb04085.x/abstract) [many](http://adc.bmj.com/content/75/6/494.abstract) sources supporting evening primrose oil as a very effective treatment for atopic dermatitis and eczema (although if you have either of those conditions, it would be best for you to be under the supervision of a derm or another medical professional, so talk to them before you start using anything new). as far as i know, it is fine to use this undiluted. \n\ngeneral notes on choosing oils:\n\n- be sure whatever you buy is 100% whatever oil and probably at least food grade. buzzwords like \"cold pressed,\" \"unrefined,\" etc, are *usually* good. for botanical oils, a lot of people think you should look for minimally processed or unrefined oils to ensure you get all the benefits from the oil. \n\n- when buying cooking oils (esp. relevant for olive, sunflower, and sesame oil), be very careful about what you buy and always patch test. there has been a lot of controversy lately about cooking oils being impure or diluted with other oils besides the one listed on the label, so be careful. [here](http://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/news-events/news/files/olive%20oil%20final%20071410%20.pdf) is the 2010 report about olive oil that has people in a fuss about this.\n\n- your safest option, although it may not be the cheapest or the most convenient, is to buy oils that are sold specifically for skincare or cosmetic use.\n\ni hope this was somewhat helpful!! remember that no one can tell you for sure whether or not something will work for you or cause a negative reaction, so it's ultimately up to you to do some research and choose what to put on your face. and always patch test all the oils you want to use individually before mixing or putting anything all over your face!! :)",

Oops. Now I use undiluted Tea Tree Oil to spot-treat (which you said never to do!) and it's worked well so far, since I'm not applying it for prolonged periods of time to any region (hence, spot-treating).\n\nI was thinking making the switch to Neem Oil from TTO as a spot-treatment.

To get a butter alternative (margarine), you take something along the lines of Crisco and add water and butter flavoring. Well, the original margarine formulations from the 19th century used beef fat rather than vegetable oil, which sounds pretty good to me. I wish you could still buy beef fat at a typical grocery store. Real butter is primarily fat from the same animal, though it comes from their milk rather than from rendering their fatty tissue.\n\nCrisco was originally hydrogenated cottonseed oil and it was the best for frying, or at least Colonel Sanders thought so. In an old B&W TV show appearance which you can find online, he specifically said that he fried his chicken in Crisco; *real* Crisco of course, which no longer exists. Now Crisco is a blend of soybean and palm oil; it no longer contains any cottonseed oil whatsoever, and is therefore nothing special anymore. There's no other way to get hydrogenated cottonseed oil that I know of either, short of buying it in bulk from distributors that supply food manufacturers and such.\n\nAs for \"healthy\" or \"unhealthy,\" I don't pay any attention to the propaganda, because there's no such thing as a substance which is inherently healthy or unhealthy. It all depends on the dosage and frequency of consumption. Even pure water is toxic if the dosage is too high, and the deadliest known \"poisons\" will do nothing to you if the dosage is low enough:\n\n>*Alle Dinge sind Gift, und nichts ist ohne Gift, allein die Dosis macht dass ein Ding kein Gift ist.*\n   \n>All things are poison, and nothing is without poison, the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison.\n\n>—Paracelsus",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Skip to second half. ^^Fake ^^toyo! ^^Sad!**\n\nWhat do you picture whenever you think of how soy sauce is made? If you’re like me, you imagined big clay pots containing a mishmash of soybeans, wheat, and salt. With time, refining, and a lot of help from fungi and bacteria, out comes a product that we all know and love, toyo or soy sauce. It’s a simple production method that’s been around for millenia. To my surprise, this isn’t how all soy sauces are made.\n \nBack then, soy sauce was made at home by cooking soybeans, adding wheat to it, putting it on bamboo trays, and letting it ferment for a few days. After it became moldy, it’s put  in a jar with brine then filtered through cloth. Tada! Soy sauce is born.\n \nToday, there are two main methods that we use to produce soy. The first one is **traditional fermentation** based on what the Japanese do. A special type of mold (*Aspergillus oryzae*), one that we also use for making *tausi*, is allowed to grow in cooked rice. The rice is then dried and ground. What results is something called *koji*. The *koji* is then added to cooked soybeans and roasted wheat flour. That concoction is then allowed to ferment on its own. It’s put in a brine solution and more microorganisms are added for additional fermentation and the development of flavor. They’re left to party for up to a year. The delicious mixture is then filtered, pasteurized, mixed with a preservative, then bottled. There are differences between the Chinese style and the Japanese style, but similar processes occur.\n \nThe second one is **chemical hydrolysis**. It sounds yummy, doesn’t it? It involves soybeans and wheat flour too, but that mixture is hydrolysed by boiling it in *hydrochloric acid*, neutralization with *sodium hydroxide*, and mixing it with brine. The whole process takes only a few days. The result doesn’t taste or smell like your regular soy sauce. To make it taste better, this method was modified by adding the microorganisms from the traditional method and allowing it to ferment for 3 months. Enhancers like MSG and caramel are added to make the product more appealing. It’s way faster (and usually cheaper) than fermentation. \n \nIt’s a contest between natural and chemical. Quality versus price. Nowadays, instead of using whole soybeans, the product left from making soybean oil is used. \n\n_____\n\n**Why am I telling you this?** Well, that’s because in the Philippines, the following types of soy sauce are available:\n\n* Fermented soy sauce\n* Hydrolysed soy sauce\n* Blend of both\n* Synthetic soy sauce made with the spent liquor from MSG manufacturing, brine, caramel, and flavoring\n \nThe standards we have for most of those types are practically the same. The types that you'll probably see in the markets are the blended/formulated ones. Soy sauces with caramel, flavor enhancers, dyes etc. They’re usually cheaper and therefore more popular. With regards to safety, they are generally recognized as safe, as far as I know anyway. But be sure to check any advisories by the FDA. \n\n[Here’s a partial list by DOH-FDA \\(2011\\) of safe soy sauce products](http://www.doh.gov.ph/sites/default/files/health_advisory/fda202011015.pdf) AND [make sure to avoid the products listed here.](http://www.fda.gov.ph/advisories-2/food-2/425170-fda-advisory-no-2017-096)\n\n**Which soy sauce do you use then? How are you supposed to know whether something comes from fermentation or hydrolysis?** \n \nAccording to our national product standards, manufacturers are required to specify in their labels whether or not their soy sauce comes from fermented soybeans, hydrolysed soybean protein (or plant protein), or if it’s a mixture of both. That has been a standard since 1993. Unfortunately, it still isn’t being strictly followed.\n \nWhat we can do is check the ingredients list to at least get some idea of how the product was made. What they exactly mean, I’m not 100% sure, but I did see these ingredients in the following brands:\n\nIngredient | Product\n---|---\nHydrolyzed soybean/soy protein | Datu Puti Soy Sauce, Knorr Liquid Seasoning\nHydrolyzed Protein Extracted from Wheat Flour | SM Bonus Chinese Soy Sauce\nBiologically Hydrolysed Wheat Protein | Maggi Savor\nSoybean extract | Golden Swan Soy Sauce, Lorins Soy Sauce, Marca Lapu Lapu, Mother’s Best Soy Sauce, Select Soy Sauce, Silver Swan Soy Sauce\nSoybeans/soya bean | Carp Premium Soy Sauce, Coconut Brand Premium Soy Sauce, Kikkoman, Lee Kum Kee Soy Sauce, Maggi Soy Sauce, Marca Piña Soy Sauce, SM Bonus Premium Soy Sauce, Sure Buy Seasoning, Uncle Tom Soy Sauce\n\nThere are very few soy sauces that indicated that they were brewed or fermented. Here are the few that I found:\n\nLabel | Product\n---|---\nNaturally brewed | Datu Puti Brewed Soy Sauce (the one in a fancy bottle), Golden Swan Soy Sauce, Kikkoman, Lee Kum Kee Soy Sauce\nNaturally fermented | Carp Premium Soy Sauce, Coconut Brand Premium Soy Sauce, Maggi Soy Sauce\nFermented soybeans | Uncle Tom Soy Sauce\nHydrolyzed and fermented | Tentay Soy Sauce\n\nIt’s not an exhaustive list, but I hope it helps a bit. Had trouble viewing those tables? [Here they are in picture form.](https://imgur.com/a/rFkWg)\n\nTo sum it up, if you want to buy naturally fermented soy sauce, check whether the label actually says it’s fermented or brewed. If it doesn’t specify, assume that it isn’t. If it does, you should still look at the ingredients because it doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't hydrolysed. Look at the labels for any keywords like hydrolyzed/hydrolysed, extract, naturally brewed, fermented etc. that will help you identify how that soy sauce was made. The simpler the ingredients list, the better.\n\nEDIT: Concerned about safety? I talk about it lightly in these comments ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/6h581d/the_toyo_you_use_may_not_be_what_you_think_it_is/diwuj4f/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/6h581d/the_toyo_you_use_may_not_be_what_you_think_it_is/divux9j/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/6h581d/the_toyo_you_use_may_not_be_what_you_think_it_is/divqsxu/)).\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

        "body": "all these people asking what toyo to buy... here are my inputs:\n\nIn my opinion, if you are very health conscious ~~you need to~~ and have a bigger budget, you'd probably want those that are supposedly ***processed *naturally*** (naturally brewed and naturally fermented) and have the **most *organic* sounding** (soybeans/soya beans) ingredients.\n\nIn the brands mentioned above, I have tried *Maggi and Kikkoman*. The difference between the two is that:\n\n* ***Maggi*** has a sweetness to it and the ingredients indicated in the bottle has a bit more \"chemical\" sounding ingredients (ex: MSG and Acetic acid) compared to the latter.\n\n* ***Kikkoman*** is a bit saltier than the former and the only \"chemical\" sounding ingredient indicated in the bottle is sodium benzoate. \n\nBetween the two, healthwise, I'd pick/recommend ***Kikkoman*** but for some dishes I like it when Maggi is used.\n\nBased on the list, the next choice I have tried and recommend is:\n\n* ***Marca Pina*** which is what we buy if we can't afford the first two choices. Based on the list above, it's difference with Silverswan is that Marca Pina uses soybeans/soya beans. I can't really say much because we don't have it in stock (because this is what we always use).\n\nThe next brands, I don't really have differentiation healthwise (before this post), it's more of preferences and more budget-friendly choices:\n\n* ***Silverswan*** has very similar ingredients with *Kikkoman* except that Silverswan uses soybean extract and has caramel. (I have compared the ingredients indicated on the bottle). Based on taste, Kikkoman has a more \"savory\" type of saltiness to it while Silverswan has a more \"fishy\" saltiness or, if I make sense, it's \"salty\" salty.\n\n* ***Datu Puti*** is the what we buy if there is no Silverswan sa tindahan haha but based on the list I guess this is not the most healthiest choice(?). We don't have it in stock now so I can't compare the taste or the other ingredients, but I do remember that I prefer Datu Puti for sawsawan and Silverswan for cooking.\n\n*disclaimer: my mother is the cook and she's health conscious. I'm ~~a picky eater~~ just very aware of food tastes and ~~subconsciously~~ inherited my mom's health consciousness ~~paranoia~~ haha\n\nTLDR: Here's the simplest and most practical ranking: ***Kikkoman, Marca Pina, Silverswan***",

I've been blindly making my fresh tuna chunk, covering them in oil and keeping them in the fridge; and then taking them out to make spaghetti al tonno, tonno e fagioli, niçoise salad, Andalusian tuna+potato salad, etc ...things like that.  The tuna is usually gone in a week.  Do I need to cover it in oil, then?  I imagine the oil submersion is like a confit, which is kept at cool temperature (but not fridge) and allowed to age.

Then, my give a Fs went on vacation and I just started cooking with it.

However, I really dislike the use of soybean oil in your food. I would love to enjoy your steak, but I stick with the carnitas due to the soybean oil.\n> \nSoybean oil is considered to be unhealthy by many, especially considering the high amounts of omega-6 fats that it contains.\n \n>I know that Chipotle has a huge following in the \"paleo\" community, which is a style of eating based on whole foods like grass-fed beef, and eliminating harmful processed foods and some grains (esp. those that contain gluten). However, it's well-known that only the pork at Chipotle is paleo-friendly. \n\n>Chipotle would generate a ton of good-will from health-conscious folks by elimanating the soy oil and putting steak back on the menu for people like me. \n\n>Best!\n \n>Mike\n\n\n**Their reply:**\n\nMichael,\n \nI'm happy to report that we are on the same page! We are actually working on replacing our soybean oil with non-GMO sunflower oil to fry our taco shells and chips in the following areas and locations:\n \nStores in Washington \n\nStores in Oregon \n\nStores in California \n\nStores in Nevada \n\nStores in Phoenix \n\nStores in Texas \n\nStores in Arkansas \n\nStores in Louisiana \n\nStores in Alabama \n\nStores in Georgia \n\nStores in Tennessee \n\nStores in North Carolina \n\nStores in South Carolina \n\nStores in Virginia \n\nStores in Washington DC \n\nStores in Virginia Beach \n\nStores in Maryland \n\nStores in Philadelphia \n\nStores in Delaware \n\nStores in Massachusetts \n\nStores in Connecticut \n\nStores in Rhode Island \n\nStores in New Hampshire\n\n \nAs of 12/19/11\nAll Florida restaurants, except for the Tallahassee locations\n \nAs of 9/25/11:\nStores in Denver \n\nStores in Utah \n\nStores in Colorado Springs \n\nStores in NYLI \n\nStores in NYC \n\nStores in New Jersey\n \nAs well as our Wilton, Henrietta, Lathamroute, CliftonPark and Univofroch locations.\n \nWe are also making the transition to non-GMO rice bran oil. As of August 24th 2012, the western half of the U.S. began using the rice bran oil in our pinto beans, black beans and adobo marinade. It is important to note that soybean oil is still used in our grills so while our chicken, steak and barbacoa is marinated in the adobo marinade containing rice-bran oil, they may still come into contact with the soy used on our grill. \n\nWe plan to completely replace our soybean oil with our sunflower and rice bran oils. I would recommend asking your local Chipotle to see where they are in this transition as this is an ongoing process. In the meantime, it may be helpful if you knew which offerings could still contain soybean oil before this transition is fully accomplished. The following items are made with soybean oil or contain it from the grill:\n \nChips\n\nCrispy corn taco shells\n\nRice\n\nFajita vegetables\n\nBlack beans\n\nPinto beans\n\nCarnitas\n\nChicken\n\nSteak\n\nBarbacoa\n\nChipotle honey vinaigrette\n\nLarge and Small Flour Tortillas\n \nThe following items are NOT made with soybean oil, although they could possibly come in contact with foods that are. I recommend you carefully consider your dining choices on this as well.\n \nMild tomato salsa\n\n Medium corn-poblano salsa\n\n Green chile tomatillo salsa\n\n Red chile tomatillo salsa\n\n Guacamole\n\n Cheese\n\n Sour cream\n\n Lettuce\n \nI hope this information proves helpful Michael.

I eat at Chipotle A LOT... Probably at least 3 - 4 times a week. I love the food, the freshness, and the ease of being able to carryout my Paleo Diet lifestyle with Chipotle. My only concern is the level of Omega-6 that I intake because of your use of Soy Oil. I was wondering if there has been any research into Chipotle switching to Coconut Oil instead? (I'd vouch for Animal Fat, but that would not help your vegetarian/vegan client base). Any insite into the matter would be great! Thanks so much! \n\nChipotle:\n> Thank you for contacting us to express your concern over our use of soy oil in our restaurants. This is not an aspect of our food's preparation that we are happy with, for a variety of reasons, including the one you mention. There have indeed been tests of alternative oils we could use in our recipes and grilling. Animal fat is not an option we've considered very strongly for the reason you mention. We have tested sunflower oil to very positive results and have high hopes of implementing it on a wider scale in the near future. \n\n> We realize that our food system isn't perfect, and neither are we, but we are invested in making our menu healthier and more sustainable. Thanks for your input and your support of our company. I hope you'll be pleased by the directions we take in the future.\n\nI also asked about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vzb8k/i_am_a_chipotle_mexican_grill_general_manager/c58yt00) in this deleted IAmA: [I am a Chipotle Mexican Grill General Manager with all the answers.

    "body": "So for a bit of background as to why I care - I have a soy protein intolerance. I cannot tolerate the soybean oil used in Kewpie - which is problematic for me, primarily because the use cases for Kewpie are more broad and diverse than western mayo. \n\nWhat I mean is, you aren't out of place throwing down a few thin stripes of kewpie over a rice or noodle bowl, whereas trying something like that with American mayo is an exercise in futility. Even if I were to take American mayo and stuff it into a kewpie bottle, it would sputter and spurt and not come out in perfect, thin ribbons the way Kewpie does.\n\nI've tried to make my own mayo, and leaned heavier into the egg yolks (and added MSG of course) in an attempt to mimic what Kewpie is doing, but even doing so, I don't wind up with a texture (or flavor for that matter) conducive to rice bowls and noodle bowls. \n\nThis process is driving me crazy, which is leading me to believe I'm missing some element of what they're doing. Some people have said they use dashi stock in theirs, but that doesn't track with the ingredients labels I've seen.\n\n\nThe other reason I believe there's something chemically different about Kewpie is due to the way it reacts in water - well, more specifically, *broth*. A popular ramen hack involved putting some kewpie in the bowl before adding the broth to turn the broth creamy. Kewpie does this without fail - but if you try it with American mayo it instead sort of \"shreds\" into these little white mayo particles that will not emulsify in no matter what you do.\n\nI thought maybe the broth was scrambling the mayo before it could separate, but even adding it in slowly, and stirring vigorously, it just wouldn't behave. By contrast, I have no such issues emulsifying an egg yolk into broth - so I don't think it's technique here. And Kewpie, of course, just *works* and doesn't scramble at all. What gives?\n\n\nDoes anyone know what's going on here?",

Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <What Is Going On?\n\nOn April 06, 2021, a “must pass” bill was introduced called the “Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act”(2)  (“Infrastructure Bill”). It passed in the House of Representatives and,  after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to  the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting  requirements and obligations for record keeping.\n\nWhile this bill  created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill  was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: “Digital  Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act” (3) (“Digital Asset Bill”).\n\nThis  bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy  Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It  changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international  crypto regulation into US law.\n\nThis article looks at each of these amendments…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Commodities or Securities?_\n\nThe  main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto  projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether,  and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All  other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:\n\n*“Not  later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section,  the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public  comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major  digital assets.*\n\n***Not later  than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***\\*, the SEC and  CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies\\* ***each of the top  25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii)  highest daily average trading volume as—*\n\n*(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.”* (4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Interpretation:\n\n* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.\n* Services  engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset  securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Commodities Regulation_\n\nThe  Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in  the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times  since then.(5)  It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading  activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded  on organized exchanges.\n\nIn 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain  exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over  commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within  the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as  commodities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Definition of “Commodity” Amended to Include Digital Asset:\n\nFirst and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:\n\n*“****The term “commodity” means***  *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums,  mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool,  wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut  oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal,  cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock  products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****,  and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles,  except onions (as provided by section 13–1 of this title) and motion  picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data  related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests  (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value  or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future  delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.”*(6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Digital Asset Definition\n\nNext, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Smart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures Contracts\n\nA  sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could  decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated  exchanges.\n\nCurrently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *“eligible contract participants”* or *“eligible commercial entities”*  to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on  leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a  person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar  basis.(8)\n\nNext,  additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset  Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the  delivery takes longer than 24 hours:\n\n*“(ii)  Exceptions*\n\n*(III) a contract of sale that–*\n\n*(cc)  with respect to* ***digital assets***\\*, results in\\* ***actual delivery*** *(including  transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the  transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by  either-*\n\n*(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or*\n\n*(BB)  with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed  ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC  registered digital asset trade repository; or”* (9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Dodd-Frank Act and Market Transparency\n\nAfter  the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict  regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital  assets as well.\n\nThe definition of swaps, as provided by the  Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could  refer to any “agreement, contract or transaction” that “provides for any  purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the  occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event  or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or  commercial consequence.” (10)\n\n## Next, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:\n\n* Regulate  swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require  dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\n* Increase  transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by  requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges  or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market  place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.\n* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Digital Asset Trade Repository\n\nTo  meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity  Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository  to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the  correct market information:\n\n*“The  term ‘digital asset trade repository’ means any person that collects and  maintains information or records with respect to transactions or  positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of  digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties  (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off  chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized  recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a  private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such  ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator  seeks to aggregate/include ‘off chain’ transactions as well.”* (12)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Interpretation Commodities Regulations:\n\n* As  of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed  as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).\n* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be  subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of  livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory  uncertainty for various business models in the industry.\n* No  “trading on margin” is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done  by high-level investors called “eligible contract parties.” This could  perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC  markets.\n* Smart contracts  that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures  contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can  be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the  CFTC.(13)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Securities Regulations_\n\nIn  the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act.  Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the  trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.\n\n## Definition of “Security” Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:\n\nFirst  and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be  amended to include a “digital asset security” (and exclude “digital  assets”) in the definition of security:\n\n*“(10)* ***The term “security” means***  *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,  bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or  lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or  subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***\\*,  voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any  put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate  of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest  therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,  option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange  relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly  known as a “security”; or any certificate of interest or participation  in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or  right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;\\* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***\\*,  or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker’s acceptance which has a  maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months,  exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which  is likewise limited.”\\* (14)\n\n## Digital Asset Security Definition\n\nNext, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:\n\n*“(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘digital asset security’ means a digital asset that:*\n\n*(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:*\n\n*(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.*\n\n*(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.*\n\n*(III)  Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include  new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the  digital asset) of the issuer.*\n\n*(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer’s liquidation.*\n\n*(ii)  In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not  wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with  respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***\\*)  which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset,  issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including  other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service,  goods, or platform of the issuer.”\\* (15)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## What does it mean to be regulated as a security?\n\nInvesting in securities in the US is regulated to:\n\n*“protect  interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to  protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal  Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets  in such transactions.”* (16)\n\nRegulations  focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and  subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).\n\nThe goal  of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all  material information that an investor would need in order to make up his  or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must  create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with  copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the  business, including audited financial statements.\n\nNext, the  subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by  restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has  oversight. The Security Exchange Act section §78l(a) states:\n\n*“It  shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any  transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a  national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to  such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of  this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.”* (17)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Summary of Securities Regulations:\n\n* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.\n* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.\n* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.\n* When  a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to  strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases  (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.\n* US  Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to  enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a  decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over  to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to  apply for “desecuritization.” (18)  The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a  network is decentralized? The investors? Weren’t they the ones supposed  to be protected in the first place?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Changing the Nature of Money_\n\nThese  regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider  discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only  changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is  created!\n\nAs a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US  Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary  instrument.(19)  However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to  specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as  legal tender.(20)  And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset  securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or  NCUA).(21)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Introducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)\n\nAfter  slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the  Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with  far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:\n\n*“(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****),  except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with  respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for  circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.”* (22)\n\nIn addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:\n\n*“Federal  reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to  Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter  set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any  other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition***  *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the  Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions***  *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be  obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender  and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal  reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department  of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia,  or at any Federal Reserve bank.”* (23)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Interpretations on the Future of Money:\n\n* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.\n* The  Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a  ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday  transactions in USD.\n* Digital  federal reserve notes will make the “recordation” of all transactions  possible. Did they use this word because “monitoring all transactions”  would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking  at them makes no sense.\n* These  amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve.  Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not “print money.”  It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24)  The private sector “creates” most of what we use as money by issuing  credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the  monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for  credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it  wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot  of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the  authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a  “digital USD” directly. It could change the entire structure of the  financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.\n* The  original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits  to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of  economic stress.(25)  But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be  based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how  much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be  distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be  handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment  has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This  deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside  the crypto-space as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US_\n\nThose  paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation  know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate  from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is  an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).\n\nIn March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26)  (“FATF Guidance”) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance  hasn’t been finalized, there are already a number of points directly  included in the Digital Asset Bill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Banning the use of Stablecoins\n\nSubchapter  I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code,  department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:\n\n*“(a) IN GENERAL.—Beginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).”*(27)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Criminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)\n\nThe  bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of  anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing  services.(28)  It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act  could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for  not more than five years, or both.(29)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Introduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US Law\n\nAs  a next step, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section  5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a  digital asset, or *“a digital representation of value that can be  digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or  investment purposes;”*(30)\n\nSo  far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their  relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of  Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States  Code:(31)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9h73a1z879o71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=28730b1ce17e8b920d65d9df418c1d9b7be5f0de\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVirtual  Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving  cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are  facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called “virtual  asset service providers,” or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill  defines a VASP:\n\n*“(A) means a person who—*\n\n*(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies*\n\n*(ii) exchanges between digital assets;*\n\n*(iii) transfers of digital assets;*\n\n*(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;*\n\n*(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and*\n\n*(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and*\n\n*(B) does not include any person who—*\n\n*(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;*\n\n*(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or*\n\n*(iii)  develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to  issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with  a digital asset.”* (32)\n\nThis  definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only  difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different  forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new  addition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## The Big Picture: Global Regulation\n\nThe logic  behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition  (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in  between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider  crypto-space can be applied at this level.\n\nFrom the latest FATF  Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be  deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of  “unhosted wallets,” the introduction of the “travel rule,” labeling  those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole  host of other measures. (33)\n\nOne  additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is  also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which  are available in the United States and to United States persons, have  to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located  outside the United States. (34)\n\n## Interpretation International Regulation in the US:\n\n* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.\n* The  FATF term “virtual asset service provider” (VASP) is introduced in the  US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto  projects.\n* After first being  in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced  cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of  their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.\n* It  is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently  discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted  wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce  to then never use.\n* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## <Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill_\n\nLast  August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a  section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:\n\n## Clarification of Definition of Broker\n\nIt  makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all  possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the  Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to  the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:\n\n*“(D)  any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly  providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf  of another person.”* (35)\n\n## Reporting of Digital Assets\n\nIn addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:\n\n*“any  digital representation of value which is recorded on a  cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology  as specified by the Secretary.”* (36)\n\n## Effective Date\n\nEffective after December 31, 2023. So there is time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Interpretation Infrastructure Bill\n\nThere  was a lot of commotion about this bill. This was mainly due to the wide  definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space,  including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg,  the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the  lines of the following:\n\n*“Other  firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market — from developers and  miners to hardware and software providers — won’t have any new  requirements, so long as they don’t also act as brokers, according to a  Treasury official”* (37)\n\nAt  a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally  feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on  miners due to the nature of the technology.\n\nIn this case perhaps  it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and  isn’t included. Moreover, comments from “anonymous sources at the  treasury” do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too  easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all,  including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change  over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are  needed.\n\nThe commotion also distracted from the massive changes  proposed in the Digital Asset Bill discussed in this post, which so  far have been ignored by the industry...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# <Sources_\n\nI added all 37 footnotes here, but the post become to long to post. For those who wish to check the footnotes, they can be found in the PDF version here:\n\n[https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Review-US-Digital-Asset-Regulation-September-2021.pdf](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Review-US-Digital-Asset-Regulation-September-2021.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# <TL;DR_\n\n**Next to the widely discussed infrastructure bill, another bill is pushed through US Congress: the “Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.” Both are not law yet and non of this is likely to take effect in 2021 (this cycle). And bills can be amended. But stricter regulations are coming for crypto in the US.**\n\n**Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such. Futures contracts are subjected to many existing regulations, including to the Dodd-Frank Act and in certain cases filing obligations with a CFTC digital asset trade repository.**\n\n**Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security. This remains to be determined by a joined ruling of the CFTC and SEC, which will likely be issued somewhere in 2022 (270 days after this bill is passed). Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.**\n\n**In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for likely further future regulation. Every US based VASP (or with US clients) has to be regulated (KYC) in the US. VASP regulation covers a large part of crypto projects.**\n\n**Finally, cryptos are specifically excluded as legal tender, and the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to create and distribute a distributed ledger based digital reserve note (CBDC), with \"recordation\" of all transactions.**",

I anticipate it's a losing battle unless we throw a significant amount of the money in the crypto space at protecting it from unfair legislation. The politicians deciding this stuff either have no idea what they're talking about or have ulterior motives in keeping finance centralized. Both are dangerous.\n\nThe world evolves too fast for us to continue having these idiots in their 60's and 70's that have 90% of their wealth in bonds making decisions for us. We need smart, young, educated, and eloquent people to find ways of communicating how traditional finance screws us and how this may be a chance to finally implement some much needed wealth redistribution in our corrupt country",

    "body": "Link to paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-00411-4\n\nTitle should read: “Ultra-processed ketogenic diets inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis and induce cardiac fibrosis in sedentary rats who consumed the diet for 10% of their lifespans”\n\nFirst of all, rodents did not evolve under conditions that required them to consume high fat ketogenic diets. For this reason, it seems obvious that long-term feeding of a species-inappropriate diet will cause health issues. \n\nHumans evolved eating organs, meat, and fat and fasting for extended periods during times of food scarcity. We likely would have been in a state of ketosis almost all the time. Given that our ancestors would have had high levels of activity, they also would have remained in ketosis even if tubers, berries, and/or honey were consumed (in today’s terms: professional cyclists on a ketogenic diet can consume 200g of carbs or more per day and still be in ketosis due to their high levels of activity). \n\nNext, let’s look at the ketogenic diet formulation used in this study:\n\n*the KD contained approximately 16.5% casein, 0.25% L-cystine, 8.2% cellulose, 4.25% soybean oil, 62.7% cocoa butter, 1.6% mineral mix, 2.1% dicalcium phosphate, 0.9% calcium carbonate, 2.7% potassium citrate, 0.16% vitamin mix, 0.32% choline bitartrate and 0.32% DL-methionine (percentages are mass%).*\n\nThese standardized rodent chows are acceptable (not ideal) for studying short term effects of keto diet, but it is simply erroneous to study animals on these chows in the long-term. This is essentially the equivalent of a human eating a heavily processed keto meal replacement (think keto-soylent) all day every day for 10% of their lifetime, or \\~8 years (this study fed rats for 4 months and lab rats live on average 3.5 years, which equates to \\~10% of their total lifespan). Not to mention these rats are totally sedentary. When humans eat a ketogenic diet, we aren’t eating some fat and protein isolate fortified with synthetic forms of essential nutrients. Our foods are complex matrices of vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and more in specific ratios that provide our bodies with the information needed for their proper assimilation and integration. \n\nI also cannot understand how their rats had 3HB concentrations of 4.5mM while eating their ketogenic chow. I worked with mice on ketogenic diet and their serum levels would reach \\~2mM max. In humans on keto diet, 1mM is average. Concentrations between 3-5mM are consistent with long-term fasting/starvation.. For example, in George Cahill’s starvation studies in the 60s, circulating 3HB levels didn’t reach to 4mM until after 10 days of starvation in obese individuals. \n\nIf the authors really wanted to know if ketogenic diets truly pose a long-term risk in humans, they should have focused their research on individuals with intractable epilepsy many of whom have been on ketogenic diets for some version of their whole lives. Do these individuals have increased rates of cardiac fibrosis relative to epileptics who are not on ketogenic diets? I have never seen clinical data suggesting this, but this is where I would look if I were doing the study. \n\nRegarding their clinical data references, they do not appear to have adjusted their data for incidence of insulin resistance/pre-diabetes/diabetes, nor did they even report the demographics of the patients in the study. “Diabesity” is a huge risk factor for atrial fibrillation, and pre-diabetes/diabetes causes increases in circulating ketone body levels in a totally different context than ketogenic diet. In ketogenic diet, the body is burning fat and ketones because there is very little carbohydrate available (normal physiologic situation), in diabetes the body is burning fat and ketones because it cannot properly burn carbohydrates (pathologic situation with broad consequences across the tissues of the body). This is all to say that it is misleading to present this data without sharing additional clinical data on the patients, and it is highly likely that most of the patients in the study were metabolically unhealthy, which is a MAJOR confounding factor when analyzing these data.  \n\nFinally, I feel that it is extremely disingenuous of the authors to claim that a long-term ketogenic diet is harmful, when the alternative diet for the average person is the Standard American diet. Perhaps they should’ve put their control rats on a standard American chow, then we will see the truth. \n\nTLDR: The experimental conditions used in this paper do not accurately represent the context in which humans would consume ketogenic diets. To say ketogenic diet is harmful without comparing it to the alternative (standard American diet) is disingenuous. Patient data likely confounded by metabolic dysfunction.",

This study analyzed avocado oils currently on the market in the US to evaluate their quality (e.g., free fatty acidity, peroxide value, UV absorbances, vitamin E) and purity (e.g., fatty acids, sterols, triacylglycerols). Our results showed that the majority of commercial samples were oxidized before reaching the expiration date listed on the bottle. In addition, adulteration with soybean oil at levels near 100% was confirmed in two “extra virgin” and one “refined” sample. These findings demonstrate there is an urgent need to develop standards for avocado oil not only to ensure the consumers receive high quality and authentic products but to establish a level playing field to support the continuing growth of global avocado oil industry.\"\n\nEdit: Here's an article about this study also.\n\n[https://www.ucdavis.edu/food/study-finds-82-percent-avocado-oil-rancid-or-mixed-other-oils/](https://www.ucdavis.edu/food/study-finds-82-percent-avocado-oil-rancid-or-mixed-other-oils/)",

Recently, increased consumption of soybean oil, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been proposed to play a causal role in the epidemic. Here, we designed a series of four isocaloric diets (HFD, SO-HFD, F-HFD, F-SO-HFD) to investigate the effects of saturated versus unsaturated fat, as well as fructose, on obesity and diabetes. C57/BL6 male mice fed a diet moderately high in fat from coconut oil and soybean oil (SO-HFD, 40% kcal total fat) showed statistically significant increases in weight gain, adiposity, diabetes, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared to mice on a diet consisting primarily of coconut oil (HFD). They also had fatty livers with hepatocyte ballooning and very large lipid droplets as well as shorter colonic crypt length. While the high fructose diet (F-HFD) did not cause as much obesity or diabetes as SO-HFD, it did cause rectal prolapse and a very fatty liver, but no balloon injury. The coconut oil diet (with or without fructose) increased spleen weight while fructose in the presence of soybean oil increased kidney weight. Metabolomics analysis of the liver showed an increased accumulation of PUFAs and their metabolites as well as γ-tocopherol, but a decrease in cholesterol in SO-HFD. Liver transcriptomics analysis revealed a global dysregulation of cytochrome P450 (Cyp) genes in SO-HFD versus HFD livers, most notably in the Cyp3a and Cyp2c families. Other genes involved in obesity (e.g., Cidec, Cd36), diabetes (Igfbp1), inflammation (Cd63), mitochondrial function (Pdk4) and cancer (H19) were also upregulated by the soybean oil diet. Taken together, our results indicate that in mice a diet high in soybean oil is more detrimental to metabolic health than a diet high in fructose or coconut oil.\n>",

She has been supportive of my change in lifestyle and also wants to lose weight.  Keyword: **wants**\n\n> be LMP_GF's father (OLDHAM), type 2 BEETUS, daily shot, golf w/cart once a week is exercise right?\n\n> OLDHAM's birthday party, cooking on the grill, ME brings my own steak and veggies.\n\nI brought my own food. I pack or cook my own meals almost exclusively. If I tell more stories, you'll all understand why.  But, for the time being, just accept it.\n\n> OLDHAM and others have side of brontosaur (each person had at least 12oz-16oz of steak), chicken breasts (candied with BBQ sauce then covered again after cooking), baked potatoes (cup of sour cream, pile of shredded cheese, butter), salad (well, dressing with some leaves floating around in them)\n\n> They be PROUD! EATIN HEALTHY\n\n> ME, takes some salad\n\n> They be AMAZED, I eat it dry (well with my cut up steak on the top).\n\nTheir dressings were all soybean oil based creamy things. I try and avoid soybean oil and all traces of dairy (lactose issues, trying a pure elimination diet for a month to see if stomach issues resolve--seems to be working).\n\n> EAT ALL THE THINGS.  Enough food for 10 people, consumed by LMP_GF and her two parents.\n\n> COMA time, 45 minute rest to let physical pain in stomachs rest.\n\n> OLDHAM, complains about how his Dr. is worried about his blood sugar...  must be genetic because he eats so healthy and it doesn't get any better\n\n> ATE SO GUD, DESERVE CAKE!\n\n> Carvel Ice Cream Cake -- 15 servings, 210 calories a serving, cut it into fourths!\n\n> \"EAT CAKE, it's only 210 calories, YOU BEEN GUD. YOU CAN CHEAT A LITTLE!\"\n\n> ME, \"No thanks, dairy.\"\n\n> THEM, \"FINE, more for us.\"\n\n> WATCH them CONSUME entire cake!\n\n> Be later that night, talking about my recent weight loss (was slacking for a while but got back on track and dropped ~4kg in the past 2 weeks).\n\n> LMP_GF: \"This is why women hate men. It's SO easy for you to lose weight. I eat healthy and I haven't lost a pound!\"\n\n> Uhm, yeah, I am not touching that with a 20ft pole. But where has she been when I have been running 30-50 minutes a few times a week, biking for an hour or more, eating every day without cheating?\n\nHonestly, she does this all the time.  Won't eat vegetables that aren't covered in mayo-based dressings, butter, or cheese. Who am I kidding? Won't eat most vegetables even if those conditions are met.  Most of her food is breaded and fried (or steak). Potatoes with every meal, typically fried. Rice if she's being healthy (with cheese and flecks of green broccoli).\n\nAnyway, I was so grossed out that they ate the entire cake.  That's 1,000 calories per person... for dessert! I am mostly grossed out because, there was a time when I would have taken my quarter of that cake and eaten it without second thought.\n\nThere's so many stories of stuff like this.

I could gain 10 lbs, but then work it out and lose it in less than 5 days...or even 1 day, depending on if I was training for a marathon or not.\n\nI didn't hear about the negativity of seed oils till about 2 years ago, after I suddenly started struggling with my health.  I gained weight mostly, started losing the hair on my head, started having a lot of joint pain, and had skin infections that I just could not get rid of!  It was driving me crazy!!!  I thought, maybe I was just getting old (or in my case, older).\n\nSo after doing much research, I cut out seed oils completely.  For the first few months, it felt great eating Fried Chicken fried in beef tallow, but still, I had health issues, so I was a bit skeptical about the seed oil negativity.\n\nThen, about 4 months after cutting seed oils, I started having these what I call \"emotional dumps\", where I'd go to the bathroom, just excrete out a really tiny amount of waste, and then feel incredibly emotional for the whole day, like I had just given birth or something (fyi, I'm a dude!). The first time I had an emotional dump, I literally crawled into bed afterwards and slept the whole day.  I felt I had lost a friend!\n\nAnd then I noticed my pot belly went down a little! And the more emotional dumps I had, the more it went down, and also, the less emotional the dumps were.\n\nNow, a little over a year after I cut out the seed oils, I am back to being fit again, lost my pot belly, and just have a general sense of well being.  The hair has literally grew back on the bald spots on my head about a month ago, my skin infections have cleared, and I have absolutely no joint pain!  And the crazy thing is, I still have fried chicken fried in beef tallow every so once in a while, like maybe once every 2 months (as my cravings have been eliminated), and there is no detriment to my body.  I feel great!\n\nI'm convinced my emotional dumps were the seed oils being excreted from my body after lingering in it as visceral fat.  That said, I'm also convinced I haven't gotten rid of all the seed oils in my body, so I just continue avoiding them permanently and expect to excrete them out entirely another year or so.  But this month has been a milestone for me, as I no longer feel fat, old. sick, creaky, or even balding!!!\n\nWord to the wise - Get rid of seed oils, never eat fast food, learn how to cook your own food, and when you realize you do not have to give up on your favorite fried foods (just fry them in beef tallow), you will get your health back!!!!",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "So a new 6 month study with 217 healthy individuals came out a few days ago. They put the people into 3 groups which were high fat diet, moderate fat, and low fat. They all ate the same amount of calories just the fats and carbs were different. Study posted below.\n\n[https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2019/01/18/gutjnl-2018-317609](https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2019/01/18/gutjnl-2018-317609)\n\nAfter 6 months what they found was that the high fat diet group had unfavourable changes on the gut microbiota and inflammatory factors. They also mentioned this could lead to negative long term health issues.\n\nBUT you need to read the fine print. First of all the high fat diet was only 40% fat. Now call me crazy but a diet that is 40% fat I wouldn't call a high fat diet.\n\nThey used Soybean Oil as the main fat source for the high fat group. Up to 24% of their total calories came from soybean oil. High amounts of soybean oil is pro inflammatory. They even admitted to this but it's buried all the way at the bottom. Here is a quote\n\n\"It should be noted that the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was relatively high in the higher-fat diet group (24% of total energy) owing to exclusive use of soybean oil, which is rich in n-6 PUFA. A higher intake of n-6 PUFA has been reported to have proinflammatory effects.\"\n\nOutlets are already running with this such as Webmd who posted this- [https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20190220/high-fat-diets-do-no-favors-for-your-gut-bacteria#1](https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20190220/high-fat-diets-do-no-favors-for-your-gut-bacteria#1)\n\nI have no foot in this race.

        "body": "> First of all the high fat diet was only 40% fat. Now call me crazy but a diet that is 40% fat I wouldn't call a high fat diet.\n\nThis is pretty typical terminology in the research past and present, ~40%+ is often categorized as \"high fat,\" this is definitely not unique to this particular study.  They're not claiming it's a keto diet.  I'm not sure an \"appeal to what sounds right to me\" is a compelling argument, it'd probably be more helpful to attempt to look at other similar research.\n\nAs to their use of soybean oil, while a shitload of soybean oil is certainly not optimal, the researchers did explain their rationale, and it kind of seems like you're missing the actual (Chinese) context of this research.\n\n> We achieved the required macronutrient distribution in the three diet groups by replacing a proportion of energy derived from carbohydrate (mainly white rice and wheat flour, the most consumed carbohydrate sources in Asia) with fats (**mainly soybean oil, the most widely used edible oil in Asia**).\n\nThis is a Chinese study that took place in China and was looking at changing dietary patterns in the population and how an increase in fat may be altering the gut microbiome.  The use of soybean oil appears to be due to the fact that this actually reflects what Chinese people are eating.  They explain their rationale quite clearly here:\n\n> There has been interest in the role of gut microbiota in the development of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.7 Rodent studies have suggested that the high-fat Western-type diet has a strong effect on the genetic composition and metabolic activity of gut microbiota.8 9 Evidence has shown that in humans gut microbiota diversity and richness are reduced when comparing such high-fat diets with more traditional diets with relatively higher proportions of carbohydrate.10 11 Such diet-induced ‘dysbiosis’ in gut-associated microbial communities has been postulated as a major trigger of metabolic impairments associated with obesity.12 Much of the relevant existing literature on humans is based on observational studies and the relatively few short-term dietary intervention trials suggest that the effect of dietary change might be relatively modest.13–16 No information is available relating to healthy young people or to populations whose diet is in transition from that traditionally consumed to one associated with a high risk of cardiometabolic disease.\n\n> Thus in a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial among healthy young adults, we compared a number of attributes of gut microbiota and faecal metabolomic profiles as well as markers of inflammation for diets of differing proportions of fat and carbohydrate.\n\nNote that they're also pointing to a previous base of evidence which supports this position, and qualifying that they wanted a direct (human) RCT to look at this rather than relying on epidemiology or animal research.  At no point do they say they're attempting to test \"healthy\" high fat diets, just the type of diets people are actually shifting towards in the Chinese population.\n\nSo, they performed an RCT and measured gut microbiome changes based on how actual Chinese peoples' diets have been changing from their historical, lower fat diet.  Note that they actually managed to match protein and fiber between groups, which puts this miles ahead of most research of this sort as those are enormous confounders.  It also includes a very in-depth analysis on the effect of the diet on the different gut flora.\n\nConsider again what food they replaced with soybean oil - white rice and wheat flour, both of which fall more or less in the \"refined carbohydrate\" bucket that I'm pretty sure you could probably make similar comments on wrt being pro-inflammatory.  How do I know they're refined carbohydrate?  Because all the participants averaged ~14 grams of fiber per day, which by definition means the preponderance of their carbohydrate intake was refined.\n\nAnd in that context, replacing refined carbohydrate with soybean oil led to deleterious changes in the gut microbiome.  That's really all this study said, and they tested these particular diets because it seems to reflect the broader changes in Chinese dietary patterns which are already happening.\n\nI'm not seeing at all how the researchers hid this, and trying to shove it into some sort of agenda war of \"low fat\" vs. \"low carb\" seems completely unwarranted.  The researchers weren't trying to construct a \"healthy\" high fat diet, they were attempting to tease out how changes in Chinese dietary patterns may be influencing the gut microbiome, and how that in turn may be part of the bigger picture for the increase in diseases of western civilization (CVD, cancer, diabetes etc.) that have traveled alongside these changes.",

If you missed it, the previous installations of the series can be found here: \n\n1.\t[ROSACEA, REDNESS, and IRRITATION]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4v2uii/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)\n\n2.\t[OILY SKIN and ACNE]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4vidxl/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)\n\n\nProducts, tips, or advice that come up frequently will be listed in **bold.** I have grouped everything that's toner -> ampoule since the lines can get kind of blurry in those categories, and oil-based and foaming cleansers are also grouped. I have included Western products in order to be inclusive of the advice found on this subreddit. I have tried to place those items lower on the list in each category to give prominence to Asian items, given the nature of this sub.\n\n\nPlease feel free to add to the comments - if you see your HG for dry skin isn't listed, tell me! I would love for this to be a working document that is edited as needed, so we can also consider converting into a similar format as it exists over on r/SkinCareAddiction\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: What follows is a compilation of the advice given on this subreddit to address conditions associated with dry, over-exfoiated skin, and other symptoms associated with a damaged or impaired moisture barrier. It is not a substitute for medical advice or the advice of a dermatologist, nor are they indicative of my own preferences or what I would personally advise. Before trying any new product, it behooves you to check ingredient lists, take note of personal or individual sensitivities, patch test, and introduce only one new product at a time\n\nIF YOUR SKIN IS BROKEN, CRACKED, FISSURED, BLEEDING, OR ASSOCIATED WITH SWELLING, EXQUISITE TENDERNESS, FEVER, PUSTULES, OR PUS, PLEASE LEAVE THE INTERNET AND SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM A HUMAN BEING. IN PERSON.\n\n**For those of you experiencing dryness and sensitivity as a result of prescrpiption topicals,** its important to communicate your skins response with your healthcare provider. You may need to be scaling back your dosage, frequency, or both, or may need to consider alternate treatments. Please do not rely on Dr. Internet for addressing issues with a prescription. \n\n**Another Note:** You’ll notice some overlap between this and previous lists in this series, especially the rosacea/redness post. Lines do get blurry, but I tried to focus my sources/threads as much as possible. These lists are compiled with the newbie/beginner in mind, and due to their “crowd-sourced” nature, will lean towards inclusion of more popular, “mainstream” products. As always, these compilations are starting points for discussion, and the most fun part for me is including feedback as it rolls in, so **please, share what has worked for you.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Cleansers, Cream Cleansers*\n\n* Banila Co Clean It Zero in Purity\n\n* Botanic Farm Grain Ferment Cleansing Sherbet \n\n* Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm\n\n* Skin Food Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil \n\n* Illi Total Aging Care Oil Cleanser\n\n* DHC Cleansing Oil\n\n* XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cleansing Oil \n\n* History of Whoo Gongjinhyang Cream Cleanser\n\n* L'Oreal RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser\n\n* Mandom Bifesta Cleansing Lotion\n\n* Missha Super Aqua Fresh Cleansing Milk\n\n* Andalou Naturals Probiotic Cleansing Milk\n\n* Skinfood Green Tea Cleansing Milk\n\n* **Hada Labo Tokyo Hydrating Facial Cleanser**\n\n* **Cerave Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n* Papa Recipe White Flower Enzyme Powder Cleanser\n\n* **COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-trouble Cleansing Gel\n\n* Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash – some have found this too harsh, for others, its the only thing their skin tolerates.

Think sleeping packs and thick creams.  Petrolatum (Vaseline) is the gold standard, but a good rule of thumb is to go as heavy and occlusive as your skin can handle without clogging pores. \n\n* Many facial oils are not occlusives. Read more about oils and occlusion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/)\n\n* What occlusive you eventually choose is largely individualized. Some rely on petrolatum-based balms, for others this results in bad breakouts. As always, patch test and add only one new product at a time. \n\n* What works for your skin can rapidly shift depending on climate, season, and region. Pay attention to signs of how your skin is responding to these various factors so you can adjust your routine accordingly. Be ready to change things up\n\n* You might be here because you’ve over exfoliated. You can generally tell this because 1) you just upped your acids, and 2) your skin is newly very sensitive to even mild products. You can read more here on [how to tell if you’ve damaged your moisture barrier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/33xhax/what_are_the_signs_to_look_out_for_for/) Learn your lesson and when you restart, GO SLOWLY. Many people with lots of acids in their routine got there after sloooowly ramping up and allowing their skin to adjust. And consider [joining a support group ;)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tac9m/can_we_have_a_support_group_for_overexfoliators/)\n\n* If your dry skin is new and likely the result of new or increased actives in your routine (especially rein-A and other retinols, BHA, andor AHA) BACK OFF THE ACTIVES until your moisture barrier heals. DO NOT TRY TO “POWER THROUGH.” Scale back on your routine to the bare essentials, focusing on mild products, hydration, and occlusive creams. \n\n* Consider your cleanser. Tightness, dryness, and sensitivity that seems to be resistant to all the layers of hydration and creams may be the result of a cleanser your skin hates. Many with dry skin recommended avoiding foaming cleansers and using a cleansing milk as their second cleanser. Also consider cutting back to once-a-day cleansing, or simply rinsing your face with water. \n\n* Another recommendation was to save washing the face for evening\n\n* Consider eliminating anything that foams. \n\n* Please consider seeing a dermatologist if you can. Topical steroids may be something to consider if your skin is really suffering. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSources:\n\n[Help with Dry Skin and Double Cleansing]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4ca5e2/help_with_dry_skin_and_double_cleansing/)\n\n[Looking for a Gentle, low pH Second Cleanser for Dry Skin!]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4alfwn/looking_for_a_gentle_low_ph_second_cleanser_for/)\n\n[Cure for dry skin for retin a user- Vaseline]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/42zbt5/cure_for_dry_skin_for_retin_a_user_vaseline/)\n\n[Best toner and essence for normal-dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/44bnvp/best_toner_and_essence_for_normaldry_skin/)\n\n\n[Looking for a moisturizing mist for winter and dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/47ksng/looking_for_a_moisturizing_mist_for_winter_and/)\n\n[Dry skin product recommendations]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3e9yik/dry_skin_product_recommendations/)\n\n[What cushions do you recommend for my dry skin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/45lue2/what_cushions_do_you_recommend_for_my_dry_skin/)\n\n[Sheet mask recommendation dry skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/38ekvx/sheet_mask_recommendation_dry_skin/)\n\n[Warning: Unpleasant Acne Pictures.

        "body": "Not AB, but Earth Science has a cream cleanser that I believe is fatty alcohol free and is around pH 5.5. I also plan to try out some non-foaming cleansing gels in order to check out what alternatives are out there for those with drier skin. First on my list is a kose cleansing gel, which I saw was described as weakly acidic. \n  \nAlso, I have dehydrated-prone and acne-prone skin that leans dry. Right now I'm using shea butter as a final step since no other facial oil has worked out for me, and it's going pretty well so far! I have the NOW Foods Shea butter tub. It can be a bit hard to spread, so I stuck a chopstick in and \"whipped\" it for a looser texture. However, it still tugs a bit when being applied to the skin. I found the best way to apply it is to take some of the whipped shea butter in my hand, warm it up and then apply it - either by spreading, or pressing my palms to my face.  \n  \nI've tried all sorts of sleeping packs and oils, but I'm finally waking up with skin that isn't dry or dehydrated. Vaseline also works decently, but shea butter seems to be the right mix of occlusive and emollient for my skin. Over the course of the night, some of it absorbs and I wake up with pretty good skin (much better than before, I can definitely say). I still might go back to playing around with vaseline during the winter months. We'll see how it goes.   \n  \nAnyway, the point of this tangent is that I recommend adding shea butter to the facial oil list haha. I know there's actually a shea oil, but I've never tried it and I believe the components of shea butter that are beneficial for dry skin are removed in the process of making shea oil. So it should be a bit lighter, if anyone is interested in a lighter take on shea butter.   \n  \nLastly, [this post about occlusives](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) might be of interest to those with dry skin.   \n  \nETA: Wanted to clarify that I use lots of hydrating layers, but they mean nothing without a good occlusive.   \n  \nEdit: words",

        "body": "Not sure if my skin passes for dry because I usually try to deal with the dryness as soon as it appears and keep it as normal as possible. \n\nThings I use and I have found that work for me: \n\n* Tony Moly Aquaporin Moisture Foam Cleanser - this is a really basic cleanser, it's not even low pH, but I find it very gentle. \n* Vivant Skincare Green Tea Antioxydant Cleanser - this one is the gentlest cleanser I've used, it's low pH but it's so pricey. I will probably replace with Sulwhasoo Snowise next. It's the only cleanser I've used that leaves my skin like I haven't washed it but clean (if you know what I mean... xD). \n\nMy favorite creams for my driest moments during winter are: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Essential Firming Cream - I order sample jars of this on eBay and it comes out very affordable. This is my favorite moisturizer for normal/dry skin. It simply leaves my skin super hydrated and glowing, even if I step all the other steps in my routine. \n* Mizon S-venom Wrinkle Tox Cream - this cream is amazing as an occlusive, I absolutely fell in love with it! It left my skin so amazingly soft and hydrated. \n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal 24h Comfort Nourishing Cream - this is a recent fave, for the price of 12€ for two tubs of this, it's perfect. I really like this line by YR for normal/dry skin, for those of you interested in trying non AB EU skincare, I'd highly recommend them, they are super affordable as well. \n\nMy favorite sleeping pack is: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask - this mask is magic for dry skin and soon as I start using this after getting dry patches they disappear. And it also helps for brighter skin tone. \n\nFavorite facial oil: \n\n* Pure cold-pressed avocado oil - I used this before I started using the Sulwhasoo sleeping mask. A 250 ml costs around 4€ in the supermarket, so I'd highly recommend it to everyone with dry skin. \n\nToner I am using for a while: \n\n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal Velvety Toner - this is a really great locally available toner for me and for the price of 8€ for two bottles, I'd call this a pretty amazing deal. \n\nI am really interested in adding new stuff to my stash. I'd like to get a new toner and at the moment I am really hesitating between the Kikumasamune and the Hadalabo Hyaluronic Acid one, I would love if someone could tell me how they performed for them. \n\nI'd also like to buy serums/essences because I am only using actives at the moment. I am interested in Mizon Hyaluronic Acid Amoule, Cosrx Snail Essence, Cosrx Galactomyces Essence, Scinic Snail AIO, Scinic Propolis Ampoule, basically the choice is hard here. \n\nI've used couple of different gel creams but I don't find they are that amazing for dry skin, just a good thing to layer as a moisturizer. Ones I've used are \n\n* Mizon Watervolume Aqua Gel Cream \n* Mizon Aloe 90 Soothing Gel\n* Mizon Snail Recovery Gel \n* 3W Clinic Snail Mucus Soothing Gel \n\nFavorite sunscreens: \n\n* Bioré UV Perfect Milk - this is really great for dry skin, I imagine it will be my go to sunscreen during winter. \n* Missha All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun \n\n\nOther random things that worked out for me: \n\n* Layering several layers of moisturizers instead of using one heavy layer of a moisturizing cream. I don't know why exactly that works the way it works, it might have to do something with the skin absorbing the ingredients more easily that way. \n* Careful with actives! It took me 3 months to build a tolerance to be able to use vitamin C daily (and once per day only) so I learned it the hard way, my skin doesn't like too much actives. I only use AHA once/twice per week and my skin looks really great right now. \n\n\nSorry for the non AB suggestions!",

Canola, olive, and soybean oils showed the strongest protective effects, with canola oil leading in risk reduction. The study is observational, meaning it shows associations but does not prove causation. Findings align with prior research, but self-reported dietary data and potential confounding factors limit conclusions.\n\n**Source:** [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265)\n\n# Study Findings\n\nA study followed **over 220,000 people for more than 30 years**, tracking their dietary fat intake and overall mortality risk. Higher butter intake was linked to a higher risk of death, while those who consumed more plant-based oils had lower mortality rates.\n\nIndividuals who consumed about a tablespoon of butter daily had a 15% higher risk of death compared to those with minimal butter intake. Consuming approximately two tablespoons of plant-based oils such as olive, canola, or soybean oil was associated with a 16% lower risk of mortality. Canola oil had the strongest association with reduced risk, followed by olive oil and soybean oil.\n\nThe study was observational, meaning it tracked long-term eating habits without assigning specific diets to participants. While it does not establish causation, the results are consistent with prior research indicating that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats improves cardiovascular health and longevity.\n\nOlive, canola, and soybean oils were associated with lower mortality, whereas corn and safflower oil did not show a statistically significant benefit. Researchers suggest that omega-3 content and cooking methods may contribute to these differences.\n\nAdjustments were made for dietary quality, including refined carbohydrates, but butter intake remained associated with increased mortality. Butter used in baking or frying showed a weaker association with increased risk, possibly due to lower intake frequency.\n\nReplacing 10 grams of butter per day with plant oils was associated with a 17% reduction in overall mortality and a similar reduction in cancer-related deaths.\n\n# Strengths of the Study\n\n* **Large Sample Size & Long Follow-Up:** **Over 220,000 participants were tracked for more than 30 years**, allowing for robust statistical analysis and long-term health outcome tracking.\n* **Multiple Cohorts & Population Representation:** Data from three major studies—the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study—improves generalizability.\n* **Validated Dietary Assessment:** Food intake was measured every four years using validated food frequency questionnaires, increasing reliability.\n* **Comprehensive Confounder Adjustments:** The study controlled for variables including age, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, cholesterol, hypertension, and family history.\n* **Dose-Response Analysis:** Different levels of butter and plant oil consumption were examined to identify gradual trends.\n* **Substitution Analysis:** The study modeled the effects of replacing butter with plant-based oils, making the findings more applicable to real-world dietary changes.\n* **Consistency with Prior Research:** Findings align with other studies showing benefits of replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats.\n\n# Weaknesses of the Study\n\n* **Observational Design:** The study identifies associations but cannot confirm causation.\n* **Self-Reported Dietary Data:** Participants may misreport food intake, introducing recall bias.\n* **Limited Dietary Context:** The study does not fully account for overall diet quality or other lifestyle factors.\n* **Cohort Bias:** Participants were primarily health professionals, limiting applicability to broader populations.\n* **No Differentiation Between Butter Sources:** All butter was treated the same, without distinction between grass-fed and conventional varieties.\n* **Cooking Methods Not Considered:** The study does not account for how plant oils were used in cooking, which may influence health outcomes.\n* **Potential Institutional Bias:** Conducted by researchers at Harvard, which has historically promoted plant-based diets.\n* **Healthy User Bias:** People consuming more plant-based oils may also engage in other health-promoting behaviors.\n* **Contradictory Research on Saturated Fats:** Some meta-analyses suggest that butter may have a neutral effect when part of a whole-food diet.",

(Occlusives are ingredients that lock in moisture, serving as a physical barrier between your skin and the outside world.)\n\nThe thing is, most plant oils aren't actually great occlusives! They're still often phenomenal ingredients at moisturizing, healing, and soothing, but they won't serve as occlusive agents. That means you can use them earlier in your routine, before creams (or even before sheet masks, to really push that oily goodness deep in your skin!). It also means if you want an occlusive layer, you should look for something with one or more of the following ingredients.\n\n**List of occlusive agents:**\n\n* Petrolatum (the most occlusive - 99% reduction in trans-epidermal water loss)\n\n* Fatty alcohols like cetyl and stearyl alcohol\n\n* Hydrocarbon oils like mineral oil, silicones (esp. dimethicone and cyclomethicone), and squalene\n\n* Wax esters like beeswax and lanolin\n\n* Vegetable waxes like candelilla, carnauba, and palm kernel\n\n* A few key oils, usually ones that are high in oleic acid and have a thicker, greasier feel: olive, rice bran, macadamia, castor, and soybean oil, plus shea butter\n\n* Cholesterol\n\n* Lecithin\n\nHappy occlusing!\n\n**EDIT**: based on [this chart](http://www.floratech.com/Uploads/pdfs/occlusivitychart.pdf) shared by /u/vanityrex, I've made some edits to the above list.\n\n**EDIT 2**: based on [this paper](http://www.probotanic.com/pdf_istrazivanja/ulje_jojobe/Primena%20biljnih%20ulja%20u%20kozmetici.pdf) linked from /u/surrealist_comb, I took jojoba oil off the list.",

        "body": "Being 1st born generation born Portuguese in the States, sardines is a huge staple in the Portuguese diet... unfortunately, considering I grew up with options in America, and not as poor as my parents were when they lived in Portugal, I never got into them. I think it's the bones, mostly, because I do recall at least enjoying the ones my grandfather would grill. I remember one time I hurt my mouth and throat and was all set... so much work to pick them out, too. They're considerably bigger than the tin can ones, however. I do wish I enjoyed them, though. \\*shrug\\*\n\nCheap, healthy and underrated as a great protein source is tuna. When I competed in physique competitions, my diet generally consisted of tuna and broccoli, because it was cheap and easy. I either prepped a bunch of broccoli for the week and brought cans of tuna with me, or just divided a frozen bag among Pyrex containers. 1 can, probably a third, or half of a bag of frozen broccoli and you got yourself a meal. Want a carb? Potatoes (eat the skin), sweet potatoes, brown rice (again, cheap), oatmeal (cheap)... And honestly, the only fruit I ever bought most of the time was Gala apples (it's all my teeth could tolerate). Occasionally I would \"treat\" myself to the \"more expensive\" strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and/or blueberries.\n\nProtein powder, though initially can be pricey, in the long run is pretty cheap and a great source for when you need to boost your protein, or when you don't feel like eating, or don't have the time... it's been my staple for lunch lately. 2 scoops, water and an apple.\n\nI know everyone eye rolls protein, but if you're experiencing issues with hair loss, weak nails, muscle loss, connective tissue issues, it's likely you're not getting enough protein. Amino acids are literally the building blocks of life and too many turn their noses up at it. Not sure why.\n\nIf you can tolerate it: low fat cottage cheese and greek yogurt. Have a salad with the cottage cheese, or throw in some fruit with your yogurt.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention eggs. Eggs can be cheap... can be, being the key words. I used to have my dad buy them at Costco for me (I don't have a membership). My sister and friend now have chickens, and I don't eat eggs as much as I used to (got lazy and depressed - working on it)... used to make a protein pancake with egg whites from 4 to 5 lg eggs, some pumpkin (not always), 1/2 c oatmeal, sweetener, blend and make it in a pan. Not sexy, not super palatable to those of us used to eating better tasting pancakes, but man were they good when you're \"desperate\". When I could tolerate sucralose, I used to get the sucralose based syrups and would put that over it, or just a little bit of jam, or pb... Sorry... been missing it, so maybe I should get my behind on it. LOL",

I stopped by a store on my commute and grabbed a small jar of PB to have later with toast. I put the jar on my desk when I got in. Shortly after my neighbour colleague (NC) (who's also my super and keeps/eats snacks at his desk) said hi and asked about my morning. I didn't have much to report other than forgetting and buying PB so I told him that. He pointed to my jar and said \"Is that what you eat?\" I knew from his tone he did not approve of my name-brand PB. I said, \"yeah, I know it's not as good for you as the 100% pure PB but I eat it.\" He scoffed and implied the PB was full of crap ingredients, saying it \"would last 20 years.\" We were interrupted by another colleague, but 10 minutes later I received an email with the subject: Peanut butter recommendation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis message read: \"The crunchy is really, really crunchy so we (meaning NC and his gf) buy smooth. (Local PB brand) is waaay better than (name brand); it's made in (local area). A little more expensive, yah, but worth it.\" He then included a link to the PB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole \"this is what we buy\" comment and fact he sent an unsolicited recommendation about PB is gross. I tried to shake it off by speaking up - since he sits six-feet from me - and simply say \"Thanks for the recommendation.\" He turned to tell me how the local product is superior to what I consume. The problem was it came off as a personal attack (a kind of 'How could you put that in your body' type thing) compared to stating his opinion or giving product info? A 2nd colleague jumped in and said, \"DYK (name brand) takes the peanut oil out of its PB and replaces it with soybean oil?\" I didn't mind b/c I felt his comment was genuinely informative however, I was losing patience. I expressed how it was unfortunate that I felt I had to justify my food at work and said to NC: \"it's clear you find what I eat disgusting.\" He made a grimace and nodded before turning to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's where I might be the AH b/c I was so frustrated (I wanted to throw my PB in the garbage) and genuinely hurt (two people railed me for being so foolish to buy this PB) that I hit reply to NC's recommendation and wrote:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Hi (NC), I would be doing myself and our relationship as teammates a disservice if I wasn't honest about how this really made me feel: incredibly judged. \"Is that what you eat?\" was condescending. And to follow with an email \"recommending\" what I eat is patronizing and snobby. I appreciate info on health and nutrition but I don't feel you intended to inform, only judge. In my view, your comments have created a toxic environment where I'm not comfortable eating certain foods. I would appreciate if you took care to acknowledge that diet is a reflection of personal and cultural identity. It's hurtful and harmful for you to express disgust at my food choices.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid I take it too far?",

(Local PB brand) is waaay better than (name brand); it's made in (local area). A little more expensive, yah, but worth it.\" He then included a link to the PB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole \"this is what we buy\" comment and fact he sent an unsolicited recommendation about PB is gross. I tried to shake it off by speaking up - since he sits six-feet from me - and simply say \"Thanks for the recommendation.\" He turned to tell me how the local product is superior to what I consume. The problem was it came off as a personal attack (a kind of 'How could you put that in your body' type thing) compared to stating his opinion or giving product info? A 2nd colleague jumped in and said, \"DYK (name brand) takes the peanut oil out of its PB and replaces it with soybean oil?\" I didn't mind b/c I felt his comment was genuinely informative however, I was losing patience. I expressed how it was unfortunate that I felt I had to justify my food at work and said to NC: \"it's clear you find what I eat disgusting.\" He made a grimace and nodded before turning to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's where I might be the AH b/c I was so frustrated (I wanted to throw my PB in the garbage) and genuinely hurt (two people railed me for being so foolish to buy this PB) that I hit reply to NC's recommendation and wrote:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Hi (NC), I would be doing myself and our relationship as teammates a disservice if I wasn't honest about how this really made me feel: incredibly judged. \"Is that what you eat?\" was condescending. And to follow with an email \"recommending\" what I eat is patronizing and snobby. I appreciate info on health and nutrition but I don't feel you intended to inform, only judge. In my view, your comments have created a toxic environment where I'm not comfortable eating certain foods. I would appreciate if you took care to acknowledge that diet is a reflection of personal and cultural identity. It's hurtful and harmful for you to express disgust at my food choices.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid I take it too far?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body": "Incoming long post, tl;dr at the bottom. I realize fast food isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I hope that some of you will be willing to go on this journey with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a while now, I have been looking to recreate what is by far my favorite breakfast food. As someone who worked at a McDonald's for years in my youth and took full advantage of the free food offered during shifts I know the taste and texture of the McGriddle better than anyone I know.\n\nI've looked at every \"copycat\" recipe out there (I even have a google alert set up for new ones as they come out) and have been met with nothing but disappointment. They all suffer from the problem that all alleged copycat recipes suffer from. With authors making statements from \"It's just a round pancake\" to starting off with \"I've never eaten a McGriddle but...\", everyone seems to be missing the point.\n\nFirst and foremost: **I don't want to make an** ***elevated*** **\"McGriddle\", or something you could pass off as one to someone who hasn't had it in 5 years. I want to make a McGriddle.** (this isn't to say that I'm not willing to make sacrifices in processes that are not available to the home chef, or substitute/omit ingredients that would only work on an industrial scale or are not important to flavor/texture)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Texture/Flavor\n\nTo anyone who has never tried a McGriddle, [here's a closeup](https://imgur.com/0yLr6ni) and a view of the top:  [view of the top](https://imgur.com/GKId2MC)\n\nMcDonald's describes the McGriddle as having \"... a resilient outside surface with a slightly chewy, moist center that breaks down easily in the mouth with a dense pancake texture and hints of syrup\" and the griddle cake is a \"Light golden brown with dark brown maple spots\".\n\nIf you've never had one I obviously recommend it. It tastes like a thick, moist \"pancake\" that is somehow both absolutely saturated in maple syrup flavor, but not in any way wet. You could squeeze it in a paper towel and you would barely get a few drops of liquid coming out of it.\n\nImportantly, unlike most pancakes I've had, there isn't a \"crust\" to it. The top and bottom are browned, but still springy and not at all hard. \n\nTexture is the part I've had the most trouble with, either too much rising, or too hard of a crust. I've had the best results with overmixing to maximize gluten formation. I also know that they arrive to the stores frozen and are cooked directly from frozen (although not as a frozen batter, so they are already at least partially cooked prior to shipping). If anyone has any thoughts on this (or other techniques to make denser batter) I would love to hear them.**^(1)**\n\n# Ingredients\n\nWhile most copycat recipes involve boiling down maple syrup to a softball stage, so you can put little balls of semi-solid syrup into regular pancake batter and have them melt without dissolving, something I find interesting is that the McGriddle doesn't actually have anything I recognize as \"maple\" flavored in it.\n\nIngredients from the website:\n\n>Water, Enriched Flour (bleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Sugar, Dextrose, Palm Oil  \n>  \n>Contains 2% Or Less: Brown Sugar, Baking Powder (baking Soda, Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate, Monocalcium Phosphate), Modified Tapioca Starch, Rice Flour, Whey Powder, Salt, Natural Flavors, Buttermilk Powder, Soybean Oil, Caramel Color, Soy Lecithin.\n\nInspired by J. Kenji López-Alt's [Serious Eats article on reconstructing his favorite In-N-Out burger](https://www.seriouseats.com/in-n-outs-double-double-animal-style-burger-recipe). From this list of ingredients, cross referenced with the nutritional information provided by McDonald's I have been able to calculate the precise ratios of the five primary ingredients. Since I also know the weight of a McGriddle, the only thing left is to figure out the function of the ingredients that make up 2% or less of the weight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the food science front, the things I'm most unsure about the purpose of are**^(2)**:\n\n* Dextrose\\*\n* Modified tapioca starch\n* Whey powder\n* Soy Lecithin (I think this just acts as a preservative here, but I'm not sure)\n\n\\* I was able to find [Maple Flavored Sugar](https://www.olivenation.com/maple-flavored-sugar.html), which is a combination of powdered dextrose and maple flavor (which could be the \"Natural Flavors\" in the ingredient list) so I'm assuming that dextrose is used here not to flavor the batter itself, but in the dark \"maple\" inclusions. This is my next lead to explore.\n\nI found an interview with the creator of the McGriddle that said:\n\n>... the only little piece of technology we needed was how do you get the syrup inside the pancakes so you don’t have to have syrup in one hand, sandwich in the other... We worked hard to get those little syrup crystals, and once we had that, McGriddles happened really quickly.\n\nWhich led me to discover that they sell \"maple crystals\", but I'm not sure that they would melt on their own, without being at least partially dissolved in something.\n\nNotably, there are also no eggs in a McGriddle, which is probably key to their dense, chewy texture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help or thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n**^(1)** How can I get a chewy \"pancake-like\" batter (using the listed ingredients) and cook the batter through with minimal rising and no hard exterior crust.\n\n**^(2)** What do dextrose, modified tapioca starch, whey powder do and where can I learn more about how they behave in baking/candymaking applications.",

Its purpose is also, as you said, to create the \"maple pancake\" flavor without necessitating too much water.\n\n2b) Modified tapioca starch doesn't break down when frozen and gelatinizes at lower temperatures. In plain English, it makes them freeze, reheat, and retain moisture better. It holds \\~5x its weight in water. 100g tapioca starch will gelatinize and bind 500g of water.\n\n2c) Whey powder is essentially dry milk without the sugar. It's a good source of protein, and is likely being used for its texture.\n\nNow then.\n\n1) To get a chewy pancake texture, you'd ideally supplement the flour with starch and cook it at a lower temperature to prevent the shell from forming. If you want to soften the \"shell\", literally just throw them in a towel like you keep tortillas warm in for a minute. To decrease rising, you'll want to reduce the amount of leavening used.\n\nStarting point for dry pancake batter:\n\n2 cups AP flour, 2tsp baking powder, 1/4tsp salt, 1tbsp sugar (optional), 2 eggs, milk to adjust\n\nTo modify for the McGriddle, at least as I'd take a wild guess-\n\n2 cups AP flour, 1tbsp tapioca starch, 1tsp baking powder, 1/4tsp salt, 2tsp maple sugar to start, 1tbsp of whey powder, and milk to get it to the right batter texture.

I like the Joshua way of soft maple candy but it’s not gonna melt in IMO like the originals. My first thought was this. Years ago I recall watching or reading a science/food article or recipe where they made soda pearls. So same concept may work with maple syrup. Basically a shortened explanation they mixed plain gelatin and cola then used an eye dropper and dropped tiny drops of the mixture into a light oil. I don’t recall after that. But I would think it would need to be chilled and given time to set up then scoop out your pearls and roll in a towel to remove some oil. The rest remaining would mix in with the pancake and help heat the pearls to burst or melt. I’ll be trying this soon once my corn dog maker comes in lol. Will try to update with ohotos",

The adrenaline junkie type traders of the day were probably there in the trenches trying to figure out if they'd survive or not and placing their hot bets, \"betting on the outcome\".\n\nBuffett actually invested after the scandal was totally resolved and it was clear that AmEx was going to survive.  The stock was up off of its lows but still 30\\-40&#37; below fair value.  The stock didn't pop back up to fair value but just recovered a little but still had a ways to go.  This is one of the most important lessons in investing I have ever read.  While Buffett didn't buy at the bottom, he bought at a time when the risk\\-adjusted returns were far better than when the stock was at the bottom, because more information was known and the scandal was already resolved, and the stock was still absurdly cheap.  This is what allowed Buffett to put 40&#37; of the net worth of his and his partners in it. He didn't take some wild risk investing in a scandal, he waited for the dust to settle and then moved in.  This is a great lesson for anyone who wishes to bet on distressed situations.",

    "body": "Spoiler alert: it works! \n\nSomeone asked me to summarize what I wrote on a previous post in response to a study that demonstrated a drramatic fat loss of a woman with lipedema using keto. \n\nIn short, I have lipedema.  I tried everything to lose fat from my legs. Calorie restriction and rigorous workouts did nothing. I continued to actually gain weight. I initially tried keto and intermittent fasting. I ate a lot of salads. I was not getting the type of results most people get. I was using salad dressing full of soybean oil until I read emerging, compelling evidence that shows vegetable oils such as soybean and canola oils drive inflammation.( Just to note: avocado, olive and coconut oil appear to be okay, at least so far.).\nInflammation is indicated to worsen lipedema, so I wanted to make sure I reduced everything that might contribute to that. I decided to start eating nothing but meat, butter, eggs, some chicken, a little fatty fish, like salmon and occasionally pork. No processed foods anymore and no toxic oils.  No dairy and no cheese. I combined this with fasts that I varied depending on how I felt but on average, I did 3 to 4  72hr fasts per month with some 36 and 48 hour fasts in the mix at least once a week. I also did fasts where I just ate every other day and occasionally just a 20 to 24 hour fasts. It was relatively easy once I got into it. I lost weight very quickly. A little over 30 pounds! And my thighs and calves were noticeably smaller! \n\nA lot of people look at women and think they are just fat and it is because they lack willpower. For women with lipedema, this is simply tragic and not at all true. If you are a woman who has big thighs and calves and sometimes arms and can't lose weight or \"tone\" these areas, I want you to know there might be a medical reason. Lipedema is very common and it is estimated to effect between 11 to 20% of ALL women! Possibly more. Once you know the symptoms, you literally see women with this condition EVERYWHERE. The medical community is not up to date on this and most doctors just assume someone is fat. Simple calorie restriction is ineffective. There seems to be an interplay between inflammation and hormones like insulin and estrogen that drive this disease so balancing hormones and eliminating inflammation can help tremendously as well as stop the disease progression.",

I wanted to support this post  by saying I've experienced a similar Lipedema fat loss due to a \\~72 hour fast - although unintentionally. I was sick twice over a period of 4 years. Both the times I was sick for 6-8 days and was unable to eat any food for 3-4 days. I lost about \\~8-10 lbs of the lipedema fat during each sickness bringing me down a total of \\~20 lbs lipedema fat loss in my legs and feet (even my shoe size dropped by 1 size). I'm explicitly calling out lipedema fat since the other fat, in my personal experience, has been manageable to lose.\n\nAfter 3 years since enjoying my life post the fat loss, I put it all back on due to a stressful year that caused hormone imbalances coupled with unhealthy lifestyle coping mechanisms (delivery takeouts, binge eating, no exercise etc). I've tried every other method for losing the lipedemda fat but haven't been successful. I would love to do the 72 hour fast method - hopefully without falling sick again haha - but haven't been able to fast beyond 20 hours. Tips and guidances would be very much appreciated!\n\nThanks again for sharing your experiences.",

I ordered it during the VIB sale, and this is NOT the same moisturizer!! It is white instead of green, has a strange smell, and feels heavy now.\n\nI was willing to overlook that, but now I’m breaking out all over my face. I keep seeing similar stories online from other people using the new formula. Somebody said they were bought out by L’Oréal and reformulated the moisturizer to have soybean oil in it now, which is known to be comedogenic. I’m so upset that my ride or die product that I have used consistently for the last 7 years is now ruined! I never expected to have to return this, but I’m gonna have to.\n\nDo you guys recommend any other similar moisturizers? Something oil free, non comedogenic but decently hydrating? I am acne prone but have dry, dehydrated skin from living in a dry climate. \n\nCan we all just bully YTTP into bringing back the old formulation? It somewhat worked with Glossier, they released some BDC’s with the old formula. ",

    "body": "Email 1:\n\nAt Fleishers, we look for firm, not floppy pork. It's what it sounds like: firm pork stands up and presents well in the meat case, while floppy pork slumps. But more importantly, firm pork indicates that the pigs were fed small grains (like barley and peas), while floppy pork was fed a corn-dominated diet. \n\nWhy does this matter? Floppy pork is much higher in polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), and these levels have been steadily increasing over time. Pigs do not make PUFA naturally; they must get them through their diet, such as through corn and spent distiller grains used by conventional pork farmers. The result is pork that is lower in saturated fat and higher in PUFA. This means pork that is soft and greasy, without distinct marbling, bacon that is difficult to slice, and sausage that looks like it's smeared with fat. On the flip side, if you feed pigs low PUFA grains, such as barley, peas, wheat, and triticale (a wheat/rye hybrid), you will get firm, low PUFA pork. You'll see a clear definition between lean meat and fat, and the pork is bright red, well-marbled, firm, and easy to cut.\n\nAt Fleishers, we own all of our pigs and provide them with non-GMO feed, carefully formulated from Fleishers Mills. This means we not only manage the pasture and husbandry protocols for raising our pork, we can also provide feeds with low PUFA content. Our animals receive the right balance of omega-3 fatty acids (from pasture and forage) to omega-6 fatty acids (from grains). Does it make a difference? The proof is in the data. Our pork lard has been tested at only 6% PUFA, compared to the USDA average of 11.2%, with some corn-fed samples reaching as high as 30%!\n\nStay tuned for a subsequent issue on why you should avoid PUFA, and its effects on your liver. And stop by and pick up some firm, properly raised pork tonight!\n\nEmail 2:\n\nFleishers takes pride in having firm, not floppy pork, which indicates that the pork was primarily fed small grains (like barley and peas) rather than corn. It also means the pork will be lower in polyunsaturated fats, and higher in saturated fats. (Our pork lard has been tested at only 6% polyunsaturated fats, compared to the USDA average of 11.2%, and some corn-dominant samples reach as high as 30%!) But why exactly does this matter, and how does it affect your health?\n\nLet's back up to define the various types of fats. Saturated fats are dominant in animal products (meat, butter, cream) and solid at room temperature, while polyunsaturated fats (corn oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil) and mono-unsaturated fats (olive oil, nuts, canola oil) are liquid at room temperature. Saturated fats have no double bonds and are chemically very stable. Polyunsaturated fats, on the other hand, have two or more double bonds, and these bonds are prone to oxidation. This means polyunsaturated fats are prone to causing oxidative stress, which damages cellular proteins, DNA, and more. Oxidized polyunsaturated fats have also been linked to liver disease.\n\nMeanwhile, conventional wisdom holds that saturated fats are not as healthy as mono- or polyunsaturated fats; this is the advice given by the American Heart Association. However, in 2016, unpublished data from the Minnesota Coronary Experiment of 1968-73 was re-evaluated, and researchers concluded that replacing saturated fats with vegetable oils does not reduce the risk of death from heart disease. More recent literature reviews have concluded that the role of saturated fats in causing cardiac disease has been greatly exaggerated (NCBI, NPR).\n\nAdditional research should be done, but if saturated fats haven't been proven to be correlated with heart disease AND the firm pork that results from feeding pigs a low polyunsaturated fat diet is more flavorful and higher quality, then we think this is a winning situation!\n\nPretty neat eh?",

Peas are also low in sugars, high in fiber, and low in sugar. \n\nBasically by feeding the pigs a high fiber, low sugar diet, they are getting healthier animals that don’t have the negative fats from feeding them corn (which gives them high sugar and corn oil fats). \n\nI do think their pigs are probably much healthier. But if they also fed them fish oil supplements (or equivalently healthy supplements like flax seed with the barley) which both have known healthy unsaturated fats, the pigs they produce would still be healthier than corn fed pigs and have more of a unsaturated fat profile. Shit, if they added flax to their barley I’d send away for their meat. \n\nI guess I just disagree with their framing and how they tried to say PUFA were bad without specifying that some were bad and some are fine.",

So earlier, I went to the grocery store to pick up some things and grab lunch from the deli. After grabbing what I needed, I went over to order a wrap from the deli.\n\nNow, daughter has a dairy and soy allergy. That means I can't eat any dairy products (not even lactose free) and nothing soy (soybean oil doesn't bother some, but it seems to upset her so I'm always careful to ask). If I do eat either of these products, the munchkin gets an upset stomach, becomes very fussy and bloated, and just generally feels awful.\n\nSo as I'm getting ready to order, I ask the lady making my wrap to check the ingredients on the tortilla before she made it to make sure there was no soy or dairy. And let me tell you, it was like pulling teeth to get her to check! She told me she didn't know and, instead of checking the package that was arms reach from her, she asked another deli employee who said the same thing: \"I don't know\".\n\nEventually, instead of checking, they went and got their manager who FINALLY looked over the package and told me that there wasn't either allergen in there. I asked if I could look at the package just to make sure, because she kinda skimmed over it, and they told me no, that they checked, they couldn't let me see. Okay, weird, but I stupidly took their word for it.\n\nSo fast forward to about 7:30 and daughter starts crying her eyes out. And, because I'm her mama, I recognize that cry as the \"my tummy really hurts\" cry. So, out of a hunch, I checked the ingredients on the brand of wrap they used... Sure enough, soybean oil is one of the top ingredients. Even though I was told it wasn't (after almost having to beg for them to check).\n\nSo now I'm having to try to comfort my two month old daughter who is in pain because three employees couldn't be bothered to do their job. I worked there in the past. And let me tell you, they train you MUCH BETTER than the way those employees acted today. You can bet I am going up there tomorrow to speak with the store manager. What if someone had a life threatening allergy? They would be in the hospital or worse because of their carelessness. I'm just so damn angry right now yall. ",

The manager likes to think that it should all end with him, but go to corporate. Corporate DOES NOT like this sort of publicity, so call their line and make a complaint. And make it a BIG deal. Like ask for names of who you talked to, etc. This will make corporate come down hard on the store manager. \n\nThen the store manager will call you. And you want him to call you, because he's had some time to mull over the situation, be yelled at by all of his district and regional supervisors, find an excellent solution to the issue (maybe) and present you with his offer. Maybe free groceries could be in your future. Give the manager 1-2 days to call you after lodging your very angry complaint with corporate. \n\nKeep your receipt. Most corporations have a little survey on them. After the manager has either dealt with or not dealt with this situation in a manner you deem acceptable (or not) then you take the survey. \n\nOnly 5/5 gets them full marks. Anything else is a 0. They're all graded this way, either pass or fail. If the manager does really well handling it, then give him the 5's. It makes him look better to his manager for handling it well. If not, well, then he gets yelled at by district and regional managers again for not handling it appropriately. And they don't like that.",

Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.), calling it the “Louisiana MAHA bill”—a reference to his own “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) agenda that aims to crack down on food colorants, food additives, and seed oils.\nPer Senate Bill 14, beginning in 2028, Louisiana public schools and nonpublic school receiving state funds will be prohibited from serving in school breakfasts, lunches, and aftercare meals any foods containing one of 15 ingredients:\n\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Azodicarbonamide (ADA)\n- Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)\n- Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)\n- Potassium bromate\n- Propylparaben\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Aspartame\n- Sucralose\n\n\nThe prohibition does not apply to foods sold in vending machines or at concession stands.\nSenate Bill 14 also contains a provision for the disclosure of “harmful ingredients,” which requires labeling of food products to disclose when they contain one of 40+ ingredients, beginning in 2028. The bill also requires foodservice establishments to display disclaimers on their menus or in a visible location when they prepare foods with seed oils (i.e., canola/rapeseed, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils).\n\nRegarding the ingredient disclosure provision, manufacturers must label foods containing any of 40+ ingredients with a QR code directing consumers to a webpage that displays the following disclaimer: “NOTICE: This product contains [ingredient]. For more information about this ingredient, including FDA approvals, click HERE.” The disclaimer must link to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) webpage on food chemical safety. The 40+ ingredients covered by this provision are:\n\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Acetylated esters of mono- and diglycerides (acetic acid ester)\n- Anisole\n- Aspartame\n- ADA\n- BHA\n- BHT\n- Bleached flour\n- Bromated flour\n- Calcium bromate\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Diacetyl\n- Dimethylamylamine (DMAA)\n- Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS)\n- Interesterified palm oil\n- Interesterified soybean oil\n- Lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol\n- Lye\n- Morpholine\n- Olestra\n- Partially hydrogenated oil (PHO)\n- Propylparaben\n- Sodium aluminum sulfate\n- Sodium lauryl sulfate\n- Sodium stearyl fumarate\n- Stearyl tartrate\n- Sucralose\n- Synthetic trans fatty acid\n- Thiodipropionic acid\n- Toluene\n- Potassium aluminum sulfate\n- Potassium bromate\n- Potassium iodate\n- Propylene oxide\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Citrus red dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Certified food colors by FDA\n\nAlthough several states have passed bills inspired by MAHA in recent months—such as Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia—the movement is controversial. Some stakeholders have disputed MAHA claims, calling them “an oversimplification without a clear understanding of the myriad complexities facing the production of safe and nutritious foods” that “ignores current food and animal food regulatory systems designed to promote public and animal health.”",

Maybe a carnivore person would be, idk, but 99% of experts will agree those monounsaturated fats are 👍\n\nAs far as the rest, I personally decided there isn’t enough of a benefit for me to eat vegetable oil when I can use avocado oil… no reason to eat canola when olive oil is right there. But I’m not sure that I am totally convinced by the available research that they are severely harmful, so I don’t go to great lengths to keep the intake at 0 (i’d never be able to eat at a restaurant again if that was my goal). I’m just erring on the cautious side by not consuming them frequently.\n\nRecently, Max Lugavere (a science journalist who is anti-seed oils, and who I like and respect but do feel he is as guilty of cherry picking as the next guy) had Bill Harris on his show to discuss omega-3s (Bill Harris is a leading researcher on omega 3s). They disagreed on the harm regarding seed oils, both very respectfully and it was a good convo. If interested, you can find the episode on Max’s podcast “The Genius Life,” episode 262. I wont try to paraphrase here because I will botch stats.\n\nBasically, the point I am trying to make is you can likely find info to confirm your bias either direction. \n\nPeople used to say not to heat olive oil but data is showing that’s actually fine to do. Smoke point doesn’t mean it’s breaking down like people used to believe.\n\nhttps://health.usnews.com/wellness/food/articles/why-you-should-stop-worrying-about-olive-oils-smoke-points",

        "body": "This is purely an online argument. Every leading healthy body and all government guidelines advise PUFA heavy (moreso the seed oils) lipids than SFA heavy ones (butter, ghee, lard, coconut, palm). This is not an appeal to authority, it's to explain there is no debate in the expert communities because the evidence is abundantly clear. Here follows a 2020 Cochrane meta-analysis of RCTs:\n\n> [The findings of this updated review suggest that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years causes a potentially important reduction in combined cardiovascular events. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate appear to be useful strategies, while effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat are unclear. The reduction in combined cardiovascular events resulting from reducing saturated fat did not alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk, but greater reduction in saturated fat caused greater reductions in cardiovascular events.](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011737.pub2/full)\n\nTo precede a (somehow) popular criticism saying these studies did not find a reduction in actual mortality; that is because the median length of these trials was around 5 years. Heart disease is a chronic disease taking decades to develop. This criticism rests on the assumption that having a heart attack or other cardiovascular events doesn't correlate *at all* with later mortality. I.E Heart attacks are no big deal and do not affect your life expectancy.\n\nClearly, this is a silly position to take and anyone considering it should take a little while to think about what they're saying.\n\nLinoleic acid is typically the target for anti-seed oil arguments. They say it can oxidize, that the processing is very scary and has lots of 'chemicals' etc... Basically all speculative. Let's see what happens to populations that eat the most LA (confirmed by actual serum levels in several of the cohorts in this meta-analysis):\n\n> [In prospective cohort studies, higher LA intake, assessed by dietary surveys or biomarkers, was associated with a modestly lower risk of mortality from all causes, CVD, and cancer. These data support the potential long-term benefits of PUFA intake in lowering the risk of CVD and premature death.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32020162/)\n\nNote that this isn't, like the previous study, just the benefit of PUFA over SFA. But the benefit of PUFA (and LA) *alone*. So it doesn't stand on its feet just compared to a worse lipid, it provides benefits in the absolute sense.\n\n[Here is an essay from 2021 that exhaustively covers every single claim against seed oils.](https://www.the-nutrivore.com/post/a-comprehensive-rebuttal-to-seed-oil-sophistry). Within you can find the nuance that leaves room to defend SFAs and the very poor logic people use to demonize PUFAs. SFAs have a sigmoidal relationship with CVD. Around the 8-10% of calories mark they show a marked increase in CVD events which tapers off. Like cigarettes, there's diminishing returns eventually. So if I showed you that 3 pack a day smokers suffered almost identically to 2 pack a day smokers, you wouldn't be quick to believe that that makes smoking ok. You would know enough to wonder if the difference in exposure was not large enough. Maintain that for SFAs and you'll see through a lot of the sophism.\n\nSo how is this such a big deal if the evidence is so clear? I don't know! When it comes down to it, there's always a requirement for a very high level conspiracy. Typically around LDL and statins. Some enormous collusion between the scientific community. Which undermines all science of course. If that is the premise and the same person then presents some scientific papers to support their argument... Well, you can't have both of those.",

    "body": "*What are your thoughts on this?*\n\n**World renowned heart surgeon Dr. Dwight Lundell speaks out on what really causes heart disease**\n\nDr. Dwight Lundell: \n\nWe physicians with all our training, knowledge and authority often acquire a rather large ego that tends to make it difficult to admit we are wrong. So, here it is. I freely admit to being wrong. As a heart surgeon with 25 years experience, having performed over 5,000 open-heart surgeries, today is my day to right the wrong with medical and scientific fact.\n\nI trained for many years with other prominent physicians labelled “opinion makers.” Bombarded with scientific literature, continually attending education seminars, we opinion makers insisted heart disease resulted from the simple fact of elevated blood cholesterol.\n\nThe only accepted therapy was prescribing medications to lower cholesterol and a diet that severely restricted fat intake. The latter of course we insisted would lower cholesterol and heart disease. Deviations from these recommendations were considered heresy and could quite possibly result in malpractice.\n\nIt Is Not Working!\n\nThese recommendations are no longer scientifically or morally defensible. The discovery a few years ago that inflammation in the artery wall is the real cause of heart disease is slowly leading to a paradigm shift in how heart disease and other chronic ailments will be treated.\n\nThe long-established dietary recommendations have created epidemics of obesity and diabetes, the consequences of which dwarf any historical plague in terms of mortality, human suffering and dire economic consequences.\n\nDespite the fact that 25% of the population takes expensive statin medications and despite the fact we have reduced the fat content of our diets, more Americans will die this year of heart disease than ever before.\n\nStatistics from the American Heart Association show that 75 million Americans currently suffer from heart disease, 20 million have diabetes and 57 million have pre-diabetes. These disorders are affecting younger and younger people in greater numbers every year.\n \nSimply stated, without inflammation being present in the body, there is no way that cholesterol would accumulate in the wall of the blood vessel and cause heart disease and strokes. Without inflammation, cholesterol would move freely throughout the body as nature intended. It is inflammation that causes cholesterol to become trapped.\n\nInflammation is not complicated — it is quite simply your body’s natural defence to a foreign invader such as a bacteria, toxin or virus. The cycle of inflammation is perfect in how it protects your body from these bacterial and viral invaders. However, if we chronically expose the body to injury by toxins or foods the human body was never designed to process,a condition occurs called chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is just as harmful as acute inflammation is beneficial.\n\nWhat thoughtful person would willfully expose himself repeatedly to foods or other substances that are known to cause injury to the body? Well,smokers perhaps, but at least they made that choice willfully.\n\nThe rest of us have simply followed the recommended mainstream diet that is low in fat and high in polyunsaturated fats and carbohydrates, not knowing we were causing repeated injury to our blood vessels. This repeated injury creates chronic inflammation leading to heart disease, stroke, diabetes and obesity.\n\nLet me repeat that: The injury and inflammation in our blood vessels is caused by the low fat diet recommended for years by mainstream medicine.\n\nWhat are the biggest culprits of chronic inflammation? Quite simply, they are the overload of simple, highly processed carbohydrates (sugar, flour and all the products made from them) and the excess consumption of omega-6 vegetable oils like soybean, corn and sunflower that are found in many processed foods.\n\nTake a moment to visualize rubbing a stiff brush repeatedly over soft skin until it becomes quite red and nearly bleeding. you kept this up several times a day, every day for five years. If you could tolerate this painful brushing, you would have a bleeding, swollen infected area that became worse with each repeated injury. This is a good way to visualize the inflammatory process that could be going on in your body right now.\n\nRegardless of where the inflammatory process occurs, externally or internally, it is the same. I have peered inside thousands upon thousands of arteries. A diseased artery looks as if someone took a brush and scrubbed repeatedly against its wall. Several times a day, every day, the foods we eat create small injuries compounding into more injuries, causing the body to respond continuously and appropriately with inflammation.\n\nWhile we savor the tantalizing taste of a sweet roll, our bodies respond alarmingly as if a foreign invader arrived declaring war. Foods loaded with sugars and simple carbohydrates, or processed with omega-6 oils for long shelf life have been the mainstay of the American diet for six decades. These foods have been slowly poisoning everyone.\n\nHow does eating a simple sweet roll create a cascade of inflammation to make you sick?\n\nImagine spilling syrup on your keyboard and you have a visual of what occurs inside the cell. When we consume simple carbohydrates such as sugar, blood sugar rises rapidly. In response, your pancreas secretes insulin whose primary purpose is to drive sugar into each cell where it is stored for energy. If the cell is full and does not need glucose, it is rejected to avoid extra sugar gumming up the works.\n\nWhen your full cells reject the extra glucose, blood sugar rises producing more insulin and the glucose converts to stored fat.\n\nWhat does all this have to do with inflammation? Blood sugar is controlled in a very narrow range. Extra sugar molecules attach to a variety of proteins that in turn injure the blood vessel wall. This repeated injury to the blood vessel wall sets off inflammation. When you spike your blood sugar level several times a day, every day, it is exactly like taking sandpaper to the inside of your delicate blood vessels.\n\nWhile you may not be able to see it, rest assured it is there. I saw it in over 5,000 surgical patients spanning 25 years who all shared one common denominator — inflammation in their arteries.\n\nLet’s get back to the sweet roll. That innocent looking goody not only contains sugars, it is baked in one of many omega-6 oils such as soybean. Chips and fries are soaked in soybean oil; processed foods are manufactured with omega-6 oils for longer shelf life. While omega-6’s are essential -they are part of every cell membrane controlling what goes in and out of the cell — they must be in the correct balance with omega-3’s.\n \nIf the balance shifts by consuming excessive omega-6, the cell membrane produces chemicals called cytokines that directly cause inflammation.\n\nToday’s mainstream American diet has produced an extreme imbalance of these two fats. The ratio of imbalance ranges from 15:1 to as high as 30:1 in favor of omega-6. That’s a tremendous amount of cytokines causing inflammation. In today’s food environment, a 3:1 ratio would be optimal and healthy.\n\nTo make matters worse, the excess weight you are carrying from eating these foods creates overloaded fat cells that pour out large quantities of pro-inflammatory chemicals that add to the injury caused by having high blood sugar. The process that began with a sweet roll turns into a vicious cycle over time that creates heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and finally, Alzheimer’s disease, as the inflammatory process continues unabated.\n\nThere is no escaping the fact that the more we consume prepared and processed foods, the more we trip the inflammation switch little by little each day. The human body cannot process, nor was it designed to consume, foods packed with sugars and soaked in omega-6 oils.\n\nThere is but one answer to quieting inflammation, and that is returning to foods closer to their natural state. To build muscle, eat more protein. Choose carbohydrates that are very complex such as colorful fruits and vegetables. Cut down on or eliminate inflammation- causing omega-6 fats like corn and soybean oil and the processed foods that are made from them.\n\nOne tablespoon of corn oil contains 7,280 mg of omega-6; soybean contains 6,940 mg. Instead, use olive oil or butter from grass-fed beef.\n\nAnimal fats contain less than 20% omega-6 and are much less likely to cause inflammation than the supposedly healthy oils labelled polyunsaturated. Forget the “science” that has been drummed into your head for decades. The science that saturated fat alone causes heart disease is non-existent. The science that saturated fat raises blood cholesterol is also very weak. Since we now know that cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease, the concern about saturated fat is even more absurd today.\n\nThe cholesterol theory led to the no-fat, low-fat recommendations that in turn created the very foods now causing an epidemic of inflammation. Mainstream medicine made a terrible mistake when it advised people to avoid saturated fat in favor of foods high in omega-6 fats. We now have an epidemic of arterial inflammation leading to heart disease and other silent killers.\n\nWhat you can do is choose whole foods your grandmother served and not those your mom turned to as grocery store aisles filled with manufactured foods. By eliminating inflammatory foods and adding essential nutrients from fresh unprocessed food, you will reverse years of damage in your arteries and throughout your body from consuming the typical American diet.\n\nDr. Dwight Lundell is the past Chief of Staff and Chief of Surgery at Banner Heart Hospital , Mesa , AZ. His private practice, Cardiac Care Center was in Mesa, AZ. Recently Dr. Lundell left surgery to focus on the nutritional treatment of heart disease.

Saturated fat becomes a solid at cooler temperatures. LA remains liquidl until it gets much much colder. this is important for plants, fish, and cold blooded animals. If the fat in a plant or insect or animal becomes solid, it won't be able to move across cell membranes and blood vessels \n\nBut because LA is associated with cold weather, when plants make nuts and seeds and grains - these foods are loaded with PUFA and LA. These nuts, seeds and grains usually become available in late summer and fall.\n\nWhen the animals eat these nuts, seeds and grains in large amounts, they ingest a lot more LA than usual. the effect this has is that it signals the body to become insulin resistant, which causes the body to release more insulin to counteract the resistance.\n\nHigher insulin levels causes fat cells to take up more energy from the bloodstream (whereas the muscle cells don't want that energy)\n\nThis helps the animals because they become fat when food is abundant, and it also slows down their metabolism so they burn less calories. By having fat and a slower metabolism, they are more likely to survive a cold winter when it won't be as easy to find food.\n\nBy the time spring arrives, they should have burned through their fat stores and burned up their stores LA, at which point their insulin resistance goes down, and their metabolism goes back up",

One type, the type that seed oils are loaded with will breakdown poorly in the body causing damage to your body. Your body can’t use the fat well, and it also attacks the fat. Because your body doesn’t run on this fat well, it mucks up the machinery causing damage, and because your body is fighting it, it’s depleting a lot of resources that would otherwise be used to fight other things.\n\n\nMiddle school answer: When we cut open bodies today and look at the fat inside of you Timmy it’s crawling with white blood cells. You know those cells you learned about in science class that destroy the bad things in your body? Those white blood cells are fighting a threat in the area. But what would be the threat? That’s right Timmy, it’s the type of fat you’re storing, it’s unstable. Imagine a huge block of marble, pretty stable right? That thing’s not budging. Now cut the block of marble into big towers and arrange them like a row of dominos. Now knock one over, what will happen to the other dominos? That’s right, they all get knocked over. In that same way, all it takes is one of these unstable fat molecules to “oxidize” or get knocked over, and it causes a whole lotta damage just like the row of marble dominos. And the real problem is that your fat is loaded with the stuff, and it gets knocked over very easily! I know what you’re wondering, why are they oxidized so easily. Well Timmy, you’re going to need to take a chemistry class before you can get a real explanation, and good job on remembering the word oxidized.\n\n\nTo answer your questions. They’re pretty equally bad. They are carcinogenic in that they easily oxidize (on the scale of billions per second) into known carcinogens. They are responsible for weight gain due to cellular damage that leads to hormone disruption, most notably insulin resistance. They also just make you feel less full in general.",

        "body": "Seed oils are mostly polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) which are easily oxidized, and that causes damage to cells in a way that saturated fats simply can't; \"unsaturated\" means that it has bonds which are free to be oxidized, whereas saturated fats don't have any free bonds. \"Monounsaturated\" fats, like that in olive oil, are somewhere in the middle wrt being prone to oxidation, but typically they are less processed and still contain antioxidants that offset the risk of oxidation. (You should throw out old olive oil eventually though.) Almost all the seed oils we use come heavily processed and oxidized before they even get to us, too. \n\nThey're the primary class of oils used in deep fryers, so they're heavily oxidized VERY quickly. Oxidized oils taste bad, so if you've ever recognized from taste alone that the fry oil hasn't been changed in a while, you just ingested a LOT of oxidized fat. Old olive oil will taste off, too. By contrast, saturated fats like tallow or coconut oil will taste exactly the same for years, even when kept at room temperature, and can be fried again and again before degrading.\n\nSeed oils also contain a high amount of linoleic acid, a specific fatty acid that seems to trigger hibernation in mammals that hibernate and otherwise slows down the metabolism of mammals like us. Normally we would ingest seed oils in small amounts from seeds, nuts, etc during the fall and winter seasons, which helps us not to lose too much weight. But we're not roughing it in nature anymore, and we're eating concentrated and large amounts of these oils.\n\nSeed oils are also mostly omega 6 fatty acids, which skews the ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids and causes assorted health problems.\n\nIt is also not great for our cell linings to become more than 50/50 saturated fat and monounsaturated fat, but polyunsaturated fats from seed oils get incorporated into our cell membranes.\n\nNot all seed oils are created equal. For example, sesame oil is pretty fine; it's used sparingly as a condiment, and it's not heavily processed so it still contains a lot of antioxidants and other healthy compounds. Also, palm kernel oil is technically sort of a seed oil, but it's saturated fats.\n\nThere's also \"high oleic\" seed oils, such as \"high oleic sunflower oil.\" I think these are fine for most people; oleic oil is monounsaturated, and the fatty acid profile of such oils is similar to olive oil.\n\nYou might also want to know that while cows turn most fat they ingest into saturated fat, pigs and poultry will have fats high in linoleic acid and other PUFAs if they eat a diet high in those fats. In the United States, this is almost always the case. Whether you need to go so far as to avoid those is a person-by-person thing. You might find that cooking up one brand of chicken makes you feel like shit and another doesn't, or you just don't eat pork and chicken enough to worry much about it, etc.\n\nHope that helps.",

It provides zero nutritional benefits, contains no vitamins, and has a highly imbalanced omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, which is far from what the human body is designed to handle. In fact, humans have never evolved to consume such substances.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that this product is a major profit driver for large food corporations. These companies prioritize profit over environmental sustainability, relying on practices like child labor, low-wage work, and widespread deforestation to produce this cheap alternative that is unfit for human consumption.\n\nYou’ll find this ingredient in countless grocery store items, included to improve shelf stability, enhance appearance, and deter bacterial growth—not to benefit your health. The average person, unaware of these issues, may unknowingly consume nearly half a cup of seed oils daily from processed foods. Consider this: these chemicals didn’t exist 100 years ago. Humans thrived for thousands of years without them, yet now many condone consuming such substances regularly. Can your body really handle it? The evidence suggests otherwise. Many of these oils are linked to long-term health risks, including cancer.\n\nFor example, did you know that canola oil originated as a vehicle lubricant during World War II in Canada? When demand for the lubricant waned, it was rebranded as a cooking oil to sustain profits. Does that sound like something you want to consume?\n\nIt’s difficult to monopolize natural, unprocessed foods that anyone can produce, but manufactured, lab-created products are another story—they’re easy to control and highly profitable.\n\nThis is only the beginning. If you want to dig deeper into the science behind these claims, check out Paul Saladino, who references numerous peer-reviewed studies not funded by big food or pharmaceutical companies.\n\nFor me, this is a fight for awareness—a stand against being exploited or supporting those who prioritize greed over humanity. These corporations are not interested in our well-being; their only goal is to fill their pockets, even if it means causing direct harm to us and our children. I believe that in every aspect of life, we have a responsibility to choose what’s right—not what’s convenient, easy, or profitable for others.

These are molecules almost identical to cholesterol. In the body they can replace cholesterol but then not properly function. This can be as a precursor to hormones or being part of cell membranes. This is why vegetables oils lower LDL, because it impacts LDL synthesis.\n\nOur bodies are extremely selective in what they absorb. we absorb most of cholesterol but plant sterols, which can be only 1 methyl group different, we barley absorb, maybe 5% of what we eat. This high selectivity is a tell-tale evolutionary signal, that plant sterols are bad, we don't want them in our body.\n\nThere is a genetic mutation (Sitosterolemia) that makes the affected absorb way more of the plant sterols, like 15% or more. if they don't control their diet, they die early from severe heart disease and early can mean as kids. In short, plant sterols are very clearly very bad for us.\n\nAnd now in modern age, we consume so much seed oils, full of plant sterols, that the selectivness isn't good enough anymore. even the 5% coming through is too much over time. We consumed about 2% if calories from seeds, nuts and such, now it's 10% or higher, 5 times more which means 5 times more plant sterols.\n\nThat's why you should also be careful on a vegan diet. don't overdo coconut oil or cocoa butter.",

There’s a type of fat called linoleic acid (LA) that stays squishy even when it’s super cold, like how some oils don’t freeze easily. This is super helpful because if fats in plants, bugs, or fish got too hard, they couldn’t move around inside them, like a toy car stuck in ice.\n\nIn the summer and fall, plants like nuts, seeds, and grains make a lot of LA. Animals eat these foods, and it’s like their bodies get a special message: “Winter is coming! Get ready!” Their bodies start saving up energy by storing more fat, kind of like saving snacks for later. At the same time, their bodies also slow down, like when you take smaller steps to make your energy last longer.\n\nThis helps them survive the winter when it’s harder to find food. By spring, they’ve used up their fat and LA, and their bodies wake back up, ready to run around and find food again. Cool, huh?",

The cotton seeds, many years ago, were used to make lamp fuel for lighting before we had modern electricity.\n\nThen someone asked the question, \"I wonder how I could make money from this toxic waste?\"\n\nAnd that's exactly what a company called Crisco did. They turned this waste into a solid and sold it to people telling them they could cook their food with it so that they could make even more money.\n\nBut, they didn't tell people that it's not actually food and that it's not good for your body because it's made from a toxic waste.\n\nCrisco instead found ways to make toxic seeds oils out of even less expensive things, like soybeans, corn, and sunflowers to make it even less expensive for them to make and sell to people. These are what we see in the store today the cooking oil section.\n\nSo, seed oils are not food and will make you sick and unhealthy because when you eat them, your body says, \"What is this? This isn't food? I don't know what to do with this.\" And since your body doesn't know what to do with it, it makes you sick and not feel good.",

        "body": "Here are a few things that will help: \n1. Get some steel wool and fill any holes in the bathroom pipes with it. Like where the pipe comes out of the wall, if there’s any holes there. \n2. You could get some drain covers for your sink and shower, but taking them on and off would be annoying. \n3. Get some weather stripping for all your doors that lead outside. They have ones that you can cut to size and will stick on. They won’t last forever but they’ll last awhile. You could also get some you drill in, or you can put in a whole threshold if you’re up for it.  \n4. Be militant with food garbage. It sounds like your issues are in the bathroom so this doesn’t help as much, but don’t leave any food out. Take out the trash often if there’s food in it. \n5. Spray some Ortho home defense. It doesn’t work as well as getting a pro but you just have to do it more often, like once a month. Spray outside your door too and around any openings. \n6. You could probably find an exterminator company that will give you a good(ish) price on a regular service. You’ll just have to shop around a bit and maybe find someone independent. It sucks to spend money on it but if its really bothering you it may be worth the expense. \n\nSo basically cover all openings where they might get in, remove all food they might want, and spray something to deter or kill the ones that still make it in.",

So when it's time to eat, you either have to heat it up (which takes forever), or settle for chunks of congealed oil which then melt in the food resulting in far too much oil.\n\nThe solution: Giardiniera is safe to store in the pantry as long as you keep the oil level above the vegetables. And if you happen to drop below, just top it off with some new oil.\n\nDouble-bonus: When the veggies are gone, you have some delicious, infused olive oil to use in other applications. \n\nThis message is brought to you by science.",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Triple O's burgers leave nothing to be desired for me. I would like to replicate them at home.\n\nI, embarrassingly enough, have scoured multiple reddit threads on this subject. Most of the answers suggest Triple O Sauce is simply mayo and red hamburger relish. I've tried Strubs Hamburger Relish from IGA.. it's really close, close enough for me. However.. it is not confirmed.\n\nThe mayo! The mayo does not taste like Hellman's or Miracle Whip (bleh). It's thicker, it has a more neutral taste. Based on my gluttonous research it turns out many restaurants use \"heavy duty mayo\" which is different than what grocery stores sell. It holds firmer for a longer period of time and does not melt quite as easily. Convenient for restaurants when used as a dipping sauce or sitting under a heat lamp for extended periods of time.\n\nIt appears, based on some commenters on previous threads, that the mayo is delivered from Sysco. Some suspect there is **paprika** in the sauce, providing a slight pink/orange colour. Could it be Sysco Classic Banquet Extra Heavy Duty Mayonnaise? There is paprika in the ingredients list. Or perhaps Triple O's has a custom sauce they have delivered through Sysco distributors.\n\n[https://www.instacart.com/products/19277139-sysco-mayonnaise-banquet-extra-heavy-duty-1-gl](https://www.instacart.com/products/19277139-sysco-mayonnaise-banquet-extra-heavy-duty-1-gl)\n\n## Ingredients\n\nSoybean Oil, Water, Egg Yolks, Distilled White Vinegar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Contains Less than 2% of Salt, Mustard Flour, Natural Flavor, Calcium Disodium EDTA (to Preserve Flavor), **Paprika**, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder.\n\nInformants, traitors, enemies of Nat Bailey - flock to this thread and reveal your secrets!",

This tangy and creamy sauce is perfect for burgers and other dishes. Here's a recipe inspired by the flavors of Triple-O's sauce:\n\nIngredients:\n\n-    1 cup mayonnaise\n-    1/4 cup ketchup\n-    2 tablespoons relish (preferably dill pickle relish)\n-    1 tablespoon white vinegar\n-    1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n-    1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n-    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n-    Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.    In a medium-sized bowl, combine the mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, white vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and garlic powder.\n2.    Stir the ingredients together until well combined. Make sure the sauce is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed.\n3.    Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper according to your preference. Add a little at a time, tasting as you go, until you achieve the desired flavor.\n4.    Once seasoned, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the sauce to a sealed container. Refrigerate the sauce for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. This step is important for achieving the best taste.\n5.    After chilling, give the sauce a final stir before serving. It's now ready to be enjoyed!\n\nYou can use Triple-O's sauce as a condiment for burgers, sandwiches, fries, or even as a dip for chicken nuggets. Feel free to adjust the ingredient quantities to suit your taste preferences. Enjoy your homemade Triple-O's sauce!",

    "body": "Hello! Static here, posting for /u/NickofNight :) He wrote this story, though, so all credit and applause to him <3 \n\n***\n\nEriksen sniffed the bowl twice before scrunching his nose up. \"Shit don't smell like dodo.\"\n\nThe prison officer frowned. \"You know what cooked dodo smells like, Erik?\"\n\nThe man considered. \"Not like stale beans, I don't reckon. And probably didn't look some guy had stomped his boots into said beans.\"\n\nIt was Eriksen's last meal before the needle. He was chained to a table inside his cell, his arms given only enough slack for him to pick up his spoon. Wasn't allowed to eat with nothing but a spoon. Hadn't been for years. And if he touched this one, if he started eating with it, it'd be the last spoon he'd ever touch. That made him wonder about the *first* spoon he'd touched. His mom shovelling something into his mouth that didn't look too different to this meal, probably. Him refusing to eat that, too. Funny that he didn't remember his mom, not even what she looked like, but his heart still ached for her.\n\n\"Not only is it a fine cut of the very last dodo in the world, Erik,\" said Office Lou Corbett, standing against the wall, hands in pockets, \"fried in soybean oil -- per your request, but Chef tells me it's also the tastiest damn meal he's ever made, period.\"\n\n\"I think I'd rather have the chair,\" Erik said. He looked over his shoulder at a single piece of wood lying on a shelf. It'd been carved into a boat that'd never sail water. Not a good carving, by anyone's measure -- barely even looked like a boat. But it had been the first thing he'd made in woodworking class, and it still meant the most.\n\n\"You can't eat a chair, Erik.\"\n\n\"Nah. I mean I'd rather it killed me than poison did. Seems a better ending. Sitting in a throne like a king, struck by a bolt of thunder, muscles tight as you're taken to the next world. Seems more honorable, you know?\"\n\n\"There won't be any pain this way, Erik.\"\n\n\"What'd you know about pain, Lou? You're too lucky for real pain.\"\n\n\"I know some stuff about it.\"\n\n\"You go home to your little boy and your blue-eyed wife each night, and you forget all about the shit you've seen and heard here. You live an easy life, Lou. I hope you treasure it.\"\n\nLou laughed. \"You think I can go home, strip out of these clothes and forget about everything here? I'd have to strip off my fucking skin to do that, Erik.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Jesus, Erik. I'll go home tonight and I won't be able to look at my son or my wife -- not in the eyes, at least. Because I'll be thinking about the ghost that's waiting for me when I get to work tomorrow. Your empty fucking cell. Empty bed. Those fucking wooden carvings that won't be here any longer, that always make me feel like I've walked out of the prison and into some little shop.\"\n\nThey were quiet for a time, the heat and steam from the bowl stolen away by the cold room.\n\n\"Into a shop?\" said Erik.\n\n\"That's how it feels to me. The kind of shop my wife'd like.\"\n\nErik nodded and smiled just a little.\n\n\"I am lucky,\" said Lou. \"You're right about that.\"\n\nErik just sighed. \"Eight god-damned years, and I'm still not ready to go.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"You've never once asked if I did it.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Lou repeated.\n\n\"Why? Must be curious?\"\n\nLou shrugged. \"Maybe I don't believe you're the same guy you were before you came in here -- so whether you did it or not, it doesn't matter as much to me as it does to some others.\"\n\n\"How could anyone be the same, right?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"For one thing, I couldn't whittle shit before I got in here. Learned some useful skills to take into the next life. Hope God still likes carpenters, 'cause I might finally get employment.\" He laughed, paused, then added, \"And if I'm not headed for up there, well, I reckon the downstairs place can't be so bad as here.\"\n\nLou was silent for a moment. \"I'll make sure your carvings get to your kid.\"\n\n\"That's good of you Lou, but I don't think he'll want them. Maybe as firewood, but probably not at all.\"\n\n\"Maybe. Maybe not. But I'll give them to him and he can choose.\"\n\nAnother, longer silence. Finally, Erik said, \"If you do see him... if he speaks to you, tell him I made the boat for him. He loved boats when he was little and I told him that one day I'd take him out sailing. And I don't think I can keep that promise, but maybe he could take it to a lake or...\"\n\n\"I'll tell him.\"\n\nErik nodded. \"I'm glad he's not coming to see me go.\"\n\n\"I can understand that, I think. Not wanting him here.\"\n\n\"Look, Lou... I *did* do it. If that helps you sleep. 'Cause you need sleep, Lou. Need to look after that family of yours.\"\n\nLou considered. \"No, I don't think it will help me all that much.\"\n\n\"I didn't want to do it, you know? But it was me or him. That's just how it was.\"\n\n\"You're not that person anymore. It's been, what, twenty years?\"\n\n\"I soon won't be any person anymore.\"\n\nLou looked at the bowl, stared at it hard enough to keep his eyes dry. \"You going to eat that or what? We're running out of time.\"\n\nErik sighed. \"I go tonight no matter what, eh?\"\n\nLou nodded. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Guess life is for living, right? And I suppose I don't much want to leave on an empty stomach. But tell Chef I was pissed he couldn't get me real dodo.\" \n\nLou paused, then after winning a fight with a smile, he said, \"This is real dodo, Erik! You just got to sort of... you know, use your imagination a bit.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah?\" He stared at the cold mushed beans. \"How does dodo taste, then?\"\n\n\"Like a fillet steak, Erik. Cooked just how you like it.\"\n\n\"I like it rare.\"\n\n\"Well there you go, that's just how Chef did it!\"\n\nErik grinned as he took the spoon. \"Well ain't that lucky, Lou?\"\n\nLou's voice cracked just slightly as Erik took his first mouthful of the world's last dodo. \"Ain't it just.\"\n\n***\n\nAs always, thanks for reading our stuff <3 Welcome back if you're a longtime reader, and welcome in if you're stumbling in from WP.

    "body": "Welcome to the Outback Steakhouse team! Below are a list of rules that all employees must follow:\n\n1. Cooks are to remain in the kitchen at all times, and may not enter the dining area. Servers must collect prepared dishes via the kitchen counter and may not enter the kitchen area.\n\n2. We at Outback Steakhouse take pride in our signature dish - the Blooming Onion. This is the only dish that may use dog lard. All other fried recipes must use soybean oil.\n\n3. Servers must inspect the food upon receiving it from the cook. Anything that is still moving in the food must be removed from the dish, placed into the bucket of saline water on the kitchen counter, and returned to the cook.\n\n4. USDA regulations require all steak to be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees, which is a medium steak, regardless of what kind of steak the customer orders. If the customer wants a rare steak, inject 10 mililiters of cattle myoglobin and blood into the thickest part of the steak after cooking to give it a red appearance. If the customer wants a medium-rare steak, inject only 5 mililiters.\n\n5. We do not serve turkey bacon. However, if a customer requests turkey bacon as a substitute for regular bacon, there is a refrigerated jar of meat on the bottom shelf that the cook must use.\n\n6. Our cajun and chili seasonings contain ground millipede. If a customer finds millipede legs in their dish, the server must inform them that it is just black pepper.\n\n6. Inside the walk-in cooler is a room that may only be accessed by the manager on duty.\n\n7. Each shift will have at least two employees dressed as customers who sit near the televisions at the bar and watch the ball game shown. If any customer shows signs of food poisoning, these employees are required to cheer at the ball game loud enough to cause a distraction while the manager on duty escorts the sick customer to the room inside the walk-in cooler.\n\n8. The lights in the restaurant will automatically turn out at 11:52PM every night. By 11:48, the manager must lock the room inside the walk-in cooler, and all employees must leave the restaurant by then.\n\n9. Every day before exiting the building, all employees must discard their name tag, so that they can be assigned a new name for the next day.",

Salted sardines with Lucky Charms. This is one of my favorite late night meals or midnight snacks when I have milk, Lucky Charms, and sardines on hand. First photo is the meal as a whole. Can't post a second photo for some reason, but it features a perfect bite: milk, salted sardines, the oats of the Lucky Charms, and the marshmallow of the Lucky Charms.\n\nCommon Q&A:\n1. What about the bones?\n    The bones add to it. I like the texture.\n2. What type of sardines?\n   I prefer ones in soybean oil.\n3. Do you really add extra salt to them?\n   Yes.\n4. Are they too salty?\n   No.\n5. Is everything ok at home?\n   Why do you ask.\n6. Are you aware that you are committing a crime against humanity?\n   I never claimed to be innocent.\n7. Do you actually like it?\n   Of course.\n8. Do you also like pineapple pizza?\n   It's sweet and salty, so yes.\n9. What is the best cereal for this?\n   Lucky Charms is #1 imo, with Fruit Loops coming as a close second. The blue Fruit Loops are the tastiest ones, so if you get a scoop with all blue Fruit Loops with your sardines, you will be sure to enjoy it. The sweeter the cereal, the better.\n\nHappy to address any comments and concerns!",

This post will sum up with I found.\n\nSo, because this is going to be another wall of text:\n\n**TL, DR:**\n\n**- Flaxseed flaking could be caused by one of these two factors or a combination of the two:**\n\n**1) The application of flax oil on a hot surface, around 100°C, do not allow the complete** [**wetting**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetting) **of the surface due to the much higher reactivity of the flaxseed oil compared to the other oils (indirect evidences, mostly from the complete absence of an heating step on 4 different patents).**\n\n**2) Excessive tension build up in the cured polymer that causes detachment from the surface, again, due to the higher reactivity of the oil compared to the others (this is actually reported in the literature).**\n\n**- The idea of a \"right\" flaxseed oil could actually be correct but has nothing to do with it being \"organic\" or refrigerated but simply due to its high variability in its composition.**\n\n**- It's possible to finely grind the iron oxide to better disperse it in the oil.**\n\n**- It appears to be possible to produce thich flaxseed films with a very, very smooth surface.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd like to start this post with a recap on the caratheristic of the oils, the fatty acids that compose them and the seasoning/polymerization process itself because I keep reading a lot of opinions without any sources to back them up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**- The oils/fats compositon, chemical reactions, metal driers, role of the temperature, smoke point.**\n\nWhat are vegetable and animal fats composed of? Mostly triglycerides, which are made by a molecule of [glycerol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol) united with 3 [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid). There can be also molecule of diglycerides and monoglycerides, where the number of fatty acids is only two or one. The oils usually also present free fatty acids, unbound to any glyerol molecule, vitamins and antioxydant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/wf80aqm6tm6a1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn most cases, the majority of the fatty acids present in an oil/fat, both as free fatty acid and bound in a trygliceride, is made of by oleic(18:1), linoleic(18:2) and linolenic acid(18:3). The (18:1) means that the molecule \"tail\" is made of 18 carbon atoms and present a single unsaturated molecular bond, or \"double\" bond. I'll use it through the post as is easy to confouse linoleic and linoleNic aicds.\n\nAn exception of this is the [tung oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_oil), which is mostly composed of [eleostearic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Eleostearic_acid), a (20:3) fatty acid.\n\nThe wiki page on [vegetable oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil) has a list of various oils and their compositions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bsgcnjw7rm6a1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d36b64288bdeb6518df4f1dc2e72ace8fd26ed5\n\nThe polymerization of an oil/fat is due to the presence of these double bonds in its \"tail\", as those can \"open up\" and reacty with their neighboring molecules, creating a network of chemical bonds that links all the glycerides molecules together.\n\nThis usually follows two main routes:\n\n1. Oxidative: in presence of oxygen, peroxides are formed, which then decompose into radical that then start the polymerization process. The wikipedia page on [drying oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying_oil) has a basic figure that shows it.\n\nThis is the reaction that happens during seasoning.\n\n2) [Diels Alder reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diels%E2%80%93Alder_reaction): heating the oils above 270°C causes the double bonds to break down and polymerize but it requires complete absence of oxygen. The resulting oil will be very viscous and will polymerize much faster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe composition of the oils in  terms of fatty acids is crucial regarding the polymerization process due to the fact that:\n\n>[It is known that linoleic acid oxidises from 10 to 40 times faster than  oleic acid, whereas α-linolenic acid oxidises 2–4 times faster than  linoleic acid](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/20/10355)\n\nSo an oil with an high content of triple unsaturated fatty acids will be much more reactive than one mostly composed by monounsaturated fatty acids. Flaxseed and tung oils are an example of the former. These oil have the characteristic to undergo oxidative polymerization even at ambient temperature and thus are defined as \"drying\" oils.\n\nSome **metallic compounds**, [usually made with cobalt, manganese, zinc but also iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drying_agent), accelerates substantially the reaction as their presence lower considerably the energy required to break down peroxides into radicals to start the polymerization. There are primary, secondary and thertiary driers, just to let you know that there is a little world of knowledge even for these.\n\nWe can assume with a good margin of safety that the surface of a cast iron cockware is catalytic toward the oils polymerization.\n\nThe **temperature** of the oil influence greatly the speed at which the polymerization proceeds due to the fact that chemical reactions [tend to increase by a factor of 2 every 10°C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation). So at 240°C the reaction will have a theorical speed around 1000 times (2\\^10) faster than if done at 140°C.\n\nThe **smoke point** of an oil is very often cited regarding seasoning, often because temperature should be above it to get a good seasoning, sometimes not, but it has no actual meaning; instead, if you check again the table regarding [the properties of vegetable oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil) on the wiki you'll notice that the vast majority of them are around 200°C, which is a temperature more than appropriate to have a polymerization in a brief time. The exception if flaxseed that has a smoke point of 107°C: good luck if you try to get the oil polymerized at that temperature in 2h. Yet the flaxseed, as I'll show later, can polymerize very well at that temperature or even less, but at a much longer times.\n\nA note  to conclude: I see sometimes people claiming that the seasoning process is \"understood\" or similar phrases. This is incorrect, to my surprise TBH, and there is still quite some research being done on the polymerization/oxidation reactions of vegetable oil, [flax in particular](https://firesciencereviews.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2193-0414-1-3).\n\nUnfortunately this is mostly to produce bio based polymers, not coatings, but some works still investigates the fine nuances of the process itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FLAXSEED&FLAKING, FIRST HYPOTHESIS: ADHESION AND TEMPERATURE**\n\n**Note**: seasoning from the point of view of adhesion theory appear to be and edge case as it involves pouring a coating on a surface that is catalytical towards the polymerization reaction and relatively hot, as most protocols usually instructs to dry the pan in the oven and then immediately apply the oil. I couldn't find a proper equivalent in the literature. I noticed that application of coating on hot surface is a specialized niche.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue with flaxseed is not with polymerization but rather with adhesion to the cast iron: the oil polymerize very well but then detaches itself from the surface, cracking and flaking.\n\nHaving tested polymerization even with iron oxide and still experiencing flaking, I decided to divert (initially) my attention to the characteristic of the oil itself: I found [this thesis by](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:7720/FULLTEXT01.pdf) miss Cecilia Stenberg that proved a very good source material as the topic was comparing the drying of a flaxseed oil containing a high amount of linolenic(18:3) acid, 60.4%,  and one with a very low amount of it, 2.7%, but compensating with a very high amount of linoleic(18:2) acid, >70%.\n\nScope of the thesis was investigating the oil properties in regards their use as a coating for wood.\n\nThe polymerization of the oils were investigated with [chemoluminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence), as:\n\n>Free radical oxidation of polymers and organic compounds leads to emission of low levelsof visible light, photons, which is commonly termed as chemiluminescence (CL) \\[33\\]. CL-measurements can be used to follow oxidation reactions in real-time with high sensitivity.\n\nShe used a cobalt drier, usually rated as the best around (but toxic, same for lead), at concentration of 0.01% metal in oil. Quite a different compared to pour oil on a litteral slab or iron if you think about it!\n\nAs expected, the oils behave differently between them and in respect to the temperature and addition of driers:\n\n[CL signal: chemoluminescence photons collected per minute.](https://preview.redd.it/72hir2es5n6a1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=affbafceb3240b3fd44bcaef97a158ad7ed5b902)\n\nHigh content of linolenic(18:3) acid causes a faster reaction at 70°C. Notice the absence of an induction period, the flat line at the beginning, for oil A.\n\nRegarding tempearture and driers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/54ywh2km6n6a1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cbf01b5b9aafb3d009e194b2953040ac2354a28\n\nWe can see that a 30°C, almost room temperature, and absence of driers, the oxidation is very slow and basically a flatline on the graph. At 70°C we can see a very fast initial reaction with a drier added compared to a slow ramp up without it. A 100°C things get interesting as the reaction is much faster than 70°C and even more than 30°C but the addition of the drier causes it to peak way before than the sample without drier. This is explained due to the formation of a \"skin\" on the surface of the oil, which block oxygen penetration:\n\n>For oil B (C18:3) the addition of a drier increases the initial drying rate significantlyminimising the induction time of the auto-oxidation. RTIR measurements show a fasterdecrease of unconjugated cis-unsaturations (at 3010 cm-1), at higher temperatures, but italso results in higher levels of residual unconjugated cis-unsaturations (Figure 10).This suggests that the reaction becomes diffusion dependent at a certain stage i.e. a skin isformed with a dense network at the top limiting the diffusion of oxygen to the bottom ofthe film. In the RTIR results for oil B it is seen that the lowest temperature (30 °C) result inthe lowest amount of residual unsaturations in the bottom layer. When the temperature isincreased to 70 °C, it results in a higher initial oxidation rate due to the presence of the topdrier (the cobalt salt) mainly active in the surface layer of the drying film but also a moreabrupt stop of the oxidation. This is probably related to the formation of a “skin” with a Tgin the range of this temperature. Increasing the temperature further to 100 °C also results inan abrupt stop but at lower level of residual unsaturations. This lower level may be due tothe fact that a temperature high enough makes the film softer which reduces the barrierfunction of the “skin”\n\nOverall those data show very well both the effects of temperature, the driers and the oil composition.\n\nThe thesis was not exceptionally technical on the adhesion theory but this passage got my attention:\n\n>Properties of the coating material are also important, **such as the viscosity of the coating material** affecting the penetration into the wood as well as the polarity, **the chemical reactivity between** **~~wood~~** ***what about cast iron?*** **and the coating** and the thickness of the coating. All these variables have an influence on the final result\n\nI made here the assumption that if the surface catalyze the polymerization, this could have an effect on the adhesion of the polymer, so I switched my attention towards adhesion theory papers.\n\n[Unholy things like this one](https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-319-55411-2), for example.\n\nTo make it brief: temperature has definetely an influence in the strength of the bonding between surface and the coating, but not as much as the omnipresent sourface roughnes. There are many other parameters.\n\nWhat I suspect could happens is this: as the oil is applied on a \"hot\" surface, the polymerization immediately begin and causes a localized increase in viscosity at the oil-iron interface, impeding a complete \"wetting\" of the surface at a microscopic level and thus a lesser strenght in the bond between the polymer and the surface. A \"Cassie-Baxter\" state in technical terms (if I understood them right!):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgtigf8abn6a1.png?width=401&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d26c906025bbab2977ea75e32c97e7806aaf6da\n\nI started then to searching for papers on a topic similar to the seasoning but to no avail.\n\nIndirect evidence of this issue can be deduced by the presence on every paint products of a maximum application temperature, above which various deleterious effects can present, cracking and detachment of the paint included. As I wrote above, cast iron seasoning is probably an edge case as it combines high temperature and catalytic activity towards the coating.\n\nThe best evidence, still indirect, of the application of oil on an hot pan came from 4 patents, all of them missing any reference to an heating of the pan, 3 of them recommending flaxseed:\n\n>[Now returning back to the surface treatment method of an iron-cast product according to the present embodiment, a mold-cast item having been heated and subjected to the oxide coat forming treatment is cooled naturally to the normal temperature next (S102), and vegetable oil is applied to the whole surface of the mold-cast item having an oxide coat formed thereon (S103). As the vegetable oil, for example, linseed oil, olive oil, canola oil and grape seed oil, etc. may be used and, among those, use of linseed oil is particularly preferable.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20150238047A1)\n\nThis actually instructs to cool \"naturally\" the pan.\n\n>[According to the present invention, the metal surface to be coated is'first rigorously cleaned, i. e., freed from oil, grease, dirt, and scale, and is also roughened or etched to at least a small degree. The cleaning and roughening may be accomplished by mechanical means such as sandblast or by chemicaletching agents. The clean, roughened surface is then coated with a heat polymerizable organic material, and is heated to a temperature in excess of about 350 F. and no higher than about 680 F. to convert the material to a tough, flexible, non-tacky polymer.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2809901)\n\nThis one is from 1952. Sheryl Canter is definetely not the first one to recommend flaxseed.\n\n>[1) casting iron pan is polished and cleaned, the method for polishing cleaning is first ball blast, then is washed, and is then dried, finally in its table Face coating vegetable oil (peanut oil), the thickness of cast iron cooker surface coating vegetable oil is 7 μm；](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN105463169B/en)  \n>  \n>2) cast iron cooker for being coated with vegetable oil is heat-treated；  \n>  \n>Wherein, the heat treatment includes the pre-heat treatment, high-temperature baking processing and cooling processing；The pre-heat treatment include from Room temperature is to 300 DEG C, and the programming rate of the pre-heat treatment is 0.45 DEG C/s\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>[3.

It's not a bad idea overall but probably it can causes issues with flaxseed oil due to its higher reactivity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FLAXSEED&FLAKING, SECOND HYPOTHESIS: EXCESSIVE POLYMERIZATION LEADING TO EXCESSIVE TENSION AND THUS BREAKAGE OF THE COATING.**\n\nIf you check my previous post photos you'll notice that the sample polymerized with iron oxide present a lot of wrinkles on the surface and we don't want that at all!\n\nWrinkles formation is apparently caused  by tension build up in the polymer, due to unreacted oil diffusing into the polymer network, surpassing a critical treshold:\n\n>[It is hypothesized that during cure compressive elastic stress  developed in the skin when unreacted low-molecular weight oligomer below  the skin diffuses up into the oligomer-depleted cross-linking skin and  tends to swell it.

(this is a classical example of not knowing the research topic, diggin through a lot of shit and then find the golden nugget that open you a world of references)\n\n>[It is well known that linseed oil-based coatings are prone to  crocodiling (surface crack formation), it is suggested that the severity  of this phenomenon may be related to the volumetric reduction of the  binder during curing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02765585).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Nevertheless, when oils are used as  \n>  \n>binders in coatings, it is reasonable to  \n>  \n>assume that there is a relation between  \n>  \n>the volume shrinkage of the oil and the  \n>  \n>tendency of the coating towards croco  \n>  \n>diling (re surface crack formation).

What they said can be summarized as following:\n\n\\- First paper was again on wrinkling formation, investigating the effect of normal, boiled (partial polymerization through oxydation) or stand flaxseed oil (partial polymerization through Diels Alder reaction). They found that the more viscous and polymerized of the oils, the stand oil, didn't almost present wrinkling on the surface.\n\n\\- The second paper was on the polymerization of flaxseed oil and mentioned briefly the wrinkling problem, giving as a solution its dilution with a 15% of [soybean oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean_oil), which is rich in linoleic(18:2) acid but poor in linolenic(18:3) acid. This was in accordance with [the  other paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02765585) I linked a few paragraph above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo conclude this part, it appears that tension formation is indeed an issue that could cause flaking and is reported in the literature. This could explain the issue with flaxseed flaking weeks or even months after seasoning and its infamous status as the curing process of the flaxseed is LONG, years at room temperature.\n\nAs a bonus I'd like to post a picture of my last seasoning, with thick coating and iron oxide, which present most of the flaking where, I suppose, tension would cause the highest stress: near the curvature of the cooking surface.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 basal coating in pure flaxseed, 6 \\\\\"thick\\\\\" with iron oxide. At least is somewhat glossy!](https://preview.redd.it/03rdyftqkn6a1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b004f7601feebb6d76dffd8721ff85dc341c44e)\n\nRest of the photo album here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/Gzfinnh](https://imgur.com/gallery/Gzfinnh) (these are at 4 thich layers!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THAT \"MAGIC\" FLAXSEED OIL: THE VARIABILITY IN ALPHA-LINOLENIC(18:3) ACID.**\n\nI think everyone here has read *ad nauseam* about the flaxseed... not in a very productive way, citing things like \"luck\", \"organic\", \"non refined\" and \"refrigeration\", \"NEVER USE IT!111!, etc... With the information from above I immediately hopped on the hypothesis that the idea of a \"right\" flaxseed oil could be explained by its content of linolenic(18:3) acid: too much and you get flaking as the tension in the polymer became excessive.\n\nSo, how much linolenic(18:3) acid do we have in our flaxseed?\n\n\\- [The wikipedia page gives a 56%-71% range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linseed_oil).\n\n\\- Cecilia Stanberg's thesis gives 3 oils at 2.7%, 60.4% and 55.2%.\n\n\\- [39.9% to 60.4%](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Major-fatty-acids-profile-in-flaxseed-oil_tbl1_265393410).\n\n\\- [44%, 39.9%, 36.6%, 50.5%, 53.2%, 47.0%](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fatty-acids-composition-in-fresh-flaxseed-oils_tbl2_290473235).\n\nAs a scientist I can tell you that with this variablity you can kiss goodbay to any reproducibility.\n\nJust for add more salt on the injury, the EU plant cultivars database list something like [171 different registered species of flaxseed](https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_propagation_material/plant_variety_catalogues_databases/search/public/index.cfm?event=SearchVariety&ctl_type=A&species_id=245&variety_name=&listed_in=0&show_current=on&show_deleted=).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo conclude this brief section: we have a issue here as it appears that it's entirely probable that 2 person buying flaxseed in a different coutry will probably have some quite different oil at hand. But we have an easy solution: does it flakes? Dilute it with another oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA BETTER OIL + IRON OXIDE COMBO.\n\nIn brief: reducing into fine powder the iron oxide allow to disperse it much better in the oil.\n\nPuttin steel wire, stripped from its protective zinc coating with abrasion or a combo of vinegar + hydrogen peroxide, in a jar with some water and shaking it in the evening and morning allow to get quite some red rust (mostly hydrated [ferric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_oxide)) in a few days.\n\nLetting the same stripped steel wire submerged underwater in a close jar to produce insted black rust (mostly [ferrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(II)_oxide)) is much slower and I didnt' notice any difference in their capability to induce polymerization of thick layers of oil.\n\nI grinded the oxide with an improvised [ball milling](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulino_a_biglie) method: I put the oxide in a jar with a flat bottom with some little coins and orbiatlly shaked it until everything appeared as a powder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1: wet rust. 2: dried rust by evaporation at room temperature. 3 scraped rust dried at 150°C for 1h. 4: finally calcinated at 240°C for 1h to dry it completely AND I SWEAR OFFICER, IT'S NOT WHAT IT SEEMS!](https://preview.redd.it/4jrrzqdfpn6a1.jpg?width=7952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38e5d4ee1a51b1a9eba3433a23c71e79ac1f4c67)\n\nThe dispersion in oil:\n\n[1: pure flaxseed. 2: added the iron oxide and shaked throughly. 3: depostion of the larger particles after 1h.](https://preview.redd.it/is2kybj3rn6a1.jpg?width=5296&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afae9237726e8cd33491605bc81bd4fef533fe85)\n\nWith this method the oil stays \"red\" up to 24h in fridge, while in my previous tests the iron oxides precipitated completely in a few hours.\n\nThe metal driers usually cited in the literature are unfortunately from medium to complex molecules that can't be made with household chemicals. One exception is [iron acetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_acetate), which I found a couple of times in papers, as it's possibly a weak one, but is instead cited quite a lot in [hobbist forum and youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=iron+acetate+ebonization) for the production of a solution to [ebonize wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonising).\n\nI plan to try it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A VERY PROMISING SPECIMEN.**\n\nI'd like to close this long post with the result of a test that was significantly better than the rest. This was produced polymerizing iron oxide doped flaxseed inside a little crucible made folding aluminium paper. In the photos I have to hold it like that as it tends to roll itself up.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have any photo of the original, which I peeled off to check the under layer, but I conserved this one as it was so strikingly better than the rest. I suspect that the cause could be a difference in the content of iron oxide and the fact that, as I wrote in the updates, I was operating not at the fullest temperature of my oven due to the knob in a wrong position :|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Upper, smooth face](https://preview.redd.it/tnw9snlpsn6a1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0ae811218ca359c473300d4a7d43079e87a0f44)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lower, rough face.](https://preview.redd.it/n5cmfz2rsn6a1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=903391d1b1e4a2ff4fd7de885455639e40dda8a7)\n\nThe first thing that you can notice is how big it is: flaking usually consist in tiny particles in the low millimeters size, this one instead is a big as my thumbnail and I can hold it without breaking it, while the flaked seasoning, to my experience, crumbles into dust at the barest touch.\n\nThe bottom surface  was in contact with gelled polymer and is very rough to the touch, and while is quite glossy, it doesn't reflect any image clearly at all.\n\nThe upper surface instead is SMOOTH. I can't share the sensation as I do with a photo so you'll have to belive me: it's anything like I have touched before, not even finely sanded cast iron surface, it really feel like a super smooth plastic. Unfortunately, as it tends to roll itself up, I couldn't make any decent photo but reflectivity and gloss are fantastic.\n\nI hope I'll be able to produce, in the end, something akin to this single specimen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TODO LIST:**\n\n\\- Aluminum cupcakes instead of folded aluminium paper for testing: same surface, very smooth. If one knows the surface area then the volume of oil poured in can be calculared to determinate the final thickness of the polymerized oil.\n\n\\- Iron acetate instad of simple iron oxide.\n\n\\- Dilution of flaxseed with soybean or another low linolenic(18:3) acid AND/OR follow the blown oil route and pre polymerize the oil to reduce tension formation in the final coating.\n\nEdit: - Try to polymerize the oil at lower temperature (<200°C) for a much longer period of time (>6h) to check the effects on wrinkles formation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you had found this interesting. I'll go home for the holydays and start to work again on this pet project in January.\n\nCheers!",

        "body": "This is a fascinating post. This provokes a lot of thought on my part.\n\nOver at r/carbonsteel I wrote this post, and I wonder if some kind of shortcut can be done in light of what you found:\n\n# [Fascinating discovery: a method for turning red rust into black oxide (bluing). Anyone want to try this on a pan?](https://www.reddit.com/r/carbonsteel/comments/o441z4/fascinating_discovery_a_method_for_turning_red/)\n\nThe TL;DR is this: rust bluing involves covering steel in a thin coat of red rust (usually done by a mixture of hydrogen peroxide, salt, and vinegar) and then boiling the rusty part. Boiling or steaming appears to give just enough thermal expansion in the lattice of the iron for Fe2O3 (red rust), whose lattice is stressed because one of the oxygen atoms is in a stressed position, to relax into Fe3O4 (black oxide). The finishing touch is usually to heat the part up past the smoke point of oil and quench it in oil, followed by wiping it down, or simply oilng it without the addition of heat.\n\nIf red rust is the kind of iron oxide that helps the seasoning bond, would it work to short-cut the rust bluing process by simply seasoning a red-rusted piece of cast iron or carbon steel using flax seed oil? Would the red rust give up some of its oxygen while the application of heat also permit the oxygen to migrate out of the stressed position to turn the rust into black oxide?\n\nIf you are interested in expanding your side project into investigating this, I would love to hear what you find.",

In fact, it contains healthy amounts of omega 3, which is an anti-inflammatory.\n\nAs well, canola oil has the least amount of saturated fats among the common cooking oils.\n\n“From a nutritional point of view, it’s an ideal oil, it really is superior,” said Weaver.\n\nShe shudders at the suggestion of anti-seed oil influencers that people should instead be consuming palm and coconut oil.\n\n“They’re very high in saturated fat,” said Weaver.\n\n“You can see that when you see them on the shelf. They’re solid. They’re hard at room temperature. Those are the fats that we want to avoid.”\n\nWood said there is no evidence to suggest that the anti-seed oil campaign has led to any demand destruction for canola oil.\n\nBut the canola industry still felt it was necessary to form the Seed Oil Coalition in conjunction with corn and soybean commodity groups to share information and jointly fight what they deem a misinformation campaign.\n\nThe canola industry created the canolainfo.org website and associated social media handles to help disseminate “correct information” on canola oil in the United States. [https://www.canolainfo.org/](https://www.canolainfo.org/)\n\nIt also operates an exhibit at the annual Food & Nutrition Conference & Expo, where it hands out the latest scientific information on canola oil to dieticians.\n\n“The information in the programs we put out are really backed by science and credible people,” said Wood.\n\nWeaver said the three provincial canola organizations are funding a Canadian marketing campaign called Hello Canola to help spread a positive message about the crop.\n\nThe group is working with social media influencers, such as Abbey Sharp, a dietician who touts the health benefits of canola oil and refutes anti-seed oil claims.\n\nThe target audience for the Hello Canola campaign is English-speaking millennials age 27 to 43 who access the majority of their content digitally.\n\nWood said the canola sector is also preparing a manuscript that will be published in a peer-reviewed journal that will be distributed to dieticians and health professionals to ensure they’re being informed about the health benefits of seed oils such as canola.\n\nThe council is conducting consumer market research to make sure it understands the perceptions and use of canola oil. The results are expected to be ready for publication in about six months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://m.farms.com/news/opinion-healthy-canola-oil-could-use-further-image-boost-209234.aspx](https://m.farms.com/news/opinion-healthy-canola-oil-could-use-further-image-boost-209234.aspx)\n\nAt the risk of preaching to the choir, note this: canola oil is a nutritious food ingredient, far preferable to many other options on the market.\n\nIt has just seven per cent saturated fat, the least among common cooking oils, and has the most plant-based omega-3 fat levels. It is a source of omega-6 fat and has high levels of oleic acid. As well, it does not contain trans fats.\n\nMost farmers know this, but it is dangerous to assume everyone else does.\n\nSocial media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram are littered with attacks on seed oils, including canola oil.\n\nA large number of people who post on these platforms encourage their followers to use alternatives such as palm oil and coconut oil. Yet coconut oil has 87 per cent saturated fat, more than 10 times that of canola oil.\n\nThe danger is that younger consumers develop much of their worldview from social media, and losing their loyalty would be a significant blow to the canola sector.\n\nHowever, the problem goes even deeper.\n\nA recent news article in a U.S. publication rated different cooking oils, giving high marks to olive, sesame and avocado oil and failing grades to corn and soybean oil. Particularly alarming was canola oil’s absence from the story.\n\nGranted, the magazine is American-based, where corn and soybeans are more common than canola, but it shows how far off the radar canola oil can be for many consumers.\n\nThe industry is pushing back against this knowledge gap.\n\nIt has formed the Seed Oil Coalition in conjunction with corn and soybean commodity groups to share information and jointly fight what it deems to be a misinformation campaign.\n\nIt has also created the canolainfo.org website and associated social media handles to disseminate correct information on canola oil in the U.S.\n\nAn exhibit at the annual Food & Nutrition Conference & Expo provides the latest scientific information on canola oil to dietitians.\n\nThe three provincial canola organizations are funding a Canadian marketing campaign called Hello Canola to help spread a positive message about the crop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/361cst03uptc1.png?width=3484&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffd19813bc858a5a00a5e341d921621369d16617\n\n[https://hellocanola.ca/benefits/health-wellness/](https://hellocanola.ca/benefits/health-wellness/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ud1k9nx9uptc1.png?width=1748&format=png&auto=webp&s=edaf5e6b7ce15538e567f6a0779b0e5d18c82027\n\nThese are outstanding initiatives, but more must be done. Tearing a page from dairy’s playbook would be a good place to start.\n\nWhile many other parts of the agricultural landscape wait for a crisis and then go on the defensive, dairy producers take a more proactive approach to promoting the health benefits of their products.\n\nMilk has taken control of the narrative, and anti-animal agriculture activists find it a tough castle to storm.\n\nCanola groups should begin working to do the same.\n\nGrowers must also recognize that we are now in the era of the social media influencer. These celebrities, who often have no expertise in the areas on which they expound, have massive followings and the ability to dramatically change public opinion.",

    "body": "(Posted earlier on [r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/))\n\nHey Traders!\n\nThe question pretty much sums it all. I am a semi-professional futures trader (CL, ZT, ZS, some crypto), who uses basic technical indicators since two years and has been fairly profitable.\n\nThat said, I don't understand the rush towards all things maths and statistics as a basic requirement to trade - if hedge fund and prop trading positions are considered.\n\nSo here's my humble question - where exactly does complex math, statistical model making, and computer programming come into the picture? Software dev positions are explanatory, but where do the aforementioned help? Doesn't the first rule of markets say you can't predict prices and movements?\n\nOr is everyone rushing towards complex solutions which could have been solved fairly easily?\n\nWorse still - are talks of ML, RL, AI, algo, etc a \"gimmick\" to attract investor capital?\n\nAll thoughts would be very, very helpful.\n\nPS - Don't make this a discussion about TA vs Quant. I do use indicators to trade, but definitely, don't draw discretionary trend lines or watch \"heads and shoulders\" or analyze moon phases to place trades. In fact, I do think TA is complete bull, but using indicators has its logical reasons.\n\n**Edit 1** \\- Terrific answers, y'all. I am sure many others would be pleased over these insights.\n\n**Edit 2** \\- Here's an outline about how I trade. Mentioned it in one of the comments below but I guess it makes a good add-on to the passage:\n\nAs an economics graduate, I understand the most widely used macro-economic models and can construct most models used by mutual funds or I-banks. However, the use of \"complex\" math and Ph.D. degrees as a prerequisite to trade profitably goes right above me.\n\nFor example - while trading the soybean oil futures (ZL) market, I look at any directly affecting news variables or major import/export law changes or drastic macro climate changes that would impact ZL prices. I then form a hypothesis of which side (long/short) to take *more* exposure in, check basic moving averages, check soybean futures (they kinda *lead oil* prices indicator-wise) and depending on my screen availability, either trade aggressively or place a couple of contracts and walk away. Each contract costs me $490, each hundredth of a tick movement is worth $6, so a brief move nets me $300-$500 if I trade 6-7 contracts. Some days the market goes crazy and it equates to over a thousand dollars in profits, and it almost never does crazy reversals that I end up taking on a huge loss. For futures like NQ that are absolute beasts in terms of volatility and movement, a few contracts can easily net a few grand if the market goes ballistic (trump tweets, trade war updates, etc).\n\nI guess my point is, this basic idea of how I trade gives me respectable profits - leaving me pondering for the need for a math or physics Ph.D. to trade markets profitably. However, generally knowing what they do greatly helps me appreciate the quant trading sector, and leaves a good impression of how I must not get comfortable with my strategy and look towards including more advanced concepts to ensure I don't end up crying my way to the morgue.",

In a very(very) general sense you're both doing the same thing.  But to give you an idea of how different it is let's take this analogy:\n\nYou're an okay hunter, you've got a few hundred acres leased and you're not a bad shot.  Finding deer seems random to most but you understand that they get a lil horny in early January.  There's this basin in your lease with some nice fertile ground with good feed, water nearby, and a place to bed down so there's usually deer the last few weeks of the year.  You've recognized a pattern.  You go out three mornings a week during that period and hopefully bag you a nice buck. \n\nQuants have a statistical model that takes weather variation, lunar cycles, average winter temps, fluctuations in deer population, shifts in rut activity over time, average sunrise, etc in to account.  Their model tells them that if it's January 13th, at 7:45am and the sun has been cresting at 7:23am, the temperature is 43 degrees, the moon was only 37% visible the night before, the average rut began four days ago, and there's fresh water within 37 feet of a clearing with peat grass in the mid central region of Alabama there's a 62% chance a deer will appear within firing range.  They know if they observe a doe there's a 73.2% chance based on historic assumptions a larger buck will appear within 37 minutes.  They know the left side of the field approximately 203 yards out is the most likely place they'll see said deer at 42% probability.  \n\nYou both recognized a pattern.  You're just figuratively drawing with crayon outside the lines while they've got a high res inkjet.",

If you define a 'quant' as anyone who has some math background then this question is broader than it appears to be. For example, my graduate thesis was on the dynamic hedging of options (option structures) but I feel it too hubristic to describe myself as a quant. \n\nThis requires some math. Stochastic calculus, monte carlo applications, etc. For portfolio optimization and the baynesian progression of risk optimization there is definitely some math involved.\n\nI would actually respond with a more basic notion in that, if asset prices move in a continuous brownian motion, there needs to be some ability to characterize the appropriate purchase levels, given the asset's parameters. \n\nThe ability to discern the 'biased' nature of an asset can certainly be done with some common sense (as you mentioned in your post) but to mathematically map the correct level of this bias, some math is involved.\n\nCertainly, if there is convergence mapping or some other attempt at arbitrage, we will need to do more than break for lunch. (Think combined matrixes, or fungibility-the ability to stack, replicate, synthesize, and diversify/hedge based  upon the convergence and interchangeability of assets)\n\nMath is the 'best' degree because it is the tool which everyone uses.

Gegen Nachmittag/Abend Sprang der Kurs unserer Lieblingsaktie von 161 auf 167 USD. Bei Börsenschluss lag der Kurs mit einem Tagesplus von 5,60 bei knapp 165 USD.Über den Tag wurden 1,3 Mio Aktien gehandelt, was im Vergleich zu Freitag eine Steigerung um 300.000 darstellt.\n\n[Yahoo Finance](https://preview.redd.it/b8c3s02ea6j71.png?width=1575&format=png&auto=webp&s=42c815cc8c95ea32e3a88edb74e1fbed78ddf333)\n\nDer Blick auf die Heatmap lässt uns erkennen, dass die meisten Aktien im grünen Bereich schließen konnten.

Last update was September 21 when there was a huge discrepancy from the close and open price of soybean oil futures.   \n\nAs far as futures go, soybean hit a massive decline in the hours before futures stopped trading Friday.  As a potential leading indicator of a financial crisis, this may be a glimpse into the psychology of major futures traders across the globe.  \n\nThis is a follow up from the below post, which is just me watching a random theory that was presented in mid 2021.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x7ik4u/the_soybean_oil_theory/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nThis group has been instrumental in dealing with all the emotions and questions I had. So I wanted to start off this post by saying thank you 🫶\n\nSome background:\n\nIn January 2022 I began experiencing heavy periods (clots and all). I had never experienced anything like that in my life. It was so bad I eventually became severely anemic (like 0.2 away from a blood transfusion) and established care with a hematologist. At the time I was seeing an hematologist and a doctor from Parsley Health that order a laundry list of test. No one brought up that it could be fibroids. They offered solutions to the symptoms but never seemed to have an answer to the root cause.\n\nFinally after being frustrated, I went back to the OBGYN in January of this year. During the exam, he could feel my fibroid! After the ultrasound, it ended up finding the following:\n\n3.9cm fibroid at the opening of my cervix (removed) \n\nA polyp (removed- which post surgery was identified as a smaller fibroid)\n\nAnd 2 fibroids - one posterior and the other subserosal fundal - these are smaller (under 2 cm) mand were not tackled in my most recent surgery \n\n(We also ended up doing a D&C)\n\nI had a great surgeon who talked me through the whole procedure and happily answered my 40,000 questions I had. In a solopreneur so insurance sucked, and I had to figure out weird nuances to health insurance that no one should have to think about while going through this.\n\nRecovery was not bad. Even though I had a few days where using my core and lifting my legs were impossible (mind you, I had a hysteroscopic myomectomy). \n\nI personally am determined to not have this happen again. And for the smaller ones in a different placement I don’t want those to grow.\n\nNYU has a fibroid center so I took the following steps:\n\nMet with a dietician who focuses on patients with fibroids\n\nScheduled a meeting with a surgeon that can expose me to other options should I remove the smaller ones \n\nScheduled an acupuncture session (I know nothing is conclusive around this, however figured it couldn’t hurt)\n\nHere are some interesting things the dietician shared:\n\nFocus: Hormone Balancing + Anti-Inflammation\n\nFoods to Limit or Avoid:\n\t•\tRed and processed meats (bacon, sausages, salami, bologna) — limit intake\n\t•\tSoy (mimics estrogen): soy milk, tofu, edamame, soy sauce, soybean oil, soy protein isolate\n\t•\tAdded sugar — aim for <7g per item, max 20g/day\n\t•\tArtificial sweeteners/sugar alcohols\n\t•\tExcess caffeine (especially during menstruation) — keep to 8–12oz\n\t•\tOat milk (basically starch water)\n\nBetter Options:\n\t•\tEggs, egg whites, Greek yogurt\n\t•\tWhey protein\n\t•\tOrganic, hormone-free chicken and dairy\n\t•\tUnsweetened almond milk (brands like Malk, Three Trees, Califia Farms)\n\t•\tNatural sweeteners: honey, stevia\n\nAnti-Inflammatory + Hormone Support:\n\t•\tGreen tea/matcha (800mg EGCG extract daily)\n\t•\tTurmeric (1000–1400mg daily or use more in cooking) sidenote - I hear with black pepper helps with absorption \n\t•\tVitamin D (5000 IU with a fat-containing meal - note: my Vitamin D is currently at a 28 so I need this! Your amount may be lower)\n\t•\tVitamin C + iron (for absorption)\n\t•\tOmega-rich foods: salmon 2x/week, walnuts, chia/hemp seeds (daily for seeds)\n\t•\tHigh-fiber plant foods (25g/day): berries, apples, pears\n\t•\tWhole grains: brown rice, sprouted grains/oats, beans/legumes\n\nBonus: Fiber binds excess estrogen — aim for 50%+ of your daily intake from plant-based sources.\n\nI hope this helps ! Thank you again for sharing your stories in this group!",

I also was referred to a hematologist because my iron was insanely low. \n\nIt was so bad it was literally hell on earth. I did lean cuts (or lean ground because it’s easy although not the healthiest.) \n\nIt’s just kinda a shitty viscious cycle. Anemia from fibroids, and then potentially red meat being an aggravator. And eating red meat to replenish the lost iron. \n\nAnyways, I’m in a similar boat and trying to find good iron sources/recipes outside of red meat that are also relatively accessible and affordable, that’s also not toxic in some other way. (Time for some deep dives for new recipes lol)\n\nI hope yours never return! ❤️‍🩹",

        "body": "We need to keep some specifics in mind when discussing this article:\n\n1. **This article says high fat diets can trigger leaky gut, not seed oils.** This is not new research, we have decades of research that show that a high fat diet can trigger a number of autoimmune diseases like IBD, maternal consumption can cause lifelong inflammation, and alter metabolism preference in our bodies, as well as negatively driving microbiome changes.\n2. **IBD is of genetic basis**. Its caused by a disregulated immune system, and not because of microbiome specifically, although microbiome changes can act as a trigger. Leaky gut is a change that is characteristic of an IBD flare.\n3. **We need to talk about the model they use: mic**e. The first major issue with their model is that they dont have a genetically-caused IBD model (again, humans are genetically driven). This means the mouse is just a normal mouse, and then they give it a chemical called DSS. DSS causes crazy inflammation of the mouse gut, and \"looks\" like IBD. Its not actually IBD. Therefore, it is hard to explain how a diet component (seed oils) can be causative of IBD, when the model is trigger based.\n4. **Mice and humans dont respond to seed oils the same way.** We know that it is repeatedly shown in meta-analyses that [seed oils in humans are neutral or mildly anti-inflammatory.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212267212004649?casa_token=baGLY24xZaAAAAAA:kbHLd74Bq3qLMdeC8LX4i8_FZHzjVhl0PJNoE_2RChErtkWsITeHHg5P-IblxnZ7JlcUqNMH) In rodents, they are pro-inflammatory. We have not been able to consistently replicate seed oil-induced inflammation in humans. This is a big limitation of rodent research, because our bodies dont have the same mechanisms for inflammations. All things considered, they are poor models, but the best we currently have.\n\nDo as you wish with your own diet, but keep in mind that science has its limitations, and that its important to read the actual article and not just the news expo about it, because sometimes they get it wrong. **Again, the research article is not about seed oils, it is about a high fat diet**.",

I've been a longtime fan of this community for a few years and have learned so much - excited to be making my first post here and hope to be a more active contributor to this community.\n\n**Some background about my skin**: I'm in my 20s, have NC42 medium dark skin, dry-combination and sometimes sensitive skin. I don't have major issues with acne, but am breakout prone if I'm not careful with watching certain ingredients.\n\n**Reason for this haul + review**: Overall, my routine is focused on anti-aging and I use retinol products and AHAs regularly so sunscreen is very important to me. My current sunscreen goals: 1) No white cast for my skin 2) Alcohol-free (non-negotiable) 3) Newer chemical filters (but avoiding Tinosorb M since it usually leaves a white cast for darker skin) 4) No avobenzone (my skin doesn't love it and I think it's unnecessary in a formulation if there is Tinosorb S and/or Uvinul A Plus present) 5) Fragrance free if possible (I'm lenient on this if fragrance is further down the ingredient list). Before trying Euro sunscreens, my favorites were MISSHA All Around Safe Block Essence Sun SPF 45 PA+++ and Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46. Although I am satisfied with these, I wanted to find a new high PPD (PPD >16) Euro sunscreen that was heftier that I could wear on days when cosmetic elegance wasn't a huge factor for me (makeup-free days, working from home, weekends, going on walks, etc). For me, this is about 4-5 days out of the week, so I thought it was worth it to upgrade to a higher PPD sunscreen even if it wasn't 10/10 on cosmetic elegance (I still sought to avoid extreme shine, heaviness, and white-cast though). I also wanted to find a water-resistant / sweat-resistant sunscreen for outdoor sports and running for both my face and body. I did hours of research of ingredient lists for many sunscreens through COSDNA and narrowed down 11 sunscreens that I wanted to try. Overall, most La-Roche Posay sunscreens had alcohol or avobenzone, so I didn't buy any of those. Most Avene sunscreens had Tinosorb M, so I didn't buy those either. It was definitely an investment to order everything, but I tested them with my sister and mom as well, and we plan on using up sunscreens we don't like on our neck/hands/body. I've been testing all of these for about 3 months during quarantine!\n\n**Where I purchased**: I am located in the US, and found Care to Beauty to be a reputable and very quick international shipper - I HIGHLY recommend them! I found them from research on this sub - they are based in Portugal and carry so many Euro brands. Although there is definitely a markup for the products, I thought it was worth it to buy from a trusted single source rather than searching Ebay and Amazon and being worried about fakes and expired products. DHL shipping was used for all of my orders (I've placed about 3 at this point) and they have arrived in under 10 days.  [https://www.caretobeauty.com/us/](https://www.caretobeauty.com/us/)\n\n**Products + Reviews:**\n\n* **Bioderma Photoderm Max Family Milk SPF 50+ 250ml**\n   * PPD 42\n   * Filters: Uvinul A Plus, Homosalate, Tinosorb S\n   * Fragrance-free and alcohol-free\n   * Shine factor (0 being the least shiny, 5 being the most shiny): 5/5\n   * Review: I was most excited to try this extremely high PPD sunscreen, newly reformulated by Bioderma without Tinosorb M and Avobenzone! Unfortunately, it was a huge fail for me (on my face). Texture wise, it's a quite thick cream, but rubbed in with zero white cast. It was moisturizing but extremely shiny and heavy and never really \"set\" - I used a 1/4 tsp application and could feel it on my skin for the whole day. However, what caused this sunscreen to be a fail for me was breaking out into small acne-like bumps from it (on my cheeks, where I never usually break out).  It almost looked like a rash. Additionally, when I used this on my body for outdoor use it pilled quite a bit - this may be because of body hair and/or the body lotion I used underneath it, but it was noticeable. I was SO surprised and disappointed by this result since Bioderma is such a trusted name in sunscreen and this was supposed to be a gentle, kids-friendly sunscreen as well! Maybe the PPD was too \"strong\" for my skin? Unsure.\n   * **Overall rating: 0/5**\n* **Bioderma Photoderm Max Spray SPF 50+ 400ml**\n   * PPD 33\n   * Filters: Uvinul A Plus, Homosalate, Tinosorb S\n   * Fragrance-free and alcohol-free\n   * Shine Factor: 4.5/5\n   * Review: This was pretty similar to the Family Milk with similar ingredient lists, but overall much thinner and a runny lotion-like texture. I liked it more texture-wise: It was still really shiny, but set to be more \"dewy\" and felt less heavy than the Family Milk. Unfortunately, I experienced a similar breakout from this as well on my face, and my mom got a rash on her face from it (she has very resilient skin and rarely reacts to anything). Once again, I'm very surprised by this, and have truly no idea as to what could be causing it. However, on my body, it did not pill at all, and was actually pretty resilient to sweat when I wore it on my neck/arms/chest for my outdoor run in humid weather. I did not notice it dripping off (it says very water-resistant on the bottle). I bought the 400ml bottle so the $ value is really great - I plan on keeping this for a body/neck/hand sunscreen.\n   * **Overall rating: 3/5**\n* **Uriage Bariésun Fragrance Free Cream SPF 50+ 50ml**\n   * PPD ~~\\~20 (In between 16 - 20, probably closer to 20)~~ at least 20. No exact PPD value stated - for Euro sunscreens, if there is a UVA symbol with a circle around it on the label, that means that the PPD value is at least 1/3 of the SPF. For a SPF of 50, that would mean PPD 16. For an SPF of 50+, that means ~~SPF>59~~ SPF >= 60 and thus PPD ~~> 16 and likely closer to 20~~ \\>= 20, since in the EU SPF labels can only go up to 50+. This explanation is applicable for any subsequent products listed with similar SPF info where I put \"PPD at least 20\". \\****Edit: It seems from a comment below from*** u/dimdim1997  ***that SPF 50+ actually means that the SPF is AT LEAST 60, which means that PPD is at least 20! I'll reflect that in my PPD descriptions to be \"at least 20\" so that it's more clear.***\n   * Filters: Uvinul A Plus, Octinoxate, Tinosorb S\n   * Fragrance-free and alcohol-free\n   * Shine Factor: 3.75/5\n   * Review: This was a medium-weight cream that blended with no white cast onto my skin. It was definitely shiny, but didn't feel \"heavy\" - also, the shininess factor wore down throughout the day. I feel like shiny sunscreens make my skin pores/texture more apparent, so that's the only drawback to shininess for me.  Overall felt moisturizing. Pretty pleasant to use overall!\n   * **Overall rating: 3.75/5**\n* **Uriage Bariésun Fragrance Free Spray SPF 50+ 200ml**\n   * PPD at least 20\n   * Filters: Uvinul A Plus, Octinoxate, Tinosorb S\n   * Fragrance-free and alcohol-free\n   * Shine factor: 3.75/5\n   * Review: The ingredients for this are nearly identical to the Uriage Fragrance Free cream. The feel of it is a runny lotion fluid, but once rubbed in, it felt pretty similar to the cream, just a little lighter. Overall, I feel like buying this would be better value than the cream since it's a similar price but a 200ml bottle (compared to the 50ml cream). I feel like this would be a good multi-purpose body and face sunscreen to have on hand. It also says \"water-resistant\" on the label so it is likely good for sports as well, but I haven't tested it out for that yet.\n   * **Overall rating: 3.75/5**\n* **Heliocare 360 Gel Oil-Free Dry Touch SPF 50 PA++++ 50ml**\n   * PPD 16\n   * Filters: Ensulizole, Neo Heliopan AP, Tinosorb S, Titanium Dioxide, Uvinul A Plus, Uvasorb HEB, Uvinul T 150\n   * Alcohol free, but has fragrance (fragrance is pretty light and further down the ingredient list)\n   * Shine factor: 2/5\n   * Review: The ingredients in this sunscreen are definitely the most interesting! Great assortment of filters, in addition to some antioxidants (including vitamin E and Ferulic acid). This was definitely not a gel texture - it was a lotion texture with a light tan color that disappeared on the skin. It was quite matte on the skin, with not a lot of shine! It felt a tiny bit drying on my skin however (likely due to the dry-touch nature of the sunscreen formula), so I think I could personally only use this in warmer months. However I can see this being great for oilier skin types. The fragrance was light and didn't bother me.\n   * **Overall rating: 4/5**\n* **Heliocare 360 Color Gel Oil-Free SPF 50+ PA++++ 50ml (Color: Bronze)**\n   * PPD at least 20\n   * Filters: Titanium Dioxide, Neo Heliopan HP, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus, Ensulizole, Uvinul T 150, Uvasorb HEB\n   * Alcohol free, but has fragrance\n   * Shine factor: 2/5\n   * Review: I'm generally not a fan of tinted sunscreens (I usually like to use regular sunscreen with my normal makeup powder on top if I want a tint), but I was curious to try this. Although it was tinted about the same color as my NC 42 skin, it surprisingly had a white cast on my skin that the untinted Heliocare version didn't have - I think this is due to Titanium Dioxide being so high up on the ingredient list. Thus, I wasn't a huge fan, and the fragrance seemed stronger to me than the untinted one. The texture was similar to the untinted though.\n   * **Overall rating: 2/5**\n* **SVR Sun Secure Invisible Moisturizing Milk SPF 50+ 250ml**\n   * PPD at least 20\n   * Filters: Homosalate, Uvinul A Plus, Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T 150\n   * Alcohol free, but has fragrance\n   * Shine factor: 3/5\n   * Review: This reminded me of a typical family \"beach sunscreen\": The fragrance was medium-strong (I wasn't a fan of the fragrance, but would describe it as flowery/perfumey), and the texture was a cream-lotion that was decently shiny but blended in with no white cast and didn't feel too heavy. The formula does have niacinamide though which I thought was a great plus. It also says \"very water resistant\" so I would imagine it would be great for pool/sports but I haven't tested it out for that. The only thing holding this back from a top rating for me is the fragrance, but I think the niacinamide is a great addition to this sunscreen, and could function as a great multipurpose body and face sunscreen for most people. Also, the $ value of the tube is great.\n   * **Overall rating: 3.5/5**\n* **SVR Sun Secure Extreme Ultra-Matt Gel SPF 50+ 30ml**\n   * PPD at least 20\n   * Filters: Uvinul A Plus, Homosalate, Octinoxate, Octisalate, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S\n   * Alcohol free, has fragrance\n   * Shine factor: 0/5\n   * Review: This was SUCH an interesting texture and nice surprise - I've never seen anything like it! It came out as a thick, translucent/clear gel, with a very siliconey texture. This is marketed as a sunscreen for sports and heavy outdoor use. When I applied it on the skin, it went on completely clear, and had ZERO shine - it literally looked INVISIBLE on my skin! It didn't \"mattify\" either - it just looked like I literally had no product on my skin. Almost magical. However, I could definitely feel it on my skin since it was such a silicone-heavy product. The fragrance is the same as the previous SVR Sun secure sunscreen and was medium-strong. The major drawback to this is the tiny tiny size (30ml) :( The price isn't worth it to me. I wish it came in a larger bottle, or I'd definitely purchase it again for outdoor use/sports. The texture feels a little too heavy on my skin for a daily use sunscreen. ***Edit: Apparently a 50ml version of this exists! I couldn't find it on the Care to Beauty website when I purchased but feel free to look at other retailers for a 50ml version if you're interested.***\n   * **Overall rating: 4/5**\n* **SVR Sun Secure Optical Blur Mousse Cream SPF 50 50ml**\n   * PPD 16\n   * Filters: Octinoxate, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S\n   * Alcohol free, but has fragrance\n   * Shine factor: 0/5\n   * Review: This was another amazing/interesting texture. It's definitely a mousse - it almost felt like a smoothing primer while applying it. It is apricot colored but was invisible on the skin. Also, it has niacinamide in the formula! It has the same fragrance as the previous SVR sunscreens. It didn't feel as siliconey as the Ultra Matte Gel, wasn't shiny at all, and had a mattifying element to it. The only issue is that the mousse texture makes it a little difficult to apply the proper 1/4 tsp amount. But, I think it's worth trying to if you're in the market for a really cosmetically elegant sunscreen to wear under makeup with primer-like qualities, if you're not bothered by fragrance. Once again, the fragrance is not super strong, but definitely noticeable.\n   * **Overall rating: 4/5**\n* **SVR Sensifine AR Creme SPF 50+ 50 ml**\n   * PPD at least 20\n   * Filters: Uvinul A Plus, Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T 150, Ensulizole\n   * Fragrance-free and alcohol-free\n   * Shine Factor: 2/5\n   * Review: This was my favorite out of the SVRs. Mainly because it did NOT have fragrance, and did not have soybean oil which can be comedogenic for some people and is present in all the other SVR Sun Secure Formulas. It is a lightweight cream with no white cast, and it can be a little shiny, but not awful. I think some strategic translucent powder would be all you need to tone it down. Overall a great daily sunscreen IMO.\n   * **Overall rating: 4.5/5**\n* **SVR Sebiaclear Creme SPF 50 50ml**\n   * PPD 16\n   * Filters: Homosalate, Uvinul A Plus, Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T 150\n   * Alcohol-free but has fragrance\n   * Shine factor 2/5\n   * Review: This felt very similar to the Sensitive AR cream, and didn't really appear more mattifying to me. I think the selling point of this one is that it contains 4% niacinamide (stated on the SVR website), and it also contains salicylic acid. It does have fragrance though. I would personally choose the Sensifine over the Sebiaclear because the former is fragrance free and I like to avoid AHA/BHAs in the AM. But, I could see the Sebiaclear being great for someone with acne-prone skin who likes niacinamide.\n   * **Overall rating: 4/5**\n\n**Overall thoughts**: I'm pleasantly surprised! I was most disappointed by the Bioderma, but I think people should still try it if they're interested since I've seen other positive experiences in this sub with it and the PPD is the best on the market. Since I can't use it on my face, I'm using the Bioderma Spray solely as an outdoor/sports body + neck sunscreen in the future, and I think it's worth repurchasing for my body because of the PPD and the $ value of the bottle (it comes in both 200ml and 400ml - I might buy the 200ml next time so I don't have to worry about it expiring after opening due to not using it up quick enough).  I have settled on the SVR Sensifine as a new daily SPF for me and will definitely repurchase that. I still love my Missha but will reserve that for days when cosmetic elegance is of absolute importance (for example, occasions where I am wearing a full face of makeup during the daytime). For a sports sunscreen for my face, I plan on using the Uriage Fragrance Free Spray because of the $ value of the 200ml bottle.\n\nThanks everyone!! Feel free to ask any questions!\n\n*\\*\\*Edit: A note about PPD for SPF 50+ Euro sunscreens: As I clarified above, SPF 50+ means that SPF is at least 60, which means that PPD is at least 20 (since the UVA with a circle symbol indicates that PPD is at least 1/3 of the SPF value). That said, the PPD COULD be higher than 20 (maybe even significantly higher), but there is no way to know for sure if the manufacturer does not disclose it. While some companies like Bioderma and La Roche Posay do disclose specific PPD values sometimes, others choose not to. I wish this was different, and maybe standards will change in the future! I know there are many Asian PA++++ (PPD = 16) sunscreens that are really well formulated, but for me, the choice to go with Euro for most days is due to the fact that I personally like that they feel more heavy-duty on my skin. I feel more protected physically and mentally, and I like knowing that I'm using the best chemical filters out there for UVA protection. As I mentioned in the comments, I like the idea of having a \"sunscreen rotation.\" This means I use my favorite cosmetically elegant sunscreen (Missha) on days when I wear a lot of makeup or have to go to an event, and save my Euro sunscreen for days when I'm going makeup-free, wearing light makeup, or working out. This works for me, and takes the pressure off of finding \"the best\" sunscreen possible. Hope this helps!*",

        "body": "Thank you so much for all these reviews.  Your review is very timely because I’m about to buy a bunch of sunscreen and was thinking about looking at Euro sunscreens for the same reasons as you. \n\nSome of the ones you reviewed do seem interesting to me.  You c’è generally been very satisfied with Asian sunscreens which are my go to, but there are actually some US sunscreens that I like for body use. There are a couple of US face sunscreens that I like as well.  The problem is that I think avo benzene is the ingredient that causes my eyes to burn like crazy.   That’s a huge problem and the only US sunscreen that doesn’t do that to me is Cerave AM moisturizing spf 30, which I use often in the winter. \n\nFor me the only really attractive point about Euro sunscreens is the potentially higher PPD ratings. However, the ones that offer really high PPD ratings seem to leave an incredibly greasy finish. That’s what you found as well. \n\nI notice that all of the euro sunscreens you found acceptable basically had a PPD rating of approx 16-20.  That really isn’t much better that Asian sunscreens with 4 + ratings because those are also greater than 16 PPD even if the actual rating is not specified. \n\nBased on the above I’m thinking that I will just stick with my Asian sunscreens. I’m wondering if there is anything you experienced with the products you tested to make you think any of them were actually superior to any Asian sunscreens you are familiar with that would make you prefer the Euro sunscreen product? Also, do you think any offer good value vs Asian sunscreens products in terms of price / ml?",

I hate it when something works really well for me and they go reformulate the whole thing. The money spent is no joke either.\n\nI realized too late and already applied it on my whole face without patch testing first so... we'll see how it goes\n\nSo far though...\nConsistency wise, new formula is a bit more watery compared sa old na very thick. \n - New feels a little lighter and less greasy vs. Old thats heavier to the point that u can feel it on you even on the back of my hand.\n - Maybe it could be a good thing with the PH weather. Cant say if the new one is less moisturizing yet but comparing them on my hands, Old formula is more slippery/greasy, new one feels a little matte thats slightly greasy if that makes sense?\n\nScent wise, theres a subtle difference but new one is still unscented.\n\nI'll update in maybe a week and see how it goes. Hopefully it still performs the same and nothing happens to me lmao. So far naman I'm not itching yet lol\n\nHere are the ingredients for comparison!\nTLDR the little search I did: \"One of the former occlusives used was Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, which was replaced by much lighter, less occlusive emollients like ethylhexyl stearate and dicaprylyl carbonate.\" + Added Madecassoside\n\nOLD\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Stearic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arachidyl Alcohol, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA(Ceramide PC-104), Polyacrylate-13, Arachidyl Glucoside, Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Polyisobutene, Glyceryl Caprylate, Panax Ginseng Root Water, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Cholesterol, Bupleurum Falcatum Root Extract, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Glucose, Silica, Glycine Max (Soybean) Oil, Ceramide NP, Phytosphingosine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopherol, Canola Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\nNEW\nPurified water, butylene glycol, glycerin, ethylhexyl stearate, dimethicone, dicaprylyl carbonate, behenyl alcohol, stearic acid, palmitic acid, cetyl ethylhexanoate, hydrogenated poly(C6-14 olefin), 1,2-hexanediol, arachidyl alcohol, C14-22 alcohol, cetyl-pigmentohydroxyethyl palmitamide (ceramide CPP-40 7622 ppm), polyacrylate-13, mannitol, arachidyl glucoside, C12-20 alkyl glucoside, hydrogenated polyisobutene, glyceryl caprylate, ethylhexylglycerin, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, hydrogenated lecithin, ethylhexyl palmitate, Dimethiconol, Ginseng Water, Carbomer, Sorbitan Isostearate, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Gold Extract, Propanediol, Cholesterol, Silica, Plum Extract, Arachidic Acid, Black Soybean Oil, Squalane Madecassoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Pentastearate, Tocopherol, Ceramide NP (4ppm), Oleic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Pentylene Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Canola Oil, Rosemary Leaf Extract",

I used it side by side one day and the side with the new formula didn’t feel as heavy and the finger swipe wasn’t as greasy.\n* I’m not sure if its viable as a morning moisturizer now, but I did use it as such under my Omi Sunbears Sunscreen. \n   * I avoided using this sunscreen when I damaged my skin barrier as it dried so matte it made my skin so dry and my old moisturizers *(Hyaloo and Klued)* weren’t enough for it. But the new formula was just right to keep me moisturized but not oily with this sunscreen\n\nPART 1/2",

    "body": "It dawned on me a little while ago that I never really see skinny people with a healthy look anymore; they're usually either rake thin and malnourished looking, or pathetically skinnyfat.\n\nThe contrast is particularly apparent against photos, film and memories of everyday people from as recently as twenty years ago. While modern people are less active, have less muscle mass due to this sedentarism, and testosterone in both genders has been declining for a few generations, it doesn't explain why they simply lack any shape at all. Back in the day, the only people I remember possessing such plainly unremarkable physiques were approaching their seventies, or had an endocrine disorder. I saw parts of a Woodstock documentary years ago and noticed how their bodies universally resembled those still found among the active, healthy tribes of Africa and Papua New Guinea.\n\nMany decently fit (natural) people these days have a kind of extra layer of softness covering their muscles. I've read and heard countless complaints from people on the classic chicken, broccoli, rice and \"healthy\" fats diet about how hard it is to get lean. Yet, the healthy people of yesteryear remained lean and metabolically fit while regularly eating much more red meat, dairy and saturated fats. Given what we know about seed oils' metabolism destroying power and the fact that many people consume foodstuffs which are near devoid of meaningful nourishment, it's quite obvious what has been driving this modern phenomenon.\n\nAs previously stated, hormones are also a significant factor. Numerous studies have shown that muscle can be effortlessly gained when on even a small testosterone cycle, and we can assume that higher natural levels result in more muscle mass that wasn't intentionally built. A lack of dietary cholesterol — the building block of testosterone and vitamin D produced autologously from the Sun's rays, malnutrition from junk food rich diets and pollution all play a part as well. The latter two — and arguably also the third due to plastic junk food packaging — all implicate seed oils and a disinformed avoidance of healthy, saturated fats. Soybean oil is terribly efficient at [wrecking one's gut microbiome](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/widely-consumed-vegetable-oil-leads-unhealthy-gut), which plays an important role in endocrine and general health. There's also the factor that \"[Low-fat diets appear to decrease testosterone levels in men, but further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm this effect. Men with European ancestry may experience a greater decrease in testosterone, in response to a low-fat diet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960076021000716)\". Regardless of how you slice it, consuming \"healthy\" fats in the form of seed oils or completely succumbing to the fat fear hysteria will produce a similar hormonal dysfunction.\n\nWhat is your opinion on the matter? Who else here easily shed their skinnyfat layer after excluding seed oils from their diet?",

    "body": "One of anti-vaxxers main arguments against vaccines is the ingredients and how dangerous they are. So lets look at all these so called dangerous ingredients and find out why they are as dangerous as they sound. This is going to be a long post. \n\n**Note: I got the ingredients from a antivax website since they got all of these ingredients together and is easier to jump from that to other websites. So I'll list the ingredient, what that website has to say about that and info on why it's safe.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aluminum-** The website says that it causes brain damage at all doses, linked to Alzheimer's, dementia, seizures, autoimmune issues (not specific on what issues), SIDS (what? iirc it has no know cause) and cancer (again not specific).\n\nHealth individuals can consume up to 7.2 grams daily. The highest dosage of aluminum is in the DTAP, inactivated polio and HPV vaccine at <0.85 mg/dose (one milligram is one thousandth of a gram). These doses all range but the ones I mentioned earlier is highest. A baby may consume about 4.4 milligrams from vaccines in the first six months. If you have a baby you'll either breast feed them, use formula or soy formula. In the same time the babies will consume 7 milligrams, 38 milligrams and almost 117 milligrams respectively. \n\nRegarding diseases there could be an aluminium build up causing Alzheimer's but the association is not completely understood. So it can be the truth or just pure coincidence. This could be the same with the other diseases mentioned as well.\n\n[https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum)\n\n[https://esemag.com/archive/0197/facts.html](https://esemag.com/archive/0197/facts.html) (may be outdated).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formaldehyde-** One of the most famous ingredients used as an argument by antivaxxers. This website mentions that it causes cancer in humans, poisoning of certain body systems like liver and respiratory, immune, reproductive, and nervous system. And apparently banned in injectbales by certain European countries. \n\nIn regards to the last point they made there seems to be now articles relating to it that I could find unless I looked in the wrong places. Formaldehyde is dangerous but it is naturally occurring in foods like apples, grapes, bananas, grapes, onions, carrots, spinach, seafood, beef and poultry. As well as our body naturally producing it for metabolism and production of certain amino acids. The highest dosage in a vaccine is .02 mg per dose, an average two month old will have 1.1 mg circulating in their bodies. The FDA also reports that 50 to 70 times more formaldehyde present in an average newborn's body than in a single vaccine. Although formaldehyde is dangerous the dose would not affect the newborn due to the fact there is more naturally occurring.\n\n[https://foodinsight.org/chemicals-in-food-two-that-arent-as-scary-as-they-sound/](https://foodinsight.org/chemicals-in-food-two-that-arent-as-scary-as-they-sound/)\n\n[https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine/](https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine/)\n\n[https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm187810.htm](https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm187810.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beta-Propiolactone-** The website states that it's know to cause cancer and poison certain organs.\n\nLets start with what is BP? It's an organic compound, colorless, highly reactive and is highly soluble in water. It's vapor form is irritating but the liquid form is carcinogenic. It is used to treat influenza and is dosed in 2-1000 micrometers (1000 micrometers = 1mm). For the lowest dose to have an effect was 5ppm (0.005g/kg) via the inhalation of rat which had turmorgenic effect. The other tests showed the next one being 40mg/kg to have an effect. So the low dose would not have an effect on the individual.\n\n[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=Top](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=Top)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24140008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24140008)\n\n[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=NIOSH-Toxicity-Data&fullscreen=true](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=NIOSH-Toxicity-Data&fullscreen=true)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gentamicin Sulfate & Polymyxin B-** The website says that it causes allergic reactions from mild to life threatening.\n\nThis can easily be avoided already by consulting on doctor to see if you child is allergic to these. Both these chemicals are antibiotics used in vaccinations and other things like surgical equipment. Gentamicin is only used in a one vaccines, influenza at a mega dose of <0.00015 mg. Polymyxin B is used in 5 vaccines: Influenza (<0.011 mg), Polio (0.00025 mg), Diptheria, tetanus, pretussis, polio (<0.00000001 mg, <0.00000004 mg, <0.00000001 mg). \n\n[https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/antibiotics](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/antibiotics)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Viral DNA-** The website says it can cause genetic mutations. \n\nFrom what I've found, they are not a common ingredient inside vaccines like polio, measles etc. Except their own vaccine. It is a developing vaccine which could be potentially used for chronic infections. There should be no issue at all for the individuals DNA to be affected at all.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15906276](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15906276)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Glutaraldehyde-** Website says poisonous if INGESTED mind you and causes birth defects in animals.\n\nGlutaraldehyde is a disinfectant used to sterilize hospital equipment. Found in the diptheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine in doses of <50ng (nanograms). If you are exposed to <1ppm = 1mg/L through inhalation or skin contact irritation and mucus. Higher dosages would be required to be needed to be considered dangerous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Latex Rubber-** Website says can cause life-threatening reactions.\n\nIt ain't a motherfucking ingredient but they include it. Latex rubber is used for the tip of syringes. Regarding with if you're allergic to latex it can be administered if the benefits outweighs the risks. Also there was a study of 28 people regarding with the reactions, only 2 needed to be hospitalized. \n\n[https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/25/latex-allergies-and-vaccines/](https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/25/latex-allergies-and-vaccines/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Peanut and Soybean Oil-** Website says it's linked to nut and soy allergies so they say that vaccines cause allergies. The only way your are at risk of allergies are if your family has had a history of allergies, are a child or have asthma or other similar conditions. Foods can be a trigger for allergies but are not a cause.\n\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Human and Animal Cells (Oh Boy!)-** Website says how vaccines have aborted babies DNA, pig and horse blood, dog kidneys, cow hearts, monkey kidneys, chick embryos, calf serum, sheep blood. Also causes leukemia and diabetes. \n\nThe fun one. These aborted fetal cells, from elective termination of pregnancies in the 1960's. They are not inside the vaccine but are used to help create the viruses. These two embryonic cells have been maintained in a laboratory for years so we won't need new sources. Most of the animal DNA is used to help grow viruses and are not used in a vaccine.\n\nDiabetes have no known cause and they won't cause leukemia.\n\n[https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues)\n\n[http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#human-cell-strains](http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#human-cell-strains)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mercury (Thimerosal)-** Website says that it is one of the most toxic substances ever known, when a thermometer breaks a HAZMAT teams has to clean it, small doses causes damage and causes autism (I shortened what they said fyi)\n\nThimerosal is a type of mercury and is the safer type of mercury. There are two types of mercury: methylmercury found in fish and high dosages can be toxic, ethylmecury which is what thimerosal is. It is more easier to clear from the body making it safer to be used. Thimerosal is used in multi-dose vials to prevent bacteria from growing. This prevents illness even death from the germs. Thimerosal has no time to build up as it is broken down straight away as well as many studies showing that thimerosal at low doses cause no harm. As for Autism, well you know it does't this expert website below will show you why.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html)\n\n[http://howdovaccinescauseautism.com/](http://howdovaccinescauseautism.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)-** Website says that is linked to birth defects, developmental delays and infertility. As well as being banned in europe.\n\nRegarding being banned it's a gray area. The FDA says it can be included just has to be included on the label. MSG is the sodium salt for glutamaic acid. Glutamic acid naturally occurs in tomatoes, grapes, cheese, mushrooms and other foods. There has been anecdotal reactions from MSG in food including headaches, flushing, sweating, facial pressure, numbness in face and neck, heart palpitations, chest pain, nausea and weakness although studies has found that there is no link between MSG and those issues. Although a small percentage of people may experience a small reaction. It is only found in two vaccines adenovirus and influenza.\n\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196)\n\n[https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine/](https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neomycin Sulphate-** Website says interferes with B6 absorption which leads to epilepsy and brain damage. Allergic reactions which can be mild to life threatening.\n\nNeomycin is an antibiotic used to reduce the risk of infection during surgeries on the bowel. Neomycin is used to prevent germs from growing and are usually removed from the final vaccine. B6 is found in many foods and helps with protein metabolism along with other body functions. Vitamin B6 defiency leads to dermatitis and glosstis, depression, confusion and weakened immune system. No signs of epilepsy or brain damage. Babies only need 0.1 mg from birth - 6 months. This can be easily achieved from any food as they provide the recommended amount or more.\n\n[https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/11/neomycin-in-vaccines/](https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/11/neomycin-in-vaccines/)\n\n[https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Phenol-** Website says is used as anti-freeze. Toxic to all cells and can destroy the immune system. \n\nPhenol is an organic compound used in household items like disinfectants and mouthwash. It was also the first antiseptic used in surgery in 1865. When it was used the mortality rate dropped from 45%-15%. Phenol is also used for explosives like picric acid, drugs like aspirin. It also found naturally in tryosine (an amino acid in proteins), adrenaline, a hormone, serontonin in a neurotransmitter and urushoil.\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/science/phenol](https://www.britannica.com/science/phenol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Polysorbate 80-** Website says it causes cancer in animals. Causes numerous autoimmune diseases and infertility.\n\nPolysorbate 80 is an emulsifier used in foods and cosmetic products. There is only 50 micrograms inside of a typical vaccine, in comparison to a ice cream scoop (1/2 cup) which contains 170,000 micrograms. The effects of polysorbate is commonly irritations in the skin and other places. It is found to cause cancer in animals but not it humans\n\n[https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients)\n\n[https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+4359](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+4359)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tributyl Phosphate-** Website says it is potentially toxic to the kidney and nervous system.\n\nBreathing TDP causes irritation and mucus. If its prolonged there can be poisoning with paralysis. If it comes in contact with skin then it can cause irritation it may also cause irritation on the eyes, nose and throat. So the low doses in vaccines would not be dangerous.\n\n[https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+1678](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+1678)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is it for now. These are the main ingredients these antivaxxers use for their arguments. Of course there is a lot more so if you want more than ask. This took a lot of time to do.",

It was suggested i share it here as well in case other \"older\" folks wanted to ask questions about the process. I am 52 and have been working out since i have been about 20. I have done a little bit of everything over the years and have maintained a good level of fitness. A few years ago we moved away from our beloved Lifetime gym out to the country and my gym attendance slacked. I did a lot of running and body weight exercises but as i am getting older no matter how hard i worked i couldn't out work my crappy diet. Sadly, my diet was pretty much what is recommended to us by the AHA. Low fat high carb for thirty years. It worked for me when i calorie restricted but during those times i was always hungry. Even that changed as i got older. I couldnt restrict enough to lose weight.  I started listening to people talk about the research that really takes fat off the hot seat and puts it on sugar. Joe Rogan and Dr Rhonda Patrick, That Sugar Film, The Magic Pill Movie and a number of books by Gary Taub. I decided what i was doing wasn't working, my blood tests came back bad again, high cholesterol, insulin resistant and i just couldn't lose weight even running twenty plus miles a week and doing a lot of body weight exercises. \n\nAt that point we decided to build our home gym and i started doing the Athlean X  AX-1 program and at the same time got rid of as much processed sugar from my diet as is humanly possible. I eat about 150-175 grams of protein a day, i still eat carbs which consist of fruit, (everything i have read says fruit sugar within reasonable limits is ok), vegetables, some potatoes and oatmeal. I'm not militant about pasta and bread but i have cut back dramatically. I eat pretty much whatever fats i want except for the processed vegetable oils like Canola and Soybean oil. My Macros stay close to 33/33/33 Essentially i dont eat much that has a label on it anymore and if it does i read both the macro content and what the ingredients are. Soybean oil is potentially estrogenic and bad for male testosterone. Sugar also crushes male hormone production. Anyhow, ten weeks of hard work and strict monitoring of processed sugar along with a 500 calorie deficit daily has lead to a change that even surprised me. I know how to work out. I have done triathlons, raced bicycles, had an ACSM certification and was a personal trainer when i first got out of college. What i didn't get was how hard the low fat high carb diet was making it to keep the pounds off. Also, with the switch to more satiating foods i am rarely hungry even in a deficit. Anyhow here is the 10 week progress picture. I havent stepped on a scale since i took the left side picture but i was about 206 there. I am guessing i am about 185 now. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/3GaHoTG](https://imgur.com/a/3GaHoTG)\n\nEdit: softened my statement on soybean oil due to not really having the research to back it up. ",

Recently, increased consumption of soybean oil, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been proposed to play a causal role in the epidemic. Here, we designed a series of four isocaloric diets (HFD, SO-HFD, F-HFD, F-SO-HFD) to investigate the effects of saturated versus unsaturated fat, as well as fructose, on obesity and diabetes. C57/BL6 male mice fed a diet moderately high in fat from coconut oil and soybean oil (SO-HFD, 40% kcal total fat) showed statistically significant increases in weight gain, adiposity, diabetes, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared to mice on a diet consisting primarily of coconut oil (HFD). They also had fatty livers with hepatocyte ballooning and very large lipid droplets as well as shorter colonic crypt length. While the high fructose diet (F-HFD) did not cause as much obesity or diabetes as SO-HFD, it did cause rectal prolapse and a very fatty liver, but no balloon injury. The coconut oil diet (with or without fructose) increased spleen weight while fructose in the presence of soybean oil increased kidney weight. Metabolomics analysis of the liver showed an increased accumulation of PUFAs and their metabolites as well as γ-tocopherol, but a decrease in cholesterol in SO-HFD. Liver transcriptomics analysis revealed a global dysregulation of cytochrome P450 (Cyp) genes in SO-HFD versus HFD livers, most notably in the Cyp3a and Cyp2c families. Other genes involved in obesity (e.g., Cidec, Cd36), diabetes (Igfbp1), inflammation (Cd63), mitochondrial function (Pdk4) and cancer (H19) were also upregulated by the soybean oil diet. Taken together, our results indicate that in mice a diet high in soybean oil is more detrimental to metabolic health than a diet high in fructose or coconut oil.\n>",

Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  \n\n**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion.

This “Vegan curried tofu fried rice– One wok in under 15 minutes!” is packed with flavor and so appetizing, also super easy to make. (It’s probably quicker to make your own than waiting for food delivery!)\n\nThis golden vegan curried tofu fried rice is totally customizable – just add what you want. Pick the curry powder( spicy or mild) and vegetables you like. Make it your own favorite version!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n3 Tbsp Cooking Oil (Note1)  \n150 g Firm Tofu  \n50 g Onion  \n70 g Carrot  \n50 g Green Bean  \n40 g Spring Onion  \n700 g Cold Cooked Rice (Note2)  \n4 tsp Curry Powder (Note3)  \n3/4 tsp Salt  \nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFirstly, we turn firm tofu into tofu crumbles. Then we chop onion, carrot, green bean, and spring onion into small dice. The stir-frying process is all about quick, so you need to make sure all the ingredients are ready to cook before turn on the gas.  \nHeat up cooking oil in the wok on medium-high heat, add onion, carrot, green bean, and tofu in, saute until veggies are softened and tofu is slightly golden brown.  \nAdd cooked cold rice into the wok, stirring constantly until rice is heated up.  \nAdd curry powder, stir and mix with rice till fully coated.  \nAdd spring onion, then quickly stir for a minute, then ready to serve! (Note4)\n\nNote1: for stir-frying, you need oil with a high smoking point such as Vegetable oil, peanut oil, soybean oil…etc.  \nNote2: you need at least a day-old cold rice. If you don’t have leftover rice, you can cook fresh rice, spread them evenly on a tray, and leave it in the fridge until it’s cold and dry. Freshly cooked rice also works fine.  \nNote3: Pick a brand you like, spicy or mild is totally your choice!  \nNote4: Serve with fried shallot or chili oil!

        "body": "## Abstract\n\n>The obesity epidemic in the U.S. has led to extensive research into potential contributing dietary factors, especially fat and fructose. Recently, increased consumption of soybean oil, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been proposed to play a causal role in the epidemic. Here, we designed a series of four isocaloric diets (HFD, SO-HFD, F-HFD, F-SO-HFD) to investigate the effects of saturated versus unsaturated fat, as well as fructose, on obesity and diabetes. C57/BL6 male mice fed a diet moderately high in fat from coconut oil and soybean oil (SO-HFD, 40% kcal total fat) showed statistically significant increases in weight gain, adiposity, diabetes, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared to mice on a diet consisting primarily of coconut oil (HFD). They also had fatty livers with hepatocyte ballooning and very large lipid droplets as well as shorter colonic crypt length. While the high fructose diet (F-HFD) did not cause as much obesity or diabetes as SO-HFD, it did cause rectal prolapse and a very fatty liver, but no balloon injury. The coconut oil diet (with or without fructose) increased spleen weight while fructose in the presence of soybean oil increased kidney weight. Metabolomics analysis of the liver showed an increased accumulation of PUFAs and their metabolites as well as γ-tocopherol, but a decrease in cholesterol in SO-HFD. Liver transcriptomics analysis revealed a global dysregulation of cytochrome P450 (*Cyp*) genes in SO-HFD versus HFD livers, most notably in the *Cyp3a* and *Cyp2c* families. Other genes involved in obesity (e.g., *Cidec*, *Cd36*), diabetes (*Igfbp1*), inflammation (*Cd63*), mitochondrial function (*Pdk4*) and cancer (*H19*) were also upregulated by the soybean oil diet. Taken together, our results indicate that in mice a diet high in soybean oil is more detrimental to metabolic health than a diet high in fructose or coconut oil.\n\nLink goes to the full article - I haven't read it yet.\n\nSource: [https://twitter.com/Mangan150/status/1023563322589831169](https://twitter.com/Mangan150/status/1023563322589831169)",

I am a medical doctor and have spent the past year writing online blog posts that other Reddit communities have enjoyed. I wanted to share this article with this community, as I felt some of you may find it interesting or informative. It is relatively detailed and occasionally technical. The [full blog post](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulinresistance/) exceeds the allowed character limit on Reddit, so the sections on Aerobic Exercise, Strength Training, Sleep, and Medications were truncated from the Reddit post. Have a great day.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nInsulin resistance is arguably the most significant health abnormality affecting humankind. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of insulin resistance in adults, adolescents, and children highlights the growing threat that insulin resistance poses to individuals of all ages. While insulin resistance is typically associated with obesity, **insulin resistance can also affect those with a normal body weight**.^(1-3) To demonstrate this point, it is estimated that 16% of school-aged children with a normal body weight have insulin resistance.^(4) While it is widely recognized that insulin resistance contributes to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance also contributes to a constellation of serious and disabling health abnormalities, including several types of cancer, dementia, liver disease, kidney disease, osteoarthritis, muscle loss, frailty, and infertility.^(5-12) Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that insulin resistance is a stronger risk factor of cardiovascular disease than elevated levels of LDL-C and Apolipoprotein B ([Link](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance)).^(13) Therefore, the early identification of insulin resistance is necessary for those seeking to promote longevity and avoid preventable medical illness.\n\nMeanwhile, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the most commonly utilized test for assessing blood glucose control. However, **HbA1c is not an optimal test for identifying insulin resistance**. Specifically, it is a measurement of long-term blood glucose control and lacks the sensitivity to detect early stages of insulin resistance in those with normal blood glucose control (Figure 1).^(14,15) As a result, the standard approach to diagnosing insulin resistance using HbA1c often allows insulin resistance to go undiagnosed until significant health problems arise. Similarly, Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) measure blood glucose fluctuations but may miss insulin resistance among those who are able to maintain normal blood glucose control, despite elevated levels of circulating insulin. Therefore, an optimal strategy is to utilize superior tests that identify insulin resistance prior to the onset of blood glucose dysregulation. This includes the [**LPIR Score**](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance/#LPIR), [**Triglyceride-Glucose Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/) ([**TyG Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)), and [**HOMA-IR**](https://kevinforeymd.com/HOMA-IR/).\n\nImportantly, **insulin resistance is reversible in many cases**, especially when addressed early with comprehensive lifestyle changes. Strategies to prevent insulin resistance are similar to the strategies used to reverse insulin resistance. This generally includes dietary modification, physical fitness, and the optimization of sleep and stress. In select instances, supplements and prescription medications can also be effective, however, **optimizing food and nutrition and physical fitness is more effective than medications** **alone**.^(16) Meanwhile, multiple strategies can be utilized simultaneously to maximize the likelihood of success. While the restriction of saturated fat is commonly recommended for the sake of reducing LDL cholesterol, this has no appreciable impact on improving insulin resistance.^(17) Therefore, we will explore evidence-based strategies capable of improving insulin resistance and other components of Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n[Original Blog Post](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulinresistance/)\n\n[Related Podcast Episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-9-insulin-resistance-a-protocol-for/id1723056246?i=1000701568405)\n\n**Content Summary**\n\n* **Insulin resistance is more than a risk factor of type 2 diabetes**. It is also a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, liver disease, kidney disease, infertility, osteoarthritis, and frailty.^(5-12) Furthermore, **insulin resistance can also affect those with a normal body weight**.^(1-3)\n* **Hemoglobin A1c, CGM, and fasting glucose tests often fail to detect early stages of insulin resistance**, as the body can maintain normal blood glucose values despite insulin resistance.^(14,15) **Elevated levels of insulin are toxic to the body** and occur years or decades before the onset of blood glucose dysregulation and abnormalities in HbA1c and CGM.^(14,15)\n* **The most effective tests for detecting insulin resistance early** include include the [Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance (LPIR) Score](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance/#LPIR), [Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) Index](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/), and [HOMA-IR](https://kevinforeymd.com/homa-ir/). For early stages of insulin resistance, these tests are more accurate and sensitive compared to HbA1c or CGM.^(18-30)\n* Importantly, **insulin resistance is reversible in many cases**, especially when addressed early with comprehensive lifestyle changes that optimize food, nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and stress. Supplements and medications are also effective, however, comprehensive lifestyle changes appear most effective.^(16) Meanwhile, all strategies can be used simultaneously.\n* **Optimizing food and nutrition appears to be the most powerful tool for improving insulin resistance**.^(38) Meanwhile, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (Zone 2) may be as effective, or even more effective, than high-intensity aerobic exercise.^(38) Although aerobic exercise appears more effective than strength training alone, the combined benefit of aerobic exercise and strength training appear greater than the individual benefits of each modality alone.^(38) Therefore, **it is advisable to prioritize the combination of food and nutrition, aerobic exercise, and strength training, for the prevention and reversal of insulin resistance**.\n* The **Toxic Food Hypothesis** proposes that **highly processed foods disproportionately contribute to insulin resistance** through two primary mechanisms. (1) **Overconsumption**: excess calorie intake compared to whole foods;^(42) and (2) **Metabolic Dysfunction**: even at equal caloric intake, highly processed foods uniquely damage metabolic health.^(43)\n* Rather than mainstream nutritional guidelines to *“maintain a healthy energy balance”* and to *“eat everything in moderation,”* a more effective approach to the prevention and reversal of insulin resistance is to **minimize or eliminate the regular consumption of highly processed foods**, including simple sugars and flour-based food products.\n* **Improving the** **quality** **of carbohydrates consumed is likely more important than simply reducing the** **quantity** **of carbohydrates consumed**. Replacing simple sugars alone with complex carbohydrates results in appreciable reductions in body weight, insulin resistance, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, independent of calorie intake.^(43)\n* **Reducing carbohydrate intake can raise ApoB levels**. To mitigate potential ApoB increases, strategies include increasing soluble and insoluble fiber intake, avoiding saturated fat intake from highly processed foods and industrially raised livestock, cooking with avocado oil instead of butter or coconut oil, and considering select plant-based meat alternative products.\n* **Time-restricted eating may also improve insulin resistance independently of calorie reduction**, especially when meals are consumed earlier in the day to align with circadian rhythms.^(62,63) Importantly, the evidence remains mixed and more research is needed to confirm whether or not there are unique benefits of time-restricted eating over calorie restriction.^(64,65)\n* **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) offer** instant, visual feedback, that can help to influence positive lifestyle changes, especially in those **with** insulin resistance. Meanwhile, in individuals **without** insulin resistance, the role of CGMs remains less clear due to the lack of reproducibility and consistency in CGM reported glucose values.^(66)\n* **Optimizing sleep and managing stress are critical** for improving insulin sensitivity. Even modest sleep deprivation or sleep fragmentation can significantly impair insulin action. Sleep quality, quantity, and timing are all important considerations regarding insulin resistance.^(87-94)\n* **Medications and supplements such as Metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and berberine** can be helpful adjuncts in treating insulin resistance, especially when combined with lifestyle changes. Each has a distinct mechanism of action and set of side effects.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis content is for general educational purposes only and does not represent medical advice or the practice of medicine.

Under normal circumstances, the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream to regulate blood glucose levels. Insulin achieves blood glucose control by facilitating glucose uptake into liver, muscle, and fat tissue. It also plays a foundational role in directing fat storage and protein synthesis. The amount of insulin released by the pancreas is influenced by several factors, including the type of food consumed, the amount consumed, recent physical activity, stress levels, inflammation, pre-existing metabolic health, and other hormonal considerations.\n\nIn the case of insulin resistance, the body becomes less effective in its ability to respond to the hormone insulin. As a result, the body will compensate by releasing increased amounts of insulin into the circulation, a condition known as hyperinsulinemia. Importantly, **hyperinsulinemia can occur before the onset of blood glucose dysregulation or elevations in blood glucose levels**, implying that insulin resistance can exist before the onset of abnormalities seen in HbA1c or CGM.^(14,15) Meanwhile, even with normal blood glucose control, it is recognized that **elevated levels of insulin contribute to** **a toxic health environment, resulting in chronic inflammation, organ damage, and cellular dysfunction**. More specifically, while insulin resistance is widely recognized to contribute to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease, several types of cancer, and dementia.^(5,6,31,32) Insulin resistance also contributes to liver disease, kidney disease, and the increasing need for dialysis and organ transplantation.^(7,8) Furthermore, insulin resistance is also associated with several disabling conditions, including osteoarthritis, muscle loss, frailty, and infertility (Table 2).^(9-12) Collectively, the United States spends more money treating the abnormalities of type 2 diabetes than any other health condition, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.^(33)\n\nBeyond insulin resistance is a broader health abnormality known as Metabolic Syndrome, which often manifests as some combination of excess abdominal obesity (visceral adiposity), high blood pressure (hypertension), elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and inflammation. It is estimated that 85% of adults have at least one component of Metabolic Syndrome, with insulin resistance being the primary, underlying health abnormality of this broader condition.^(34) While many health experts and public health guidelines focus on body weight, often measured by Body Mass Index (BMI), and the restriction of calorie intake to improve body weight, Metabolic Syndrome is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease than BMI alone (Table 2).^(13) Meanwhile, Metabolic Syndrome captures additional risk associated with poor metabolic health to a far greater degree than body weight or BMI alone. Therefore, it is advisable to view comprehensive metabolic health from the standpoint of Metabolic Syndrome, insulin resistance, and its relationship to abnormal lipoprotein (cholesterol) concentrations, rather than body weight and obesity alone. Once again, you do not have to be overweight to have insulin resistance or other abnormalities of Metabolic Syndrome.^(4)\n\n**Table 1.

Association of Risk Factors and Cardiovascular Disease**^(13)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbntadlzi1se1.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e2abc182bf99ccae3e3e1cd596c1c3e4f693fd\n\n**Early and Accurate Identification of Insulin Resistance**\n\nBecause insulin resistance can exist before the onset of blood glucose dysregulation, traditional blood tests such as fasting glucose levels and HbA1c often fail to detect insulin resistance in its early stages.^(14,15) As a result, insulin resistance may exist for years or decades before abnormalities in HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, or CGMs are observed. \n\nFurthermore, [**HbA1c can also be elevated in healthy individuals without insulin resistance**](https://kevinforeymd.com/hemoglobina1c/). Perhaps the most common circumstance in which a healthy individual may have an elevated HbA1c includes endurance athletes who are observed to have higher fasting glucose levels, likely due to the body’s regular demand for circulating blood glucose during times of prolonged physical activity, resulting in upregulated gluconeogenesis (increased production of glucose in the liver and kidneys).^(35) Other potential factors include those with a prolonged red blood cell lifespan, iron deficiency, and certain medications. \n\nThese examples of the limitations of HbA1c underscore the importance of utilizing tests that more directly assess insulin resistance compared to Hemoglobin A1c. Rather than utilizing a single biomarker alone, a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of insulin resistance should utilize the combination of the LPIR Score, TyG Index, HOMA-IR, and other assessments of metabolic health (Table 3).\n\n* [**Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance Score**](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance#LPIR) ([**LPIR Score**](https://kevinforeymd.com/insulin-resistance#LPIR)): A useful blood test that analyzes changes in lipoprotein particle size and concentration to determine the presence and severity of insulin resistance. It is particularly helpful in detecting early stages of insulin resistance, including those with a normal body weight and normal blood glucose control.^(18,19) Notably, the LPIR Score was developed and validated using data from the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, which is the most precise method for measuring insulin resistance (“the gold standard”). Because the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp is labor-intensive, it is only used in research settings and not available as a routine laboratory test. Instead, the LPIR Score bridges this gap by providing a simple blood test that is a highly reliable surrogate marker of insulin resistance, and calibrated to the gold standard for measuring insulin resistance.\n* [**Triglyceride-Glucose Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/) ([**TyG Index**](https://kevinforeymd.com/tygindex/)): This index is calculated using a formula that combines fasting triglyceride and fasting glucose levels, making it both cost-effective, accessible, and another useful test for detecting insulin resistance.^(20) Research has demonstrated the TyG Index to be a superior predictor of insulin resistance compared to HbA1c and HOMA-IR.^(20) Beyond insulin resistance, **the TyG Index is strongly associated with lifespan (all-cause mortality), frailty, multiple types of cancer including breast and colon cancer, and dementia**.^(21-27)\n* [**HOMA-IR**](https://kevinforeymd.com/HOMA-IR/): Another widely used test that utilizes fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. While HOMA-IR is highly sensitive, it is also susceptible to large day-to-day fluctuations in fasting insulin and glucose levels that may be influenced by factors unrelated to insulin resistance.^(28-30) Therefore, HOMA-IR should be interpreted in conjunction with other testing strategies to provide a comprehensive analysis of insulin resistance.\n* **Hemoglobin A1c** (**HbA1c**): A measurement of long-term blood glucose control, not insulin resistance.  While there is a strong degree of correlation between blood glucose dysregulation and insulin resistance, the use of **HbA1c is best for monitoring long-term blood glucose control in those with advanced states of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes**. Meanwhile, it appears less helpful for detecting early stages of insulin resistance. \n\n**Table 3. Early and Accurate Identification of Insulin Resistance**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49f2kq01j1se1.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=57628d4943e95390590c351a93197de0f90c6702\n\n**Figure 1. Stages of Insulin Resistance**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2ph6753j1se1.png?width=2290&format=png&auto=webp&s=95c65a9a9c5e0d078614a06ffaea9d01685312a1\n\n**Strategies to Prevent and Reverse Insulin Resistance**\n\nThere are a variety of effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance. This includes dietary modification, physical fitness, optimization of sleep, stress management, and in some instances, supplements and prescription medications. The same strategies used to reverse insulin resistance are typically effective for the prevention of insulin resistance. However, among those who are metabolically healthy and without evidence of insulin resistance, there is more leniency in the degree of adherence to these strategies necessary to prevent insulin resistance. Meanwhile, for those with insulin resistance, poor metabolic health, and/or a family history of insulin resistance, it is reasonable to implement as many of these strategies as possible. Additionally, it is advantageous to remain as disciplined as possible in following these strategies. Meanwhile, all individuals will respond differently to these interventions, and professional guidance from a licensed healthcare professional is necessary for ensuring safety. \n\n**Food, Nutrition, and Physical Fitness**\n\nWhen evaluating the relative effectiveness of aerobic exercise, strength training, and dietary modification, all are effective strategies for reversing and preventing insulin resistance. However, clinical trials have demonstrated that **dietary modification is the single most impactful strategy for reversing insulin resistance** (Figure 2).^(38) Meanwhile, **moderate-intensity aerobic exercise appears to be equally as effective, or more effective, than vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise**. Both **moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise appear more effective than strength training in isolation**. Interestingly, the combination of aerobic exercise and strength training demonstrates a positive synergistic effect, for which **the combined benefit of aerobic exercise and strength training appear greater than the individual benefits of each modality**. Importantly, the greatest benefits in overcoming insulin resistance are achieved with the combination of maximizing and optimizing food and nutrition, aerobic exercise, and strength training. \n\n**Figure 2. Impact of Aerobic Exercise, Strength Training, and Dietary Modification on Insulin Sensitivity**^(38)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8yc2tk8j1se1.png?width=2140&format=png&auto=webp&s=6223b4a83dba3c3ef40047fe1c9cb9fa7530a2b4\n\nNote: The unit kcal/kg of body weight/week (KKW) is a measure of the prescribed amount of exercise in terms of energy expenditure relative to body weight over a one-week period.\n\n**Optimizing Food and Nutrition**\n\nFood and nutrition likely represents the most important modifiable risk factor regarding insulin resistance and the array of health abnormalities associated with Metabolic Syndrome. Meanwhile, the subject of food and nutrition is highly controversial, with conflicting perspectives and nutritional priorities. While some health experts take a cautious approach, offering broad, non-controversial recommendations, such as maintaining a healthy energy balance, follow a Mediterranean diet, and prioritize physical activity, a more precise and scientific approach is required to fully address the complexities of metabolic health and insulin resistance.\n\n**The Toxic Food Hypothesis**\n\nOver the past century, rates of obesity, insulin resistance, and Metabolic Syndrome have risen dramatically, largely due to fundamental changes in the food system.^(39,40) The transition from naturally occurring whole foods to a diet dominated by highly processed products now accounts for nearly 60% of total calorie intake in the United States.^(41) Despite growing evidence linking highly processed foods to poor metabolic health, mainstream nutrition guidelines continue to emphasize a “balanced diet” without adequately addressing the unique harms of these foods. The common recommendation to “*eat everything in moderation*” fails to acknowledge that some foods are inherently detrimental to human health. Rather than moderation, a more effective approach is to **minimize or eliminate the regular consumption of highly processed foods**.\n\nThe **Toxic Food Hypothesis** proposes that highly processed foods disproportionately contribute to insulin resistance through two primary mechanisms:\n\n1. **Overconsumption**: Processed foods promote excessive calorie intake compared to whole foods.^(42)\n2. **Metabolic Dysfunction**: Even at equal caloric intake, highly processed foods uniquely damage metabolic health.^(43)\n\nThe Toxic Food Hypothesis challenges the conventional calorie-centric model, emphasizing that food quality, not just quantity, is critical for metabolic health. Addressing insulin resistance requires more than simply adding healthier foods, it necessitates a fundamental shift away from highly processed foods.\n\n**Defining Highly Processed Foods**\n\nA common critique of the Toxic Food Hypothesis is the difficulty of defining “*highly processed foods.*” While classification systems like NOVA’s “ultra-processed foods” exist, there are several notable limitations and shortcomings. Given the vast diversity and complexity of the modern food supply, rigid definitions are impractical. A typical grocery store carries more than 30,000 food products, for example.  Instead, a more useful approach is to consider processed foods qualitatively along a spectrum:\n\n**Naturally Occurring → Minimally Processed → Highly Processed → Ultra-Processed**\n\nFor this discussion, **highly processed foods refer to products that cannot be made at home using simple ingredients and basic food preparation techniques**. Importantly, cooking is not the same as industrial food processing. Unlike household food preparation techniques (e.g., chopping vegetables, heating food, grinding peanuts to make peanut butter), industrial food processing involves chemical modifications and additives that fundamentally alter food composition. While not all processed foods are harmful, many contribute to poor metabolic health.\n\n**Strategies for Optimizing Food and Nutrition**:\n\n1. **Minimize or Eliminate Added and Refined Sugars**: A deliberate avoidance of highly processed foods, including highly processed sugars and carbohydrates, likely represents the greatest health opportunity for the majority of individuals with insulin resistance. To optimize health, individuals should aim to reduce or avoid added sugars found in sweets, candy, sodas, energy drinks, flavored coffee drinks, and sugar-containing condiments. Sugars contained in fruit juices should also be avoided, even if “all natural” or “organic.” Additionally, highly refined carbohydrates containing sugar should be avoided, including pastries, muffins, breakfast cereals, and many processed snack-foods. Among those with insulin resistance, restricting added and refined sugar to less than 15 grams per day is a reasonable goal. \n2. **Improve Carbohydrate Quality**: Significant health improvements can be made by focusing on the quality of the calories we consume. Research has shown that simply replacing high-fructose corn syrup with an equal amount of calories from starch-based carbohydrates can lead to noticeable improvements in insulin resistance, blood pressure, body weight, inflammation, and LDL cholesterol (Figure 3).^(43) These benefits were observed within just two weeks, without any reduction in total calorie or carbohydrate intake. Instead, the key change was a deliberate shift toward higher-quality carbohydrates and the elimination of added and refined sugars. Practical Examples to Improve Carbohydrate Quality:\n   * Replace **soda** **→ flavored sparkling water**.\n   * Replace **pasta**, **sandwiches**, and **grains** **→** **salad**; **eat more salad**!\n   * Replace **french fries** and **onion rings** **→** **sautéed** or **grilled vegetables**.\n   * Replace **white rice** **→** **riced cauliflower**, **whole grains**, or **legumes**.\n   * Replace **chips** **→** **mixed nuts**, **carrots and almond butter**, or **sliced peppers and hummus**.\n   * Replace **granola** **→** **mixed nuts with cinnamon**.\n   * Replace a **sugar-containing dessert** **→** **mixed fruit**. Note: Be mindful of the sugar content in common fruits; those with insulin resistance should preferentially select fruits with low sugar content (Table 5).^(44)\n\n**Figure 3. Stepwise Approach to Improving Carbohydrate Quality**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eef77jq9j1se1.png?width=2290&format=png&auto=webp&s=1224af90145b1247ea443c91776d87a294201be6\n\n1. **Advanced Analysis of Carbohydrate Quality**: To better understand carbohydrate quality, several advanced nutritional metrics can offer valuable insight. Key among these are the **Insulin Index** and **Glycemic Load** (not the Glycemic Index), both of which are particularly useful in assessing food choices for individuals with insulin resistance (Table 4). Choosing foods that are low in both Glycemic Load and Insulin Index can lead to significant improvements in insulin sensitivity. ^(45-48) In addition, other useful metrics include the **Percent Fiber of Total Carbohydrate** and the **Protein-to-Carbohydrate Ratio** (Table 4). While daily monitoring of these metrics is not necessary, they serve as useful reference points to scientifically evaluate food choices, illustrating a clear pattern from naturally occurring to highly processed foods, as shown in Table 4. While the **Glycemic Index** is widely understood and commonly used, it is less reliable for daily dietary decisions. Research suggests that alternative methods like Glycemic Load offer more consistent outcomes regarding the improvement of insulin resistance.^(49)\n\n**Table 4. Advanced Analysis of Carbohydrate Quality per 100 grams (Abbreviated Version)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ad0yllc4j1se1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd01aee3fbd356852cc18beed2f73577d8d59171\n\nNote: Definitions of the above terms and measurements are discussed in Table 11. Values are approximate estimates from a variety of online sources including [Food Struct](https://foodstruct.com/insulin-index-chart-food-list).\n\n**Table 5. Sugar content of common fruits.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ktx20qj5j1se1.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=991ea4f3c99e12f214c8fbc1509b061b62e315e5\n\nNote: This article is not meant to demonize fruit. However, clinical research has demonstrated that increasing fruit intake, without making other dietary changes, can worsen insulin resistance, blood sugar control, and liver inflammation, in individuals with poor metabolic health at baseline.^(44)\n\n1. **Reduce Total Carbohydrate Intake**: In addition to improving the quality of carbohydrates consumed, reducing total carbohydrate intake is often necessary for individuals with advanced insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. Well-designed clinical trials have shown that carbohydrate restriction is an effective strategy for improving insulin resistance.^(50-54) Because highly processed foods are disproportionately composed of highly refined carbohydrates, most studies evaluating “Carbohydrate Restriction” or “Low-Carbohydrate Diets” are indirectly evaluating the impact of restricting highly processed foods. Although reducing saturated fat is commonly recommended for lowering ApoB and LDL-C levels, it does not meaningfully improve insulin resistance.^(17) In randomized clinical trials, Carbohydrate Restriction and the Mediterranean Diet often outperform Low-Fat Diets.^(50,55) When compared directly, Carbohydrate Restriction may be equal to or even more effective than the Mediterranean Diet.^(50,56-58) Importantly, the Mediterranean Diet shares several key components with many forms of Carbohydrate Restricted Diets, including (1) increased intake of dietary fats from natural sources like mixed nuts and olive oil, (2) reduced consumption of highly refined carbohydrates, and (3) greater focus on whole grains and legumes. How closely an individual adheres to carbohydrate restriction depends on their unique circumstances and healthcare goals. For those with insulin resistance, it is important to discuss with a licensed healthcare professional to determine safe and appropriate targets. A common strategy is to reduce total carbohydrate intake by about 20-30%. For context, the average American adult consumes at least 240 grams of carbohydrates per day, with adult males averaging 260 to 300 grams per day.^(59-60) Additionally, the intake of added and refined sugars should be limited to less than 10 to 15 grams per day. Research by Christopher Gardner, Ph.D., and colleagues has shown that significant improvements in insulin resistance can be achieved with a total carbohydrate intake of less than 140 grams per day, with additional benefits from further restriction (Table 6).^(61) However, the quality of carbohydrates remains the most important factor, with a focus on minimizing or eliminating added sugars, refined sugars, and highly processed carbohydrate-rich foods. This article is not intended to advocate for a single approach, but rather, to emphasize the importance of avoiding highly processed foods, especially added and refined carbohydrates, which disproportionately contribute to insulin resistance.\n\n**Table 6. Impact of Carbohydrate Intake on Biomarkers of Insulin Resistance in the A to Z Trial\\*\\*\\*\\*****^(61)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kq37v27j1se1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=15e9b12f2d6bcb233da202337c414305d2c63499\n\n1. **Consider Time-Restricted Eating**: Both calorie restriction and time-restricted eating can improve insulin resistance, but emerging evidence suggests that time-restricted eating may offer distinct advantages. Some studies have demonstrated that time-restricted eating alone can result in an improvement in insulin sensitivity, pancreatic beta-cell function, and metabolic health, even without a reduction in calorie intake.^(62) Other clinical trials have achieved improvements in metabolic health utilizing time restricted eating, particularly when meals are consumed earlier in the day, aligning with circadian rhythms.^(63) Importantly, the evidence remains mixed and more research is needed to confirm whether or not there are unique benefits of time-restricted eating over calorie restriction.^(64,65) In theory, at a cellular level, a prolonged duration of fasting will promote greater improvements and recovery of insulin resistance when no calories are being consumed and no insulin is being secreted. In contrast, caloric restriction continues to stimulate insulin secretion, even when calorie intake is reduced. Therefore, as we await additional scientific research, it remains plausible that time-restricted eating may offer unique benefits for the sake of improving insulin resistance. Meanwhile, caloric restriction and time-restricted eating are both effective strategies for improving insulin resistance.\n2. **Track Glucose Levels Continuously**: Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) provide real-time feedback regarding glucose fluctuations in response to food intake, physical activity, stress, sleep, and medications. By offering instant, visual feedback, CGMs provide personalized data that can help to influence positive lifestyle changes. For example, if a particular food causes a glucose spike, choosing an alternative food or reducing the portion size may help to improve insulin resistance. This is particularly helpful and relevant to those **with** insulin resistance, where real-time, day-to-day feedback of food choices and the resultant blood glucose control can help to inform and modify daily decision making.  Meanwhile, in individuals **without** insulin resistance, the role of CGMs remains less clear due to the lack of reproducibility and consistency in CGM reported blood glucose values.^(66) Furthermore, glucose spikes to 140 to 150 mg/dL are normal and should not necessarily cause alarm and anxiety. Recent scientific research has acknowledged the reality that CGMs can overestimate the prandial glucose response when compared to capillary finger sampling.^(67) Given that lack of clear thresholds, issues with reproducibility, and issues with accuracy, CGMs should not be used to diagnose insulin resistance, but should instead provide insight into those with blood glucose dysregulation and the need to further evaluate the possibility of insulin resistance.\n\n**Balancing ApoB, Insulin Resistance, and Individual Circumstances**\n\nReductions in carbohydrate intake often leads to an increased consumption of dietary fats, including saturated fats. While the degree of carbohydrate processing significantly influences health, the same applies to dietary fats, where the source and composition matter. Importantly, higher saturated fat intake can elevate ApoB levels,^(68) however, this effect varies considerably^(69) depending on the type and quality of saturated fat consumed,^(70) as well as individual biological and genetic factors. Given these complexities, individuals making dietary changes should monitor blood work, including ApoB, to assess their individual response. For those looking to optimize ApoB levels or mitigate potential increases associated with carbohydrate restriction, several dietary strategies can be considered:\n\n1. **Increase Fiber Intake:** Increasing fiber intake, particularly **soluble fiber**, is an effective strategy for lowering LDL-C and ApoB. Soluble fiber found in foods such as psyllium, oats, barley, beans, and lentils, binds to bile acids and cholesterol, reducing absorption and increasing excretion, which in turn leads to greater LDL-C clearance and reduced ApoB levels. Clinical studies suggest that consuming 10 grams of soluble fiber per day can lower LDL-C by approximately 10 mg/dL.^(71,72) **Insoluble fiber**, found in wheat bran, whole grains, nuts, and vegetables, has also been shown to lower LDL-C and ApoB by increasing fecal bulk and reducing intestinal transit time. While its effects on ApoB are less pronounced than those of soluble fiber, it is another strategy for lowering ApoB.^(73,74)\n2. **Limit Consumption of Saturated Fat From Highly Processed Foods**: Saturated fats from highly processed foods can raise ApoB levels. These include processed meats, processed cheese products (e.g., American cheese, cheese spreads), many ready-to-eat and frozen meals, packaged snacks, certain baked goods, and fast food restaurants. Reducing intake of industrially manufactured and processed foods is a reasonable strategy for optimizing saturated fat intake and ApoB levels. \n3. **Replace Butter and Coconut Oil with Avocado Oil**: When cooking, replacing butter or coconut oil with avocado oil reduces saturated fat intake while avoiding reliance on highly processed oils like canola or soybean oil. Avocado oil is predominantly composed of monounsaturated fats, which are associated with favorable lipid profiles and remains stable at high cooking temperatures. \n4. **Limit Consumption of Industrial Raised Livestock**: Industrial-raised, grain-fed livestock have a less favorable fatty acid profile than grass-fed livestock. Grass-fed beef and dairy, for example, contain 2–5 times higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids, a higher proportion of stearic acid (which has a neutral effect on LDL-C and ApoB), and greater levels of antioxidants compared to grain-fed livestock.^(75,76) Preferentially selecting high-quality, naturally raised animal products is another approach to improving the quality and composition of dietary fat consumed.\n5. **Consider Select Plant-Based Meat Alternative Products**: Some plant-based meat alternatives, such as tofu and tempeh, are minimally processed and provide beneficial metabolic effects. However, newer plant-based substitutes vary widely in ingredient quality and processing methods. While some use whole-food ingredients and natural seasonings, others contain industrially processed components similar to traditional processed foods. Some studies suggest that plant-based meat alternatives may contribute to favorable metabolic health outcomes, including improvements in insulin resistance and reductions in LDL-C.^(77,78) However, not all studies have demonstrated improvements in LDL-C,^(79) and the impact on ApoB remains less well studied. When incorporating these products, selecting options with minimal additives and a whole-food-based ingredient list is preferable. \n\n**Aerobic Exercise and Strength Training**\n\nReddit character limit reached.

        "body": "This is fantastic, and aligns with my understanding perfectly.\n\nIf I could offer you one further bit of information to dig into - please look into excess Fructose metabolism.  Metabolized through fructokinase, ATP is both rapidly consumed and reduced long term by influencing its biogenesis.  \n\nThrough fructokinase, ATP is deteriorated into uric acid (ATP>ADP>AMP>Uric acid), which causes mitochondrial stress, reducing ATP biogenesis.  In turn, low energy cells signal an alarm - triggering cravings by modulating leptin and ghrelin.  This amounts to a feedback loop of overconsumption and further mitochondrial harm.  Thus, this process seems to directly cause insulin resistance, not primarily by buildup of fuel, but by crushing the efficiency by which the fuel is used.\n\nThis suggests a primary cause of insulin resistance, primarily through added sugars (sucrose), but the story gets much more interesting once we understand the many ways the body converts high blood glucose into Fructose.  This eventually unifies many hypotheses on weight gain.\n\nHere is an article that deep dives into this, via a number of different lines of evidence.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@christophermearns/the-fructose-reckoning-0b4b99360fb7",

Soybean oil in the 1990s became a major source of American calories, and high-fructose corn syrup is everywhere. Our subsidy program is so backward that less than 2% of farm subsidies go to fruits and vegetables.”\n\nI’m sure it will spark interesting conversations.

    "body": "In this thread we will discuss recent developments in soybean law. This discussion will be insightful for practitioners and will (hopefully) not involve any allegations of racism.\n\nAs will be seen, the humble soybean crosses many areas of law. It is my submission that soybeans are integral to the continued development of the common law and should be afforded equivalent reverance.\n\nThe first case for discussion is Lewis v Lewis [2022] QSC 208. The case involved the disolution of a farming partnership that farmed, among other things, soybeans. While the dissolution itself was uncontentious, one of the partners made a counterclaim for unpaid wages pursuant to an oral contract of employment. This counterclaim suffered several defects including the counterclaimant failing to plead material facts and the operation of statutory limitations. Ultimately the case was decided on points unrelated to soybeans. There is a more recent case on a similar point, Walsh v KC & WL Brain Pty Ltd [2023] NSWDC 38, but this case is from NSW and can therefore be disregarded.\n\nThe second case is Lin v Max Bean Pty Ltd [2021] FWC 6268 which was a general protections application relating to an alleged unfair dismissal. The employer/respondent was a soybean manufacturer. Paragraph [6] of the decision gives valuable insight into the employee's involvement with the soybeans. The employee was dismissed for his failure to come to work and attend the soybeans. Commissioner Platt held that communications between the parties objectively indicated that the applicant had been dismissed and ordered a certificate under s 368(3)(a) Fair Work Act be issued.\n\nThere are also many recent soybean focused IP decisions, showing the utility of the mighty soybean. I propose to only focus on Boehringer v Intervet [2020] FCA 1333 as it has the greatest focus on soybeans as a matter of law for patents. The case considered an erroneous challenge to a patent application alleging the addition of soybean oil to a formula did not meet the criteria of novelty or uniqueness to constitute an inventive step under the Patents Act. This was wrong and thr applicant copped a costs order for daring to suggest soybeans are not novel or unique.\n\nSoybeans have also been at the heart of epic property law battles. Re Browne [2018] QSC 297 concerned the transmission of freehold land used to farm soybeans upon the proprietors death. The case invovled a sibling rivalry and the mysterious disappearance of the original proprietor between 1898 and 1900. Another property epic is Ord Irrigation Co-operative Ltd v Dept of Water and Environmental Regulation [2020] WASAT 68. Poor Ord just want a water license to properly irrigate their soybean crops, but the fatcats at the Dept won't let them have it. Where is Christian Porter when you need to sock it to the government?!\n\nFinally, we come to family law. In Arranzio v Moss [2015] FAMCA 544, one of the elements considered by Judge Hogan in determining parenting/custody arrangements was the diet of the child. The mother wanted to feed the child a varied diet including meats, fruits, vegetables and legumes. To demonstrate the appropriateness of such a diet, the mother led evidence form a paediatrician that the child was not in fact allergic to soybeans, among other foods.",

        "body": "Come now, Rhybrah, surely you can't expect the soybean layman to absorb that without context. Let's back up a little.\n\nIn the 1960s, the first legal disputes related to soybeans in Australia emerged, primarily concerning intellectual property rights. In 1967, the Australian Patent Act was amended to allow for the patenting of microorganisms, including genetically modified organisms (GMOs) such as genetically modified soybeans. This led to a number of patent disputes related to soybeans, particularly in the area of genetically modified soybeans and their use in agriculture.\n\nOne notable case involving soybeans in Australia is the landmark legal dispute between Monsanto Technology LLC and farmer Steve Marsh in 2014. Marsh, an organic farmer from Western Australia, claimed that his organic certification was compromised when his fields were contaminated by neighboring farms growing genetically modified Roundup Ready canola, which is a genetically modified variety of canola that is resistant to the herbicide glyphosate. Marsh sued Monsanto for damages, alleging negligence and nuisance. The case garnered significant attention and raised legal and ethical questions regarding the coexistence of genetically modified and organic crops, and the responsibilities of farmers and seed suppliers in preventing cross-contamination.\n\nAnother notable case involving soybeans in Australia is the 2018 case of Branhaven LLC v. BP Australia Pty Ltd & Anor. This case involved a dispute over the patentability and infringement of a genetically modified soybean variety developed by Branhaven LLC, a US-based biotechnology company. The case raised questions about the patentability of genetically modified organisms and the scope of patent protection for plant varieties in Australia.\n\nIn addition to legal disputes, the cultivation and use of soybeans in Australia have also been regulated by various environmental and agricultural laws. For example, the Australian Gene Technology Act of 2000 regulates the release and use of genetically modified organisms, including genetically modified soybeans, to ensure their safe handling and environmental impact. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority also regulates the use of pesticides and herbicides in soybean cultivation to protect human health and the environment.\n\nOverall, the history of soybeans in Australia has been shaped by a combination of legal disputes, intellectual property rights, environmental regulations, and agricultural practices. The cultivation and use of soybeans in Australia continue to evolve, with ongoing debates and legal challenges related to GMOs, intellectual property, and environmental concerns shaping the landscape of soybean production in the country.",

But I've learned a few things that changed my mind about protein powders overall AND also the perceived need to constantly be full all the time. I really don't want to go into specific details because and write an essay of a response. But here are some things worth looking into.\n1. Protein powders from cows are stripped of their beneficial properties during the process of making them. Sure you get protein into your body but you wont be able to digest these proteins as much because of the lack of necessary enzymes (lactase). Mixing it with milk doesn't help counter this unless its raw/unpasteurized which is hard to come by (supermarkets dont have the option to buy this where I live and farmers markets also \"lightly pasteurize\" their product)\n2. Full of ingredients that aren't helping your gut \n3. The vegan protein powders aren't any better. I gained 20-30kgs in fat thinking that I was choosing the better option.\n4. Makes you fart a lot\n5.Fkn expensive for very little result\n6. Fasting through the day (not all the time) isn't going to kill you. On the contrary, it has several benefits. \n\nNow to offer a solution. Cook something before you leave home and eat it on the road (or whatever you're doing). I used to think this wasn't an option (I like my cooked food to be hot as we all do,) so I'd just buy a protein bar or shake. But it isn't bad after trying it. Eggs are great if you want a quick protein hit. Fried, scrambled, soft-boiled, omlette, whatever. And it keeps me full until I get home and can eat a more substantial meal.",

Steak and barbacoa (beef), 2 carbs per serving. \n\nSo nothing too outrageous, and we're still pretty damn keto friendly as far as I'm concerned - just figured the more hardcore keto-ers out there would appreciate the info :)",

There was a really nice cute girl who started working there back in the fall. We chatted a few times and I tried to work up the nerve to ask her out but I didn't have the balls. I would see her most times I went there to eat, and slowly over time she started getting larger. Then one day a few weeks back I went in and I recognized her, but I also didn't recognize her. She looked like a much larger version of herself had eaten her old self. She was not only seemingly twice her original size but she looked very sad and tired. \nClearly she must have had some bigger stuff going on but I guess free chipotle every day can take a toll if you're not doing keto",
