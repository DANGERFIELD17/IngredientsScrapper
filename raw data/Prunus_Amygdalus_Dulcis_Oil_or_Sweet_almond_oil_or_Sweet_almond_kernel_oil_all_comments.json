    "body": "O. M. G.   I literally cannot stop feeling myself up because my skin is SO SOFT.\n\nApparently TONS of you slather yourselves in body oil or lotion after a shower and have always done that.  (After finding out about this, I did some reddit research and I see all the posts about body oil.)  I never learned  to do this and just  w  o  w.  This is such a game changer.\n\nI'm obsessed now and can't stop wanting to try different oils.\n\nSo far I've tried:\n\n1. Plain old Johnson and Johnson baby oil - I liked this, but still felt a little oily. Also I read something on here about how mineral oil isn't the best.\n2. Neutrogena Light Sesame Oil - I loved the texture of this, but didn't love the scent.  The scent is lovely, it's just not me. I tend to wear vanilla or bright floral, citrus, clean scents and this is a little deeper and muskier.\n3. Aveeno Daily Body Oil Mist with Oat and Jojaba oil - Loved the scent of this but hated the misting bottle.  I'll try it in a different bottle and see if it's better.  Texture was great.\n4. Palmers Skin Therapy - Favorite so far.  Love the scent.  Love the texture.  It soaks in and feels increeedddible.  Love that it has vitamin e.  Only dislike is the shape of the bottle - it's a little hard to squirt when I'm all slippery and oily in the shower.  I'm getting a different bottle to make it easier.\n\nOnes I want to try:\n\n1. Jojaba oil\n2. Sweet almond oil\n3. Vitamin e oil\n4. Osea body oil  (eek! that price!)\n\nMy process - Shower like normal.  Shut off the water and pin up my hair with a clip.  Stay in the shower and slather oil on wet skin (no drying off beforehand).  Once oiled e v e r y w h e r e, step out and rub the oil in until mostly no longer wet.  I usually don't even need a towel after this - my skin just soaks it up.\n\nFor reference, I'm a pasty freckled girl with redish hair and permanently dry skin.  If you are also a pasty white person and did not grow up slathering yourself in oil after a shower, I STRONGLY recommend you try it.  Thank you to all of you who posted suggestions on body oil in past threads.  Super helpful.  Love ya'll!",

I still struggle with breakage on my end and those fairy knots but overall my hair had grown and is easier to manage when I use this. \n\nIngredients:\nOne can of unsweetened coconut milk (don’t shake)\nSweet almond oil\nGrape seed oil \nBlack castor oil\nVegetable glycerin \nAloe gel\n\nI only use the “fat” in the coconut milk and not the water. If not shaken it should be separated. I measure everything else by heart but don’t over do the oil too much. I usually put this in my hair and leave it for 45 minutes. I do no oiling after this in my hair routine because this will leave your hair pretty oily as is. It works for me and I hope this also works for you. :) ",

Lots of leather has dyes added and cleaning chemicals can remove that dye with the oil and leave you with a dark oil spot with a lighter colored ring around it. \n\nThey make an oil remover for leather that is sprayed on and it foams. As it foams it pulls the oil out. It’s safest if you use it on the back side of the leather but that involves upholstery work.\n\nThis is all if it’s true suede…if it’s fake suede or ultra suede call a professional and they can most likely get it cleaned up. No guarantee though, ultra suede is basically microfiber which is a super absorbent material and strong oils can bond with it and become problematic.\n\nSource: I’ve been a fabric and floor cleaner for over 20 years",

I infuse it into an oil as a butter would be too heavy for my hair(fine strands) and using it as a mask seems messy. I apply the oil after my first leave in conditioner on wash days, then I reapply another leave in after the oil. I also scrunch the oil into my ends every night after the 3rd night since wash day. Oh and I mixed the powder into my deep conditioner! I noticed that not only am I retaining length easier but my hair also seems denser than it was previously. I can't wait to see what my hair would look like in 6 months. So please please please give chebe powder a try you guys and see if you can incorporate it into your routine daily somehow.

It always gets worse if my legs have been rubbing together a lot, like when wearing skirts in the summer. \n\nGlycolic acid 5 to 8%, avoiding sensitive bits like the vulva, works really well for lightening it up. Then after waiting 10 minutes or so, I just rub a lot of oil in that area. Oil the whole baby up. I use sweet almond oil but any oil that penetrate the skin well and doesn't dry up super quick works. \n\nI usually use the glycolic acid it every day for a week or two. Afterwards I will only use the oil. Then I'll use glycolic acid every once in a while like once a month or 2 months depending on how bad it's come back. But I find this routine works really well for me and it's pretty low maintenance. It doesn't clear it up 100%, but it reduces it so much and I haven't seen that area look this pretty in many years. Hope that helps you all\n\nEdit: I'm being downvoted, is this the wrong sub? Didn't mean to offend anyone just sharing something that worked for me..",

I reacted badly to almost every product | tried, either directly after applying or it would make me break out after 1-2 days. I wasted so much money on skincare items but at least it wasn't for nothing because I finally have a routine that my skin loves! :)\n\nStep one: Avene xeracalm oil cleanser\n\nStep two: Isana ultra sensitive calming serum\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Polyglycery -6 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Coco-Caprylate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Oenothera Biennis Oil, Panthenol, Ethylhexy|glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Pantolactone\n\nRight now it's still hot where I live so it's hydrating enough but when it gets colder I use vaseline at night to look in the moisture.\n\nI also use tea tree oil as spot treatment for pimpler & Salicylic acid to exfoliate when I can tell mys v needs it (less than once a week, even that was tu-much for my sensitive skin, it caused break outs)\n\nI do also use sunscreen but I haven't found the right one yet.

    "body": "The other day, I was down another rabbit hole of Careprost for lashes and found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ky9ece/24_days_progress_rosemary_and_peppermint_oil_and/gjfaxsy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) very useful comment on r/HaircareScience\n\nTl;DR: Key points-\n\n1. Rosemary oil is as effective as minoxidil for hair growth\n2. Castor oil as a carrier oil for all packs due to it's anti-fungal, conditioning & growth boosting properties\n3. Other oils & ingredients to be added as per concern\n\n\\[Crosspost\\]Several years ago, after reading up a lot on Rosemary Oil and finding it is a common ingredient in many regrowth serums, I have been using it with a variation of Castor Oil hair masks, some also with Peppermint Oil. I've been using my masks for roughly 4 years now and my hair is completely different and no longer concerns me.\n\nI have shared this a few times elsewhere so copy and pasting the relevant parts (after a lot, a lot of research), where brows and lashes were more the focus; I use only pure Castor Oil on my lashes and the other hair mask mixtures on my brows. Also I was using a hair mask weekly to every 10 days for the first 2 years or so, then 3 times a month for roughly a year, and now (coming up on 2 years) I use one every 2-3 weeks.\n\nWarning **LONG** post.\n\nI combine the mixture into two 30ml or one 60ml dropper bottles (ratios dependent on hair length) since it can be mixed/shaken well and I find it to be the easiest/least messy way to apply it in sections (I also warm the bottle(s) in a mug of hot tap water for about 5-7 minutes prior for the hot oil effect), starting at the roots and moving my way down to the tips. I always massage it into my scalp for a good 10+ minutes once done, I use a gentle, non-stripping shampoo and wash twice to get it all out/prevent weighing it down. (I aim to use it where I don't need to style my hair the following day to give it a break and honestly it's too soft to hold most styles I've found and just leave it with only a bit of leave-in conditioner). I buy a pack of [100 disposable shower caps](http://imgur.com/a/bm3CO8c) from Amazon for around $3-$5 too to make using the masks really easy. I'll use one of the below masks...\n\n**• Castor Oil & Aloe Vera Hair Mask**\n\n*For a nourished and healthy scalp, conditions hair, adds shine and strength and promotes growth. I use 70% Castor Oil and 30% Aloe (I prefer Lily of the Desert) and ideally left overnight but I aim for a minimum 2 hours, I use a disposable shower cap. It's a very gentle and soothing mask. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Fractioned Coconut Oil Hair Mask**\n\n*Ideal for thin (thinning) hair, to get healthier, thicker and stronger hair, also promotes growth. I mix 60:40 oils and leave on for 45 minutes to an hour, wrapped in a hot/warm towel. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil, Egg & Honey Mask**\n\n*For split ends, damaged and unruly hair; promotes growth, nourishes and tames, also helps with an irritated scalp; it's very deep conditioning. I use 1 egg, 8 tablespoons of castor oil, and 2 tablespoon of honey (I warm the honey slightly to mix it in easier). Leaving it on for approximately an hour, wrapped with a shower cap and a hot/warm towel over top. Note: Once honey is mixed, it is not the sticky mess you would anticipate and it's not at all difficult to wash away either.*\n\n***Re: Eggs***\n\n>*\"For normal hair use the entire egg to condition, use egg whites only to treat oily hair; use egg yolks only to moisturize dry brittle hair.\"*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Sweet Almond Oil Hair Mask**\n\n*Perfect for thin and/or lifeless hair, again promotes growth and is a deeply nourishing mask and adds bounce. I use a 60% and 40% ratio. Best left on overnight wrapped initially with a hot/warm towel for an hour and then with a disposable shower cap if leaving on overnight. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Water Hair Mask**\n\n*This one is easiest to make obviously and comes with the same benefits of thick, shiny and strong hair, along with regrowth. I use approximately 10+ tablespoons oil and 2-3 tablespoons of water to thin it and help it spread easier. Leaving it on for two hours minimum, overnight is great too from my experience. (Rosemary Oil optional...I sometimes add in Peppermint Oil as well which also stimulates follicles.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Argan Oil Hair Mask**\n\n*This mask is highly moisturizing, helps strengthen strands, less breakage and less fallout will be noticed, promotes hair growth, bounce and shine and is nourishing for the scalp. I use a 50:50 ratio and leave it on anywhere from 1 hour (with a hot towel) to overnight (with a shower cap). (Rosemary and Peppermint Oil optional, I personally always add both to this mask.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Ylang Ylang Mask**\n\n*\"This mask is an effective natural treatment to reduce hair fall out caused by stress and alopecia. When it is massaged into the hair follicles, it stimulates hair growth and is a natural way to treat thinning hair according to studies.\" I mix a 70:30 ratio and leave it on for an hour, wrapped in a warm towel. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\nWhere I've said **\"Rosemary Oil Optional\"**, I do add it in, (often with Peppermint Oil as well), after finding it's either a very common ingredient (as is Castor Oil) or performs similarly to hair regrowth serums (I'll generally add in 10-15 drops based on my ratios (or roughly 8 and 8 drops if adding in both Peppermint and Rosemary Oils...**if unfamiliar or new to EOs, I highly recommend a patch test that is mixed with a carrier oil and only a couple of drops added**): \n\n>*\"If you want to improve both hair thickness and hair growth, rosemary oil is a great choice thanks to its ability to improve cellular generation. According to studies, rosemary oil performed as well as minoxidil, a common hair growth treatment, but with less to no scalp itching as a side effect.\"*\n\n***Note re:*** *oil substitutions, in place of Sweet Almond, Fractioned Coconut, Ylang Ylang or Argan Oils (or perfectly fine added in/combined if preferred), Sesame, Grapeseed, Avocado and/or Jojoba Oils have all shown similar hair and scalp health benefits. I'll mix and match whatever I have on hand or if out of one of them but Castor Oil is always the main base.*\n\n**Castor oil’s antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal properties make it an effective treatment for scalp infections, dandruff and/or irritations including dry or oily scalp. Also it's strengthening, shine boosting, conditioning and promoting of hair growth, it dramatically improves fallout too from my experience and is usually one of the main ingredients in hair regrowth systems/serums. Although I have tried and liked many,** [**this Castor Oil**](http://imgur.com/a/uU4qvGY) **is my favourite one that I always go back to and have now solely used for the last 2 years.**\n\nLastly: For realistic expectations since I know many who tried it for a few weeks to a month and didn't see results fast enough and/or weren't consistent; I've been using castor oil for hair, brows and lashes for around 4 years now. After a couple of weeks, everything simply looked healthier with added shine. After 1 month I started seeing baby hairs growing in where there weren't any previously, my hair stopped falling out at such a high rate, often I would brush my hair and be really surprised to see maybe 2 strands in the brush vs a huge handful, it was also feeling stronger and had a lot of body, lashes looked lengthened and brows looked mildly fuller. At 3 months my hair was definitely thicker and stopped falling out completely, other than normal shedding. It was at the 6 month mark my hair had grown in length quite significantly, it was healthy, very strong, shiny, had bounce to it and was much, much thicker...my brows were full again and no sparse areas, lashes were longer and fuller as well. (I applied nightly to brows and lashes, I use [these tubes](http://imgur.com/a/pAOK2DC) from AliExpress, also available on Amazon for just a bit more, which were quite cheap.)\n\nI hope this helps! :)\n\nShoutout to u/therealmrsbrady for sharing her routine.",

I’m doing a big clean out and decided to also do a bunch of micro-reviews. They are very subjective, just my thoughts about my experience with a final verdict about whether or not I’d repurchase. Mostly face products, but threw in a couple body, make up, and hair items I have opinions about. Most surprising product is probably the Just For Men Beard Tint (spoiler: love). \n\nHere are a couple [pictures of all the stuff](https://imgur.com/a/5s8piDR) in the same categories as below, plus a current one of my skin. I put some info about my skin type below and my current tried and true routine. I’m pretty adamant about sticking to just one active at a time now (which makes my huge stash kind of hilarious), but I like to buy myself face products as a little treat, so this was a good reminder of some great things I’ve forgotten about and which are not worth the hype.\n\nAfter that, I made a list of all the products by category so you can quickly scan to see if there’s anything of interest to you. Reviews are under that in the same numbered order.\n\n**My face:**\n\n39 with very pale skin that’s prone to freckles and easily burns. On the sensitive side, dry, and loves as many moisturize and hydrating products as I can give it. Pregnancy (5+ years ago) was terrible for my skin. Tons of hormonal acne, very bumpy texture, and very prone to deep cystic pimples. (I’ve previously posted some before/afters in this sub.) It took me a couple years to get it under control, and now I am happier with my skin than I’ve ever been before. I started getting Botox/dysport about a year ago, every four months, for my forehead and glabella, which smoothed out the light lines and deep 11s I was developing. \n\n**My routine:**\n\nAM:\n\n* Light wash with cleanser in shower\n* Vitamin C serum\n* Moisturizer\n* SPF\n* Light makeup (bb cream, blush, setting powder, mascara)\n\nPM: \n\n* Take off eye makeup with micellar water\n* Double cleanse face\n* Spray under chin with hypochlorous acid (new addition)\n* 3 day cycle:\n   * Tretinoin\n   * Chemical exfoliant \n   * Deep hydration/slug night\n* Moisturizer\n* Beekman 1802 Milkshake\n* Rosehip Seed oil \n* Aquaphor if we’re slugging\n\n\n\nProduct List (not alphabetical or in any particular order, I had to draw the line somewhere…)\n\n**Cleansers**\n\n1.

I like having the stuff around. My eyes are sensitive, and it tolerates this best to take off mascara at the end of the day. Also, really great if you have a child who’s given make up for Christmas even though they’re too young and they use lipstick as a face paint stick. Hypothetically speaking. **Verdict:  a face care staple, will always repurchase, but not brand loyal.**\n\n1. **La roche-posay Toleriane**: great cleanser. My skin loves it, gets everything off, but doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped. I use it as the second step in a double cleanse or by itself in the morning. The big pump bottle is a huge plus, I like to buy it and not think about it for months. **Verdict: this is an automatic repurchase, love it.** \n\n1. **Naturium cleansing balm:** I always feel a little annoyed when I buy this (and I’ve gone through at least three). It works beautifully and melts off my eye makeup if I don’t use micellar water for that. This jar is like $18, though, and never lasts as long as I think it should. I used to do oil cleansing with caster oil and jojoba oil, which my skin loved, but honestly, it’s just a really unsexy experience. The bottles are never cute, you have to mix your own oil blend, it doesn’t really emulsify, so you need to use a washcloth. I’m a working mom, I just want a one stop shop these days (says the lady with the super complicated skincare routine. **Kocostar Princess Eyepatches** \n\n1. **Benefit Get Unblocked:** this came as a sample when I bought some new mascara. I love it, but I haven’t even looked up the price. I guarantee it’s probably going to be more $$$ than the Naturium. **Verdict: super nice for a double cleanse, I might splurge on a full-size.**\n\n1. **Tower 28 SOS Rescue Spray:** This isn’t exactly a cleanser, but I didn’t know where else to put it. This is a recent addition and a game changer. I am a face toucher. I rest on my chin during the day, I sleep with my hands under my chin at night. I really try to break the habit, but it’s hard. Also, one of the glorious indignities of motherhood was that I now grow thick hair under my chin. Waxing and threading are too irritating for my skin, and I spend too much money on shit like this to afford electrolysis, so I just give it a quick shave in the morning. Consequently, I’m prone to breakouts in this area. I got the spray on a whim, and it’s helped A LOT. But it seems wildly expensive for what it is. I have a bottle of Briotech on the way that folks seem to really like, so I’m excited to see if the cheap dupe continues these great results. **Verdict: I love it, I want it, but I hope the cheaper version works just as well.** \n\n\n\n**Toners**\n\n1. **Paula’s choice enriched calming toner**: I used the whole bottle, but didn’t notice a big difference. Honestly, it could’ve been water, and I haven’t missed not having it in my routine. **Verdict: won’t repurchase.**\n\n1. **Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Hyarulonic Toner**: I really like the consistency of this, it’s kind of thick and dries down nicely. It’s not a make or break for me. I use it on my hydration days, but not consistently. it kind of has the same effect on my skin as the Beekman spray, but the Beekman is better . **Verdict: I like it, and my skin likes it, might throw it into an order if I’m trying to meet a minimum for free shiping, but won’t go out of my way.**\n\n1. **Beekman 1802 Milkshake**: this is expensive, but after buying the trial size twice, I splurged for the big bottle. My face loves it. I basically can’t hydrate my skin enough, so I’ll layer this over lotion and then follow it with the Rose hip oil. It’s ridiculous. It also is excellent at setting makeup for a lightly dewy look over loose powder. Silly gripe, you really have to shake it hard to mix the oils, and if I’m not careful, the cap starts to twist off. I always check it before I use it after an unfortunate shaking mishap. **Verdict: This is a must have for me. I will keep buying even at this price point.**\n\n\n\n**Acids and Exfoliants**\n\n1. **Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**: I like this a lot. I use a chemical exfoliant every three days and kind of just assess that evening what my skin wants/needs. I probably opt for BHA one out of every three exfoliating days and glycolic the other two. I think that works out to using it about once every week and a half. It really helps keep my skin clear, and works best if I double cleanse, apply, and then wait about 30 minutes to put on moisturizer and other hydrating layers (sorry! That sounded unreasonable to me, too, at first, but it’s really the best way. I usually wash my face at 8pm and apply my layers throughout the rest of the evening). **Verdict: this stuff is great and my skin tolerates it really well. But I don’t love it so much that I’m brand loyal and will probably try another BHA when I finish this bottle. Likely to repurchase at some point, though.** \n\n1. **The Ordinary Acid Glycolic 7% Toning Solution**: Love this stuff. Tightens my skin in the best way possible. It’s also great for exfoliating my feet and other super dry skin. I haven’t used it under deodorant, but I totally should. I tend to use it on my face probably twice as much as I use BHA on my exfoliating days (but I only use one at a time). **Verdict: will always repurchase. It’s so cheap and so effective.** \n\n1. **Paula’s Choice 25% AHA + 2% Exfoliant Peel**: this was a free gift with a Paula’s Choice order. I use it occasionally on my exfoliation days, but probably less than once a month. Love the purple sparkle in the mask, but waiting around for 10 minutes to wash it off feels like an eternity to me. This kind of makes no sense because I do my skin care throughout the evening, letting each layer dry, but it’s more about not forgetting and leaving it on too long. **Verdict: I like it and eventually I’ll finish this tube. But I probably won’t go out of my way to repurchase.**\n\n1. **Malezia 2.6% Benzoyl Peroxide Gel**: When my skin was at its worst, this plus their urea cream were the only things that helped. It’s a very gentle and pretty hydrating formula. I use it mostly as a spot treatment now. **Verdict: the best BP I’ve ever tried (and I was a teenager in the 90s). I’m due to order another one.** \n\n\n\n**Serums and Actives**\n\n1. **Mad Hippie Vitamin C:** great serum. I picked this up locally if I’m out of vitamin C and don’t feel like getting something shipped. I like the thicker consistency of this formula, and it feels extra hydrating going into winter. **Verdict: I’ll keep it in rotation. My skin seems to respond best to swapping vitamin C oils when I finish a bottle.**\n\n1. **Maelove The Glowmaker:** another great vitamin C. I see a lot of benefits when I use it. The formula is very watery, so if I’m not careful, it will run down my forehead, and the last thing I want to do is get vitamin C in my eyes. It also starts out clear when I get it, but has oxidized a lot by the time I reached the end of the bottle, so it starts to lose efficacy if you take too long to finish (sign of a good, fresh, vitamin C product). **Verdict: another staple in my vitamin C rotation.**\n\n1. **Paula Choice vitamin C:** I don’t know why, but this one just doesn’t seem to work for me. I went through two full bottles, and didn’t see any of the brightening effects that I got within a week of swapping to Maelove. **Verdict: it has all the right stuff, but just not for me. Won’t repurchase.**\n\n1. **Derma E Vitamin C**: this was an impulse buy at Marshall’s. It’s more of a product with vitamin C. Not a true vitamin C serum and did not get any of the brightening effects, but it is a nice formula that added more hydration to my face. **Verdict: nothing negative, but nothing positive. Won’t repurchase.**\n\n1. **The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + zinc 1%**: this one is really subtle for me. When I’ve been consistent, I do notice some nice tightening effects. But it’s not a big payoff, and I don’t like using more than one serum at a time. **Verdict: not on my priority list. Probably won’t repurchase when I finish this bottle.**\n\n1. **The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5%:** this is a must have when I go on business trips. With a tiny amount, patted in, I can visibly see the puffiness going down around my eyes. Downside, is every so often my eyes start stinging when I use it, even though I try to be super careful. I don’t know what makes the difference. **Verdict: not  going to use every day and it will last me a very long time, but something I like having in my arsenal.** \n\n1. **The Ordinary Multipeptide + copper peptides 1%**: I’m not sure about this one. I know peptides are a long game, and my skin likes this formula. I use it every third day of my hydration day, but it’s hard for me to say if it’s actually effective. **Verdict: I’ll probably try another brand when I finish this bottle to see if I get more immediate effects, but it’s cheap enough that I’ll probably repurchase at some point down the line.** \n\n1. **The Ordinary Hyaluronic acid 2%**: love this stuff. I mostly use it on my lips at night after I brush my teeth when my lips are wet. I then layer lip balm on top, or I’ll layer it on my skin if it feels particularly dry. Even when products have hyaluronic acid in it, the standalone stuff really seems to work best. **Verdict: a staple, will continually repurchase.**\n\n1. **Purito centella green level buffet serum:** I don’t actually know it this stuff is supposed to do. Hydrate and calm I guess, but my skin is neutral to it at best and kind of felt irritated at worst. **Verdict: not going to purchase, not going to finish the bottle.**\n\n1. **Paula’s choice 1% retinol**: this stuff was pretty good, but I’ve moved onto the prescription level tretinoin, not going back. **Verdict: good for what it is, prescription is better, won’t repurchase.** \n\n1. **BYOMA brightening serum**: this is kind of just a hyaluronic acid in a cute bottle. Adds some moisture and feels, nothing special (honestly, maybe a good pick for a young kid who wants to get into skincare). **Verdict: liked it and used the bottle, won’t repurchase.**\n\n1. **Caudalie Resveratrol Lift**: this was a sample that a Sephora employee insisted I needed. I asked about a vitamin C serum, and they said this was proven to be more effective than vitamin C. I don’t know about that. Feels fine, don’t love the smell, and happy I don’t like it, because it’s expensive AF. **Verdict: glad I didn’t purchase and won’t.**\n\n1. **Retin-A cream .025% (prescription tretinoin)**: This stuff is great. Goes on beautifully and makes my skin feel like velvet. Made the hormonal cystic acne I’d get on my chin during my period each month a distant memory. It’s $60 a tube from my derm, but it did last me forever. See the next item about why I’ll wait to repurchase. **Verdict: love it. Magic in a tube.** \n\n1. **Tinitrend Tretinoina 0.05%**: my friend went to Mexico and bought me two tubes of Tretinoin over-the-counter for $30 for like 6x the volume than the one I got from my derm. The formula isn’t as elegant, it’s more of an ointment consistency and can get a little oily, but still very effective for me and keeps those cystic pimples at bay. I’ll use these up, which will probably take me a year, and then go back to my derm for more Retin-a. Or take a vacation to Mexico… **Verdict: Would definitely get more if I had the opportunity to re-purchase.** \n\n1. **Cicapair Tiger Grass**: what the fuck is this stuff and who is it for? I don’t think it’s categorized right and I do not care. it’s super thick, like Desitin, it goes on green, and then dries down to this sallow beige. They make it seem like it’s magically going to make your skin not red, but no matter how lightly I applied, it felt spackled on. I used it like three times, such a waste of money. **Verdict: hate it, won’t repurchase, regret that I did.** \n\n\n\n**Moisturizers**\n\n1. **Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin**: what a gorgeous moisturizer. I’m savoring this one. When I buy it, I order a couple tubes from Korea, which is much less expensive than the U.S. It has a beautiful finish. This is my daytime moisturizer and a little goes a long way. **Verdict: love this and will probably repurchase, even though it’s more expensive than the vanicream which also gets the job done.**\n\n1. **Vanicream for Sensitive Skin**: A workhorse. Great for my skin. Pretty affordable in the big pump bottle. It does have a white cast at first that goes that goes away pretty quickly.  **Verdict: a staple, will always have on hand.** \n\n1. **Malezia Urea Moisturizer**: This stuff is in.cred.i.ble. When my skin was awful, I was not kind to it. I washed it more. I would do aspirin + honey masks, which is basically a salicylic, and actually really nice if your skin is mostly happy. Mine was not. Turns out what I needed was way more moisture, hydration and to fix my damn moisture barrier. This was the only cream that really worked for me and started to turn this around. **Verdict: I’m over due to buy more. I don’t need it as critically as I did when I started my skincare journey, but I will always support this small, thoughtful company and excellent product.**  \n\n1. **Trader Joe’s Brazil Nut Body Butter \\[body product\\]**: I like it. It’s a good, thick, rich cream. I like using oils more, though, they work better for my skin. **Verdict: won’t run out to restock once I finish it up, but I’ll probably pick it up again down the line.** \n\n1. **Welly Daily Hydration body lotion \\[body product\\]:** surprisingly good–more hydrating than most similar big bottle lotions I’ve tried (you know what I mean?). It’s my nightstand lotion and a last line of defense for anything dry before bed. **Verdict: a staple, will continuously rebuy.**\n\n1. **Aquaphor healing ointment**: A nonnegotiable essential. I use it on my lips over balm every night, on my face to slug about once a week (even in the summer, more in the winter) and on my feet after I’ve exfoliated with glycolic acid and put on lotion when they’re especially dry. So good. **Verdict: a tube goes a long long way, but a must have I will always have on hand.** \n\n1. **Kocostar Princess Eyepatches**: honestly forgot I had these. Picked them up at World Market last year from the clearance shelf. I wanted the Peter Rolf ones, but couldn’t justify the cost. I used them this morning, and they’re nice! Do they do a lot? Not really. Add some moisture. But they’re a sparkly gold color and feel like cool, slick little baby seals snuggling on my face, so I feel fancy wearing them for a bit while I get ready. Try not to moisturize the skin you want them to stick to beforehand, they’ll slide right off your face like a kid going off the end of the slip ‘n slide. **Verdict: it’s taken me almost a year to go through half the jar (30 pairs), so not anytime soon, but I would get them again purely as a lil treat.** \n\n\n\n**Oils**\n\n1. **Brand 365 Rosehip Oil**: Skip the skin care section in Whole Foods and head over to the aromatherapy aisle. This organic carrier oil is amazing for my skin and super cheap. **Verdict: will repurchase constantly.**\n\n1. **Brand 365 Sweet Almond Oil \\[body product\\]:** Pretty cheap, works better for me than any lotion ever has. I put it on wet skin immediately after I shower, and I’m super soft all day. I wish it actually did smell like almonds, though. I love a marzipan so much, but this oil is unscented to me. **Verdict: a staple. Will continually repurchase.** \n\n1. **Oui the People Body Oil \\[body product\\]**: The smell of this oil is absolutely incredible. Maybe my favorite product scent ever. Functionally, it works the same as the almond oil but it’s so much more expensive, I can’t really justify it regularly. **Verdict: Will repurchase a small bottle eventually as a treat for special occasions**.\n\n\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\n1. **Isatree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF 50**: This is the best facial sunscreen I’ve ever used. I am very pale, I burn if I look at the sun the wrong way. I burn at the beach midday, even if I’ve religiously reapplied sunscreen. I had a couple sunburns so bad they blistered as a kid and am hypervigilant about sun protection as an adult. This stuff has a beautiful thin texture and I can easily put on two layers. No white cast, and it dries down to a glowy finish that doesn’t even need a little powder on a no-makeup day. **Verdict: cannot sing praises enough. I have to order it from Korea (and make the shipping worth it), so I’ve been putting off a re-order, but will get multiple bottles when I do.** \n\n1. **Supergoop Glow Screen SPF 40**: what even is this??? Accidentally bought a travel size when I meant to buy Unseen. If I put on enough for adequate coverage, I shimmer like I coated my face in cream bronze eyeshadow from 2002. Not cute. **Verdict: will not repurchase and will not finish the tiny tube I have.** \n\n1. **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40**: This is a really nice sunscreen with a super velvety finish. It’s also a great makeup primer. But it’s expensive and the Trader Joe’s dupe is almost as good (see below), so I can’t justify buying it. **Verdict: would use it in a heartbeat, but probably won’t rebuy because of cost.** \n\n1. **Supergoop Lip Screen Shine SPF 40**: I should use this more, and it looks nice on. But it has a kind of bitter chemical taste, and I just don’t like it. **Verdict: going to try to make myself finish the tube, but I won’t repurchase.** \n\n1. **Trader Joe’s Daily Facial Sunscreen SPF 40:** This sunscreen is pretty damn great. A very close dupe to Supergoop Unseen, and it’s very easy to pick up during my weekly grocery shop at TJ’s. I do find that sometimes you get a bottle with kind of a grainy texture, but it goes away as you rub it on (like it needs a little warmth to re-emulsify). And it will pill if you use an oil over it, so I save my oils for night. But overall, a solid pick for everyday use. **Verdict: a staple, I have a bunch stashed in all my travel and beach bags.** \n\n1. **Beekman 1802 Milk Primer SPF 30**: Eh. This was nice. My mom gave it to me as a Christmas gift (funny story, she’s conservative and thinks that 1802 means it’s some centuries old American farm. As her queer leftist daughter, I am delighted that it’s a pretty recent project from two gay men). It’s comparable to the Isatree (but not quite as nice). The packaging is beautiful and is definitely a luxury experience, but it’s so expensive and you get so little product. **Verdict: totally hope I get it again as a gift, but will not buy it for myself.**\n\n\n\n**BB creams**\n\n1. **Purito Cica Clearing BB Cream**: Amazing BB cream. With a little setting powder on top, my skin looks like velvet. Tried another brand I’m going to finish, but coming back to this one asap. **Verdict: best bb I’ve tried, probably going to be my staple. Another Korean skincare purchase, and I’m due to buy more.**\n\n1. **Skin79 BB Super+ Beblesh Balm**: This is a weird one. At first, I hated it, way too thick and looks like makeup instead of the enhanced skin look I’m going for. But a little goes a long way, and I’ve learned that if I dot on a small amount and blend it out, it’s pretty good. **Verdict: Not bad, but going to finish the bottle, won’t repurchase.** \n\n1. **Laura Mercier Natural Skin Perfector**: I really don’t like this one. Most expensive option I’ve tried and literally my least favorite. The texture is nice, but it oxidizes badly on me and makes me look like I have oily skin if I don’t set with powder, not dewy or luminous. **Verdict: Why is this so expensive, so bad, and so well reviewed? A mystery. Will not repurchase.** \n\n1. **Glossier skin tint:** I like a sheer tint, but this is too sheer for me. Not enough coverage and doesn’t seem to last. **Verdict: used the bottle, but won’t repurchase.** \n\n\n\n**Lip Balms**\n\n1. **Malin + Goetz Mojito Lip Balm**: This stuff is so good. So so good. My wife got it in a birthday gift and gave it to me. I didn’t use it for the longest time because it looked medicinal? The packaging is kind of weird. But then I did, and it’s the most amazing lip treatment ever. Stays on for hours. Beautiful shine. I’m using it day and night. **Verdict: must buy, wish it came in tints!**\n\n1. **Inkey List Tripeptide Plumping Lip Balm**: This was the first balm that really changed my lip game. Before this, I felt like I was always trying to fix dry lips, and they were never hydrated. For the best ever night treatment, I wet my lips, put on a couple drops of hyaluronic acid, put on this peptide balm, and then a thin coat of Aquaphor. The Malin + Goetz is a step up, and doesn’t need the Aquaphor, but this is still a staple I’ll have on hand, I’ve gone through many many tubes. **Verdict: always going to stock up on this one.**\n\n1. **Lanolips 101 Ointment:** This stuff is nice. Smells like peaches (and they have lots of scents) and is very moisturizing. They say you can use it anywhere, so I put it on a little dry patch under my nose recently. It really helped, and the smell was pleasant, not overwhelming. **Verdict: lip balms are fun little treats, and I have multiple in every bag I own. I’ll probably try others before getting more of this one, but it’s a very solid choice, and I’ll probably get another down the line.** \n\n1. **Burt’s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm**: A classic for a reason. Great to have on hand and I love the peppermint one the best. It’s not super hydrating necessarily (so not for deeply dry lips), but very emollient and protective, great to keep the effects of an overnight lip treatment going on a crisp winter day. **Verdict: a staple (though I don’t seem to buy them, they just sort of appear in the pockets of my winter coats).** \n\n1. **Glossier Balm Dotcom**: I have two, strawberry and fig. Love the hint of tint, and yay! to the original formula! These are good moisturizer barriers for me, but if my lips aren’t already well hydrated, this makes them feel more dry after a while. **Verdict: best of the tinted balm options. Two is plenty, though it’ll probably be a while before I repurchase.**\n\n1. **Poppy and Pout Lip Balm**: I had this really cute idea two years ago that I was going to give these to a bunch of my girl cousins with a tiny art print for Christmas. We’re all grown with kids and don’t really exchange gifts, so it was just a nice little thing. But then I just didn’t? The timing is weird, I just didn’t hand them out. So now I have six of these motherfuckers. Luckily they’re really good. One of the rare balms that also actually moisturizes and doesn’t just create a barrier. And they’re pretty. **Verdict: I never need to buy another one again, but I would if I did.** \n\n\n\n**Makeup and Miscellaneous**\n\n1. **Patrick Ta Major Headlines Double-Take Crème & Powder Blush Duo:** Ugh, regret buying this one. It has gorgeous, luxury packaging, but it’s so pigmented, it’s almost unusable for me (and I’ll admit, that’s probably a big positive for other people). Definitely cannot use both the cream and the powder layered, although that’s what really appealed to me when I bought it. Right now, I mostly use the cream for work days when I’m wearing more makeup. I have to have a light touch when applying and blend it well. **Verdict: beautiful product, but not for me. Will not repurchase.** \n\n1. **Flower Beauty Gel Crush**: This is such a great product at such a great price ($12 when I picked it up on a whim). I have the peach color, and one swipe across my cheekbones gives me a beautiful watercolor wash. It especially shines for me on low makeup days. Just this gives me a healthy, natural glow. **Verdict: will definitely rebuy, but this tube has already lasted a long time with plenty to go.**\n\n1. **Lume Whole Body Deodorant**: Up until a week or two ago, I’ve been extolling the virtues of this deodorant. Love that it’s an aluminum free product that actually works (until it doesn’t?). I’m a naturally stinky human. My armpits smell like three day old sweaty gym sock feet if I don’t stage an intervention. I've been using Dove clinical strength for years, it does a good job, but I have Alzheimer’s on both sides of my family, and anything that might be a contributing factor gives me pause. So Lume got me through the entire summer. It’s great. But suddenly my left armpits specifically is breaking through the odor barrier, and I smell funky at the end of the day. So I don’t know. I don’t want to go back, but I might try layering with a swipe of TO’s glycolic toner first and letting that dry down. (Side note, does anyone actually get 72 hours out of one application of any deodorant? Is this just a lie they’re allowed to keep telling?) **Verdict: still in it’s probation period, will purchase once more and evaluate.** \n\n1. **Milk Hydro Grip Dewy Makeup Setting Spray**: I like this stuff. Definitely settles my makeup and the finish is really nice. The hold is kind of light, though, and to be honest, the Beekman Milkshake does the same thing, so I’ll skip this once I finish the bottle. **Verdict: does what it says, but won’t repurchase.**\n\n1. **Urban Decay All-Nighter Waterproof Makeup Setting Spray**: This is what I use when I do my makeup at 7am, attend a conference all day and go straight to a dinner after with just enough time to put on more lipstick. Especially if you start with a primer, this stuff has holding power. **Verdict: Not an every day product, but when I need it, invaluable. Will keep it on hand.**\n\n1. **Just for Men Beard Tint**: This is hands down my favorite beauty product I’ve started using in the last couple years. My eyebrows are naturally white blonde, and you really can’t see them against my skin. For years, I just thought that meant I didn’t need to do anything to them (brightside, I missed the aggressive tweezing phase my friends are still recovering from) but then I decided to get them waxed and tinted, and it was incredible. It gave my face so much more definition to have actual, visible eyebrows. I loooooved it, but it was $50, and my skin didn’t love the wax. Then I started getting them threaded and tinted, which my skin liked better, but it was still $30 every couple of weeks. After hearing this tint mentioned in Reddit thread, I decided to give it a go. The kit costs $13, I reapply one to two weeks, and you only need little dots each time, so it’s lasted almost a year. The brush it comes with is too big, so I use a disposable mascara wand and an eyeshadow brush to apply. I used to outline my brows and Vaseline when I started, but it’s really not necessary, I just clean up any stray dye as I go with Q-tips. I also got a pack of little eyebrow razors, so I use them for shaping and maintenance, and then I’ll go in every couple months to get them threaded. It’s the best. Verdict: **Life changing. Will absolutely repurchase before I run out.** \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I should really clean out my cabinets more often! And I should absolutely buy less. I’d love to hear what you agree and disagree with!\n\n",

I think you can get good skincare at affordable price points, it just takes a bit of searching, knowing what your skin needs and trial and error.  Most of my heavy lifting skincare is done by my SPF and Rx teetinoin.  I use very basic hydrating skincare otherwise and don't use actives every day, just when I feel my skin needs exfoliation or I want to clear red marks from acne.  Less has definitely been more for me. I order most of my skincare from Asia as it's been hard to find products without a lot of fragrance or irritating ingredients that aren't really expensive. I'm in Canada and our drugstore prices are on par with Sephora.  I've given up on a lot of the products I can buy here as they just seem to mess up my skin. I do like French Pharmacy, but it's hit or miss for me, and I'm much happier with my affordable gentle Korean products. My skin hasn't been this nice in forever.",

        "body": "There’s definitely some truth to the idea that many skincare products are overpriced, and some natural oils like castor oil, sweet almond oil, and others do offer impressive benefits for the skin. Natural oils can be hydrating, soothing, and rich in antioxidants, which can help improve skin texture and moisture levels.\n\nHowever, it’s also important to note that certain skin concerns may require ingredients that oils alone can’t address, like acne, hyperpigmentation, or anti-aging. High-end products sometimes contain scientifically backed ingredients like retinoids, peptides, or certain acids that have been shown to target specific skin issues.\n\nIf you’re curious to experiment, it could be worth trying a simpler, more natural routine and seeing how your skin responds. Many people find success with minimalism in skincare, while others still benefit from a more tailored approach depending on their skin type and concerns. Your plan to test it out for six months sounds like a great way to find what works for you! Keep us posted!",

As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\n# Product Itself (Before Trying)\n\n**At a Glance (before opening)**:\n\n* Product size is 11.5 oz. / 326 g.\n* Product states that it is formulated with no parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, or petrolatum.\n* Product states that it is not tested on animals, is cruelty free, is ethically traded/sustainably sourced, comes from a certified corporation, is family founded, and is created with fair trade shea butter.\n   * [What does \"fair trade\" mean?](https://www.greenerchoices.org/fair-trade-certified/)\n* Product states that it is manufactured in the USA using globally-sourced ingredients.\n* Product jar itself is made from 35% recycled plastic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Description on Container**: \"Our Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream provides definition with a soft, flexible hold.  Formulated with Manuka Honey, Yogurt, and Fair Trade Shea Butter, this lightweight curl cream also hydrates and helps strengthen hair to reduce breakage while styling.  Experience significantly less breakage when used as the fifth and last step in the Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Directions For Use on Container**: \"After generously spraying hair with the MANUKA HONEY & YOGURT HYDRATE + REPAIR MULTI-ACTION LEAVE-IN, apply to clean, damp hair and work through.  Style as desired and air dry or diffuse to finish your look.  This is the ultimate finish to the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients as Listed on Container**: \"Water (Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin (Vegetable), VP/VA Copolymer, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Carbomer, Honey (Miel), Yogurt Extract, Yogurt Powder, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter, Inulin (Chicory Root), Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Hydroxide, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Sodium Phylate, Triethyl Citrate, Caprylyl Glycol, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredient Breakdown (with the help of the \"Is it CG?\" Engine):**\n\n1. Product contains two humectants: Glycerin (Vegetable) and Honey (Miel).\n   1. *Humectants absorb moisture and help balance dry and damaged hair, but humectants also pull moisture from the environment too.  It is advised to use humectants with caution if you live in environments are hot and dry.*\n2. Product contains two oils:  Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil and  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter.\n   1. *Oils are good at coating hair strands in order to seal moisture, but should be used with caution as they may build up over time (especially if you cowash).  It is advised to use a clarifying shampoo occasionally (about ever 2 weeks) to remove buildup that oils may cause.*\n3. Product contains a conditioning agent: Caprylyl Glycol.\n   1. *In this case, this conditioning agent is working as a film-forming ingredient over the hair.  Conditioning agents are water soluble but have potential to build up over time (can clean with clarifying shampoo, see note in oils for more info).*\n4. Product contains a moisturizing alcohol: Cetearyl Alcohol.\n   1. *Alcohols are generally added to hair products to improve their ability to penetrate hair.  This alcohol is considered a moisturizing alcohol, so it will not dry hair.*\n5. Product contains three botanical ingredients: Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, and Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter.\n   1. *Botanical ingredients are ingredients that are derived from plants.  Botanical ingredients generally help with cleansing, stimulating, nourishing, refreshing, soothing, moisturizing, normalizing, and deodorizing.*\n6. Product contains two preservatives: Benzoic Acid and Phenoxyethanol.\n   1. *Preservatives prevent growth of bacteria and micro-organisms in your product.*\n7. Product has fragrance.\n   1. *Fragrance is generally okay to use on hair.  People with scalp sensitivities or allergies to fragrance should avoid fragrance in products.*\n8. Product *may* contain a protein, but this would be a light protein if so: Yogurt Extract and Yogurt Powder.\n   1. *I am honestly not sure if this is a protein, but when looking up online, some sources do say that yogurt contains protein.  If this is a protein, it is likely a very weak form of protein that would not impact your hair too much (honestly, it would still probably be less protein than the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie, which contains silk protein).*\n\nHere is the full breakdown using the [\"is it CG?\"](http://www.isitcg.com/view/TZFBb9swDIX_CuHDYGMOeu8t8dJ1hyBGUqQY0AttszFRWTRoaYs27L-PyrKiN9N6j_z4-LvwxX1xHAlhJ7yEqAQ79PEN4VE8JfgE3-UcNcBL8ZgGxUDwGQ40Iys8jzzPNEAT1UGjhNNLUdQFW8dnEyqUW4xVDQ0FQk0O1q6XUVwNX13qSdlDeaIzBewcme7U3p3W0MgsLk2kNeydcW2jyoz2Ue4d_6AKHjRygD1bnwP37ONinmmKnhcoG1yCaAVHMrCr5n16thtWDZsYksoyk05xghb1jRnKHEKV34zcmFE7uUL8y6HcMTljvKWxvQTFPrzXrfwcsm09oF_EM8IXPnPAYNgblA67j0hPyv3IzlTbiQL3Jtrha1Sbf-X-D_HNR5dDakbuRRMcRIIxHEU76-0tn9tGRxnYVskXkgsPtmNLPiBpCqNysOifyIBXA6_CqrP13U2bxmyxED1O12xundoxuWttqBSsgIatQU6vwdluaX_yEfMxN-R_Cfew7nmwwSN5uSQzoc-vD4pnRd8TlJb0a5yq4s9f) engine.  I recommend using this engine even if you do not use the CG method because it lets you see what ingredients do what to your hair.  \n\n**Overall Impression Based on These Factors:**\n\nThis is my impression BEFORE trying the product.  Overall, this product sounds like a great replacement for those who are looking for a lightweight, protein-free (at least, from my analysis) curl cream.  I think this product would be a great alternative for those who liked the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but didn’t like the protein and weight that the Curl Smoothie had.  This product does have glycerin in it, which I know some hair types are sensitive to, so that could be a turn off for some people.  This product has a lot of moisturizing ingredients in it, so it will probably benefit those seeking moisture for their hair the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Information About the Hair this Product is Tested on (My Hair)\n\n**Curl type**: 3A \n\n**Porosity**: Medium-High \n\n**Width**: Fine \n\n**Length**: Somewhere between 12-24 inches \n\n**Density**: lower-normal \n\n**Damage**: I may have a little protein damage on my hair (may have overdid it with a rice wash), but other than that it is mostly healthy.  Last cut was a little over 3 weeks ago.  Last clarify wash was a week ago.  I generally have halo frizz around my scalp area which I am currently combatting with the upside-down shower method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other Products Used with this Product and Application Methods Used\n\n**Note**: All products are CG approved.  These are all the products I used on the day I tried this product.  I wash my hair every other day.\n\n**Pre-Treatment**: dampen hair, detangle with a little bit of the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt conditioner, scrunch out some wetness, apply overnight oil (sweet almond oil, olive oil, rosemary oil, tea tree oil mixture) and sleep with a processing cap on.\n\n**Shampoo**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Shampoo\n\n**Conditioner**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Conditioner\n\n**Deep Conditioner**: Raw Sugar Healing Power Hair Masque with Avocado Oil + Banana + Coconut Milk + Agave\n\n**Leave-in**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Multi-Action Leave-in\n\n**Curl Cream**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream (this product)\n\n**Gel**: Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard\n\n**Cast-breaker**: Shea Moisture 100% Argan Oil\n\n**Tools**: WetBrush Wet Brush, Microfiber head wraps (I use them as towels to scrunch), Xtava Black Orchid Diffuser, InfinityPro by Con Air Drier, my hands (for scrunching)\n\n**Method**: Wet hair while leaning forward (back of head facing ceiling and hair pointing down).  Shampoo roots while leaving forward and use praying hands to run shampoo over the rest of the hair.  Rinse leaning forward.  Apply conditioner leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute in product, squish to condish while leaning forward.  Let sit for 2-4 minutes.  Rinse while leaning forward.  Apply deep conditioner while leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute product.  Let sit for 8-15 minutes.  Squish to condish and leave a little in hair when finishing.  While leaning forward, apply leave-in and curl cream by using praying hands and then scrunching upwards.  Scrunch some of the moisture out of hair with a microfiber cloth, then praying hands + scrunch in gel.  Diffuse with Xtava’s Black Orchid diffuser on low heat low (\"cool\") speed, let hair sit for a couple minutes and scrunch out the cast with Shea Moisture’s 100% Pure Argan Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# First Impressions After Opening Product\n\nThe smell of the product is quite nice and very low-key.  It smells like the rest of this line if you have ever tried it.  The consistency is almost like lotion (if you have ever used Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion, think of that texture/look/consistency).  On a side note, the safety seal was INSANE to take off, so you’ll *definitely* know if someone tampered with your product.  When compared to the curl smoothie, the curl smoothie is a lot more “coagulated” (idk how else really to describe it) versus this product, so this whipped curl cream definitely gives the appearance of being lighter than the curl smoothie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Thoughts During Application\n\nI applied this product while upside down (leaning forward so that the back of my head faced the ceiling and my hair pointed downward) and with near soaking wet hair by running a small amount on my hands down the top of my head first (not raking in).  After that, I applied a little more to my hands and used prayer hands to apply it down the length of my hair.  Something interesting I noticed while doing this was that the cream seemed to soak in immediately, like, in literal seconds.  At first I thought I wasn't using enough product, but as I continued using prayer hands around my hair I noticed that the product melted in all around my head.  When I scrunched after using praying hands, I noticed that the curls seemed quite defined (I had a little wet frizz, but this is nothing out of the ordinary for me).  The smell was very pleasant and didn't bother me at all during the application.  Something else I noticed was that this product didn't provide the same \"slip,\" or slippery feeling, that the curl smoothie did.  This may be because it wasn't as heavy as the curl smoothie, but it did leave my hair with its normal, slightly rougher texture that I normally feel (it felt like how wet hair feels without any product added).  I kind of actually liked this, since to me that was proof that it wasn't going to weigh my hair down and didn't create a film over the hair that brought it down, but I could still tell it was working because of how well my hair was holding a curl while wet.  Overall, I probably used a little over a quarter's worth (maybe a half-dollar coin's worth) of product, which for me is more than I'd use for the curl smoothie but less than I thought I'd have to use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Results\n\n**Before Scrunching:** As I am sitting here letting my hair settle after diffusing, I am looking at my hair and noticing the amount of volume it has now before breaking the cast that I do not normally get.\n\n**After Scrunching:** Holy volume Batman!  So after scrunching, I noticed that my curls definitely look softer than they normally do with the curl smoothie.  I'm not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing at the moment, so I'll have to see how my hair holds up for the rest of the day.  The cast I had wasn't entirely crunchy, so I may not have diffused for long enough which could also be the culprit, but unknown.  My hair smells sooooo good but is not overwhelming, which is nice.  My hair also feels a lot softer after having scrunched, so it looks like the cream doesn't turn your hair super rough.  [Here is what my hair looked like after I scrunched it (not my closet, sorry for the clutter in the background).](https://imgur.com/a/T08BGx3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Verdict\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am only one person, and this is only one product review.  As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\nMaybe it is still too soon to tell, but I really, *really* like this cream after this first wash.  It didn't make my finer hair feel weighed down after a shower, and I didn't have to be super careful to not overdo it during application like I normally have to do for the curl smoothie.  My hair feels softer and less \"wet\" than it normally does after I scrunch the crunch, which may be due to my gel or this curl cream, but either way I'm liking it.  Now that my hair is crunched, it feels extremely bouncy (like, I'm bouncing in the mirror just to see how it bounces) and lightweight.  I don't know how it will hold up in the elements, since I haven't gone outside, but for now it looks great.\n\nConsidering the price for the amount of product, it seems like a pretty good deal.  The Whipped Curl Cream's container is 11.5 oz (interestingly enough, the curl smoothie is 12 oz, so it looks like someone at Shea Moisture wanted to be funny).  I bought the tub for $12, so it looks like that is nearly a dollar per ounce, which I consider to be good for the price.  I didn't have to use a ton of product to get the result I did, so I anticipate this tub lasting me at least 6 months if not longer.  \n\nThe smell and consistency were great in my opinion.  The product didn't feel \"goopy\" like the curl smoothie and essentially melted into my hair, which I was totally not expecting.  This is probably due to the \"whipped\" nature of the product, as products marketed as \"whipped\" tend to be lighter and absorbed easily.  The smell was not overpowering, and I actually kind of preferred it over the curl smoothie to be honest (after a while, the curl smoothie begins to smell like over scented baby-powder/diapers to me).\n\nOverall, I think this product is *definitely* worth checking out if you are looking for a lightweight curl cream, have used the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but feel weighed down by it, or are looking for a curl cream for finer hair.  The price is good, the product looks good, and I am very happy with the results.  \n\nI hope this review may have helped some of you curlies out there!  Good luck on your curl journey :)\n\n# After a Week Update\n\nGood morning y’all!  So it’s been a week since I bought this product and I’ve had some time to see how it performs with my hair.  I’ll start by saying I think that it’s done well for my hair in that it is so lightweight, but sometimes I still find it hard to style my hair without that “coating” the curl smoothie gave me.  I have noticed that I’ve had a bit more wet frizz than normal, which I had a really bad buildup episode so it could be that or this cream, but I’m really not sure.  I’ve still also noticed that my hair seems to become a bit more frizzy when I scrunch the crunch, but I have a funny feeling that that’s due to the new gel I tried and not this cream, but it could be.  Here is a pros and cons list of what I’ve noticed over the past couple days:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. Product is very light weight and clearly does not weigh down my hair.\n2. Product forms wet curls well when scrunched in (but may need a strong-hold gel after to keep them).\n3. Product smells great (I prefer it way more than the curl smoothie).\n4. Price point for product is very affordable.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. Product may not be able to support certain curl types without more hold (I have 3a hair, may work better for wavier hair but this could also be a gel problem).\n2. You will need to use more product than expected to get results.\n3. Product may contribute to wet frizz (my hair had a ton of buildup so this may have contributed too)\n4. This is not a curl cream that you can probably add in and then walk out for the day, it will most likely require a gel to help the hold.\n\nOverall, I’d rate it 7.5/10.  It’s worked really well for my hair, and this rating could go up when I try swapping my strong-hold gel back into my routine and see if it was the cream or the gel that isn’t holding my hair.  The product makes my hair so soft once my routine is done and doesn’t weigh my finer width hair down, but I do have to use more product than I normally did with the SM CS.  I’m definitely going to use up the rest of this jar, and I still highly recommend this to people who are looking for a lightweight curl cream to try.  Unfortunately, there is no sample size containers out there and I did email Shea Moisture asking about samples, but they essentially told me to take a hike so that was a no.  Regardless, if you are able to get your hands on this product, I think it is definitely worth a try!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for your extremely thorough original post, and for the update. Your hair looks great!\n\nI have somewhat similar hair, have been experimenting with products for a while, and have yet to find any holy grail products. Reviews like this help a lot!\n\nI used to have such a simple hair routine, several years ago. I’d occasionally shampoo with T-Gel for scalp issues, but would normally cowash with a conditioner (not CG) and use a little of the same stuff as a leave in, then scrunch with a T-shirt and air dry. Depending on how badly I needed a haircut, I wouldn’t need any styling product until refreshing, and my hair would have good clumpy ringlets up front and a good wave in the back on my short-ish style. But then my perfect conditioner was discontinued. My hair has never looked as good with so little effort since. \n\nIt’s improved a lot since this round with CG, mostly due to this sub. My curls can get curlier and the waves in the back are sometimes curls, but my hair seems really sensitive to both protein and humidity. I’m in the Pacific Northwest, so we can get a lot of humidity! I’m also sensitive or allergic to a ton of scents used in hair products, so that limits what I can try. \n\nSorry to rant all over your wonderful product review. You’ve actually helped with some of my curly hair frustrations because I think I’m going to try this curl cream.",

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

    "body": "Why hello! There’s a huge influx of new members now, and quite of few of you guys are also brand new to indies! While it seems like it should be a no-brainer, sometimes the transition from mainstream to indie can be a little confusing. And sometimes you may have a question (I’ve gotten several!) that you want to ask but don’t want to seem like you’re oblivious. So I’m compiling this short little FAQ of some common questions that people new to indies may have. If you’ve got a question, feel free to throw it my way and I’ll try to answer it (or someone else will) and it’ll be added to the post! Yay!\n\n**What is TAT?**\n\nTAT stands for turnaround time. This is the time it takes from you placing your order to your order being shipped out to you, also known as processing time. \n\n**How long is TAT?**\n\nThere is no universal length for TAT, so judging one company against the policies of another is a fast track to Sad Town. Some shops have a stated TAT of 1-3 days, while others state it can be up to 30 days between you ordering and your order being shipped. You’ll need to pay attention to the TAT, otherwise you may think that your order’s late when it’s really right within the shop’s stated TAT.\n\n**Does TAT include the weekend?**\n\nFor most shops, no. The number of days listed in the TAT will often explicitly state that these are business days. Business days are Monday through Friday. Holidays are not business days. Saturday does NOT count as a business day. So here’s an example!\n\nYou’ve placed an order on Thursday, December 18th with a shop with a stated TAT of 7 business days. That means that your order would need to ship by December 30th. The Christmas holiday falls into that time, and there are two weekends as well. Understanding TAT can help avoid impending heartbreak if a gift doesn’t arrive in time. So make sure you pay close attention to the shop’s TAT! Usually, it will be listed on the home page or within the FAQ. If you’re unsure, it’s probably wise to email the shop owner prior to placing an order!\n\n**Something is wrong with my order. Can I just post here for help?**\n\nAbsolutely you can ask for help with an order from the folks of IMAM! However, it’s really, really, REALLY recommended that you contact the shop owner first. Most of the time, they’re better equipped to answer your question than other customers are. Don’t ever be afraid to ask something or note that something’s not quite what you wanted!\n \n**How many people work at these companies?**\n\nIndie shops are often one or two person operations. Sometimes you’ll find that you don’t get a response to an email right away, or you’ll notice your invoices have the same handwriting all the time. That’s because these are tiny operations, often times within someone’s home or a small office elsewhere. One of the most important lessons you learn when you switch from mainstream to indie is that patience is indeed a virtue. Because products are often made as orders come in, or shops operate on very small stock, it can take a while to get through orders, especially without extra help and while working another primary job as many indie owners do. So, patience! Yeah!\n\n**How safe is buying indie?**\n\nAbout as safe as buying anything else. The overwhelming majority of reputable indies take sanitation and consumer safety very seriously. Shops have sterilization routines in place, and should some kind of contamination happen, most are quick to do a recall and announce a warning. As far as credit card safety, most indies use a third-party payment gateway to process cards and thus don’t ever have your credit card information on hand.\n\n**How do I know what a reputable indie shop is?**\n\nResearch research research! If you see a shop posted about frequently, and the interactions are overwhelmingly positive, you can feel safe shopping from that store. If you find a random shop on Etsy with no sales and no information anywhere else, use your best judgment. Some people opt to make a post on IMAM asking if anyone has experience with an unknown shop, and often times there are a few people who have taken that leap and just didn’t post about it. My advice is to choose a more well-known shop for your first few indie purchases before wading out into deeper water to avoid being possibly scammed/disappointed/angered.\n\n**What is [x product]?**\n\nYou’ll probably see a lot of commonly-referenced items in posts and it might be confusing. These items are usually some sort of base or fixative for eyeshadows, and they can be super helpful when working with loose shadows for the first time. So here’s a brief overview of the most common!\n\n* *Fyrinnae Pixie Epoxy* – Pixie Epoxy, sometimes shortened to PE, makes an appearance in a large number of swatch posts or EOTD/FOTD (eye/face of the day) looks. PE acts as a sticky base to help loose shadows and glittery things look their best. You'll want to give PE a little time to dry first before putting on your shadow (thanks, /u/infamousjoe!). It’s almost universally loved and is fairly simple to use. You may still want to find a primer to use beneath PE for added longevity.\n* *Darling Girl Glitter Glue* – You’ll find that people tend to use one or the other between PE and GG. They have the same purpose: allowing your sparkly shadows to stay put. GG might be a little bit more complicated, though, as you may need to let it dry for a bit before putting your shadow on. A primer beneath this sticky base may be needed.\n* *Darling Girl Primped & Primed Primer* – This primer acts similarly to mainstream eye primers. However, it can be tricky to work with. The temptation to scoop out quite a bit is great, but you really only need the very lightest amount. Adding more than just one quick tap from your fingertip can lead to creasing. This primer has a slightly steeper learning curve than others.\n* *Darling Girl Superstar Serum* – This isn’t a primer or a base, but is a helpful tool! Superstar Serum can be mixed with shadow to make a really awesome liquid liner solution. Just don’t squirt the serum right into your loose shadow jar. Tap a little shadow out onto a clean surface, then mix in a drop or two of the Superstar Serum. Stir it up with a toothpick or a brush and voila! Foiled liner!\n* *NYX Milk* – If you’re anything like me, you will have no idea what the hell this is despite seeing it in swatch posts everywhere. It’s a pencil. Now you don’t have to fake knowing! Milk is just a white eye pencil that many people use to make the color of their loose shadows stand out more.\n* *NYX Black Bean* – The opposite of Milk, Black Bean provides a dark base for shadows. Which NYX pencil you use really depends on personal preference.\n\n**Do I have to have a base/primer?**\n\nNo, you don’t. You don’t HAVE to do anything. To get the best look out of your loose shadows, though, I’d recommend nabbing at least one sticky base and one primer. They don’t have to be indie to work, so if you’ve already got a beloved primer or base, keep on using it!\n\n**What is [x acronym]?**\n\nSometimes acronyms pop up and it can be confusing. So let’s try and tackle some now!\n\n* AA - Alchimia Apothecary\n* BPAL - Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab (thanks, /u/hlg17!)\n* BV - Black Violet (thanks, /u/Kittytub!)\n* DC – Darling Clandestine\n* DE – Dawn Eyes\n* DG – Darling Girl\n* DH/DWH – Dreamworld Hermetica\n* FF – Femme Fatale\n* GDE – Glamour Doll Eyes\n* HG - holy grail, or a top, beloved product (thanks, /u/weintertwined!)\n* HoG - Haus of Gloi (Thanks /u/12oo!)\n* HW – Hello Waffle\n* LE – Life’s Entropy, but also used for limited edition\n* MPZ – My Pretty Zombie\n* SS – Solstice Scents\n\n**What is perfume oil? How is it different from regular perfume?**\n\nThe vast majority of indie scent companies opt to sell perfume oils rather than regular spray perfume that mainstream users are used to. It can be a bit intimidating trying to navigate these lovely-smelling waters, so I'll try and lay it out as best I can.\n\nA key difference between mainstream perfumes and indie perfume oils is in what's holding the scent together. In mainstream perfumes, scents float around with perfumer's alcohol. This alcohol is really fine and thus easily sprayed from your typical spray packaging. Scents in perfume oils, on the other hand, do their swimming around in--shocker!--oil. Oil is thicker and thus doesn't work so well with a sprayer. The sprayer tends to get clogged, and so you'll find perfume oils come in amber glass jars and you will have to dab the scent on rather than spray.\n\nAlcohol-based perfumes often times have higher sillage (the distance a scent travels from you to another nose, also known as throw). So, where an alcohol-based perfume may be detectable across the room, an oil-based perfume may only be noticeable at a more intimate distance, such as arm's length or whisper distance. \n\nOn the flip side, oil-based scents may last longer than alcohol-based. The alcohol-based scent may evaporate after a few hours, but an oil-based scent can last six or more hours, with some really pushing dangerously close to wearing out their welcome and clinging for days.\n\nThis isn't to say every alcohol-based perfume can be smelled farther away than every oil-based perfume, or every oil-based perfume lasts longer than every alcohol-based perfume. Lots of other factors, such as skin chemistry, notes used, and specific brands, can play a part in how long your perfume oil lasts.\n\n**What do you mean by skin chemistry?**\n\nThis is a fun one for me because I find this fascinating! Have you ever noticed how one eyeshadow or lip color can look a certain way on you but totally different on someone else? Thanks, skin tones and undertones! With scent, the same kind of thing happens. Everyone's skin chemistry, or the way their body reacts to a scent, is different, so you'll have vastly different experiences from one person to the next, all with the same scent. Example time again!\n\nOne of my first indie purchases was Jailbait from Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab. On me, the scent is a very lovely cherry scent that fades into a more adult, seductive scent. I wore Jailbait pretty much daily in college. However, I've seen people mention that Jailbait on them turns into a cloying orange scent and never changes. Skin chemistry!\n\nFlip side? Southern Gothic from sixteen92 is a favorite among many users here. For me, unfortunately, it goes horribly wrong and I can only smell BO and sadness.\n\nIt doesn't only apply to what smells good or what smells bad. Some people's skin amps up certain notes while not even allowing other notes to be great. For instance, someone's skin could amplify a cinnamon note in a perfume oil, while completely ignoring the floral notes in that same blend.\n\nReading perfume reviews is quite fun when you see how people's skin reacts to certain things. Eventually, you may start to notice reviewers who's skin acts similarly to your own and you can kind of compare notes! SCIENCE!\n\n**What's a carrier oil?**\n\nRemember when I talked about fragrance swimming around in oil? The oil housing the oil is known as a carrier. Indie perfume shops use different carrier oils based on their own preferences. Some common carrier oils include sweet almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, jojoba oil, and rice bran oil.\n\n**Why are perfume oils in amber/cobalt glass?**\n\nPerfume oils are sensitive to light. Exposure to too much light can cause the oils within to break down. This means the scent loses potency quickly and can even turn pretty funktastic. To try and help lessen that, most indie shops use amber glass or cobalt glass to try and filter light out. If you want to help your bottle out even more, store it in a dimly lit area!\n\n**How do I wear perfume oil?**\n\nYou'd think it would be kind of intuitive, but if you're just to just pressing a pump and then smelling fabulous,  an oil can be confusing. There is no wrong way to wear your perfume oil, assuming you don't just dump the whole bottle onto yourself. I mean, you could do that, but it's not really recommended. For oils with no dropper in place, one of the easiest methods is placing a fingertip over the opening, making sure you're covering it fully to avoid spillage, then turning it over briefly. When you remove your fingertip, there will be a decent amount of oil left and you can rub it wherever you'd like! Some people also just rub some oil from the lid in order to get a small amount. If your oil bottle does have a stopper, you can just tap the bottom of the bottle until a drop pops out.\n\nI hope this is helpful to at least a handful of you! This is by no means comprehensive so if you still have questions, ask! Please enjoy your trip down the rabbit hole. Tip your waitress!\n",

    "body": "**Product** ~ Vaseline Lip Therapy (Rosy lips variant). 🌹\n\n**Skin type** ~ Oily and acne prone.🧴\n\n**Current climatic condition** ~ Cold and dry. ❄️ \n\n**Age** ~ 22 F \n\n**Usage timeline** ~ One month. \n\n**Routine** ~  AM 🌞 ~ Clean & Clear Cleanser, Plum Niacinamide toner, Aloe Vera gel, Cetaphil moisturiser, Re’equil ultra matte sunscreen, lip balm. \n\nPM 🌙 ~ Double cleansing (Garneir miceller water), The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid and Panthenol Serum, Tretinoin, Aquasoft moisturiser, lip balm. \n\n**Price** ~ 💸 ₹270 for 17g, I got mine from the grocery store where there was a B1G1 offer so I paid ₹135. 🛒\n\n**Ingredients list** ~ Petrolatum, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Rosa Damascena Oil, Aroma, Linalool, Ci 73360, Ci 77891. \n \n**Review** ~ It is definitely one of the best lip balms I’ve tried. 👍🏼\n\n**Consistency** ~ It has a thick gel-like consistency and is extremely moisturising and emollient. It feels like a thick moisturising layer of petroleum jelly on the lips. \n\n**Colour** This variant has a pinkish tint but it’s not that visible when applied on the lips. It has a slight rosy fragrance. \n\nAfter application it looks a little shiny on the lips. Not over the top glossy. It leaves a beautiful sheen on the lips. \n\n**Thoughts** ~ The staying power is pretty good. I rarely need to reapply anything throughout the day. It keeps the lips moisturised\nthroughout the day. My lips don’t dry up easily so that’s a factor too. I didn’t notice my lips flaking or cracking up after a few hours of usage which I’ve experienced with some lip balms in order to keep reapplying them. It’s great to use this under lipstick as well. \nIf you use this at nighttime, you’ll wake up with the most beautiful and hydrated lips in the morning. 💋\nAbsolutely love this. 💕\n\nThe only drawback is the tin packaging. Looks quite aesthetic but it is a pain to open the lid. 😭 \n\n\n**Final thoughts** ~ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ \nHG will definitely repurchase. 🛍️",

    "body": "Sharing my post here as well. Recently, I had posted requesting dupes for Bite's Agave Lip Mask as it is now being discontinued. This stuff is ride or die lip salvation for me. I live somewhere super dry, work in a dry environment, take meds that dry me out, you get the picture. I'm a moisture junkie. I gathered the piece that works is the lanolin in it so I tried some similar products and wrote some reviews of them.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It also got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. It's good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. It's a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. It's a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, it's going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!",

I usually have to warm a little of the product on my finger before applying it because it is so thick. It has a very slightly minty scent and a slight cooling sensation on application. It comes in a small tin, and one tin lasts me approximately a year of twice daily use. I also work in a hospital environment, and this is the only balm that has ever adequately protected my lips from the dry hospital air. It’s also currently $10 (half off) on their website. Thanks to you, I looked it up so I could post the ingredients and saw the sale so I’ll probably stock up on a little more!\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Cera Alba (Beeswax, Cire d'abeille), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Water/Aqua/Eau, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Aroma (Flavor), Urea, Mel (Honey, Miel), Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hydroxide, EDTA, Eugenol.",

I usually use whatever face lotion I'm using at night on my lips and then put my lanolips on.

Idk what they call it in other places.\n\nIf it's mainly just the itching then do go to dermatologist. But also take the aftercare your artist suggested.\n\nI'd switch to simple moisturizer tho. Using simple Nivea soft (the white one) works really well on tattoos.\n\nAlso you can lightly slap on the area the itch will soothe a bit. But if too itchy definitely go to Doctor. Even if it's not infected, you might be allergic to colours or the brand of ink they used. There might be lot of factorsm",

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out Asian Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/fz2kw4/list_of_panthenol_products_asian_beauty_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ - Very affordable (\\~$1-12)\n\n$$ - Affordable-ish (\\~$13-24)\n\n$$$ - Mid-range (\\~$25-55)\n\n$$$$ - High-end (\\~$56-100)\n\n$$$$$ - Luxury/Medical Grade (\\~$100+)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Disclosed Panthenol %\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [The Ordinary Amino Acids + B5](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-amino-acids-b5-30ml?redir=1) (5% panthenol, 17% amino acids)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Gel B5 Pro-Recovery Skincare 40ml](https://www.escentual.com/la-roche-posay/larocheposay072/) ($$) - 5% panthenol, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, copper gluconate, vitamin e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 ($$) - 5% panthenol, shea butter, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, copper gluconate ( [https://www.escentual.com/lrpcicaplastbaume001/](https://www.escentual.com/lrpcicaplastbaume001/) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Medisei Panthenol Extra](https://www.ebay.com/itm/PANTHENOL-EXTRA-CREAM-FOR-IRRITATED-SENSITIVE-SKIN-WITH-PANTHENOL-UREA-100ML/263780836273?epid=2260763521&hash=item3d6a9023b1:g:4v0AAOSwZrdbMl27) ($) - 5% panthenol, 5% urea *(Comes in a 100ml tube, very light-weight.

    "body": "Okay so, recently I asked for help to build up an oil guide, so I decided to post what I've got together so far! If more info is given then I'll edit this to add it in. Thank you to the masses of people who gave info the help me expand this list, and hopefully this can help out some other folk too!\n\n*****\n\n**This is a guide to give personal input and experiences from valued members of the /r/skincareaddiction thread on reddit. This gives an insight into the different effects, usages and other desired info that might be desired from first hand users.**\n\n*****\n\nTo gain insight into the technical aspects of any oil please refer to [this](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html) guide. If you don’t want to scroll simply use ctrl+f to search the page for the desired oil to read up on the base information for it.\n\nAll oils have a limited shelf life. Please use the above guide to check the shelf life of most oils if you purchase any. Don’t use oil you think may be out of date on any part of you. You can extend the life of an oil by keeping it in the fridge, or if you have loads and won’t be using a chunk of it for a while it can be frozen. Please store your oils in the best way you have available to you.\n\n*****\n\n###If any information within this is incorrect, you have anything to add to it, or any other anecdotes then please do tell me. This was built from peoples comments and experiences so I'm happy to alter it to give a more well rounded view or accurate information where needed###\n\n*****\n\n\n**Apricot Kernel Oil**\n\n* One of the thinner oils\n* Doesn’t have a particular scent\n* Doesn’t often cause bad reactions but as always, this isn’t the case for everyone\n* Very nourishing for the skin\n* Easily absorbed\n* Though I don’t know why you would, DON’T CONSUME. Can be very dangerous\n* Has anti-ageing properties\n* Can be used to treat eczema, razor rash and sunburn\n\n**Argan Oil**\n\n* Golden brown in colour\n* Smells vaguely nutty – if it doesn’t smell very nutty it’ll be diluted cheap stuff and won’t help you\n* Very popular as a multi-use for skin and hair\n* One of the thinner oils but a little goes a long way\n* Absorbs quickly\n* Can be used effectively around the eyes\n* A favourite with respected skin care bloggers\n* Moisturising and can even out skin tone\n* Described as having a “silky” feel\n\n**Avocado Oil**\n\n* Spectacular for hair\n* Easily available at most supermarkets and shops for cheap\n* Not recommended for skin\n* Comedogenic – can cause blackheads by blocking pores\n* Goes off faster than most oils – will smell horrible and turn dark yellow when it’s off\n\n**Black Cumin Seed Oil**\n\n* Can be very quenching and result in smooth feeling skin\n* Due to its colour it can leave you a slight glow. This can be beneficial to some, but be careful in case it doesn’t work as desired for you\n* Doesn’t often break out people who are prone to acne\n* Smells like toasted nuts with a hint of caramel\n* Similar to Argan oil in consistency – quite thin, not sticky\n\n**Black Raspberry Seed Oil**\n\n* Smells fantastic according to most\n* Light green in colour\n* Full of antioxidants\n\n**Carrot Seed Oil**\n\n* Dark green in colour\n* Very powerful earthy scent – smell can linger so be wary that you may smell like it for a bit\n* If used in its pure form then be sure to dilute it. However, most types of it are macerated. (softened/diluted with liquid)\n* Very rich – not suitable for acne prone or easily irritated skin\n* Has an average absorption rate – will take a while to soak in\n\n**Castor Oil**\n\n* VERY thick and sticky/waxy\n* Is supposed to be great for improving hair growth – including eyelashes, eyebrows, scalp, etc. While this can be beneficial, some people report using it on their skin makes their peach hair darker and similar effects whereas others report no change, so be wary that this may affect you\n* Very drying so MUST be used with something else\n* Works fantastically in lip products to give your lips a glossy appearance\n* There’s so many different types of it that cause such varying effects depending on them that it’s pretty risky\n\n**Coconut Oil**\n\n* Raved about for hair because it’s one of the only two known oils that can penetrate deeply into it, allowing your hair to really be effected by it and not just coated.\n* When used on hair it’s very effective at controlling frizziness\n* Can’t just be rinsed out of hair, must be lathered and rinsed out so if you’re doing a no-shampoo regime or something then don’t use it\n* A riskier oil for skin as while some peoples skin loves it, it can cause horrific break outs in others – especially on the face\n* Refined coconut oil shouldn’t be used. It can be identified due to having barely any smell of coconut – You should only buy unrefined, extra virgin coconut oil for bodily use\n* Said that it can be used to reduce the appearance of skin marks such as Keratosis Pilaris\n* Can even be used on dogs to keep their coats healthy, if that’s a bonus to you\n\n**Emu Oil**\n\n* Mid-range thickness and milky in colour\n* A slightly unfavourable smell but not overpowering (such as Neem Oil)\n* Can be used for hair but isn’t very popular as many people don’t see desired results, so other oils are likely a better choice\n* If used correctly, it can be very hydrating\n* Not vegetarian or vegan at all – it’s emu fat\n* Is supposed to help products penetrate better, reduce inflammation, increase healing and plump your skin\n* Good for dry skin\n\n**Evening Primrose Oil**\n\n* Good for people who are acne prone, have dry skin or eczema\n* Needs diluted\n\n**Extra Virgin Olive Oil**\n\n* Rich\n* One of the thicker liquid oils\n* Effective make-up remover\n* Leaves a “plump and smooth” feeling to the skin\n* Can be very effective at reducing the appearance of SF’s\n\n**Hemp Seed Oil**\n\n* Very, very popular. Especially for use in OCM’s\n* Thin, hydrating and quick to dry down\n* Can be used on its own if it works with your skin – as a cleanser and hydrator/moisturiser\n* Ensure to wear with sunscreen\n* Strange smell - can be off putting for some\n* Green in colour\n\n**Jojoba Oil**\n\n* Dark golden yellow in colour\n* Has an earthy scent\n* Very thick. Feels almost slimy on the skin – described as “liquid wax”\n* Takes a long time to absorb so can feel almost like wearing a face mask\n* Can cause break outs – definitely patch test thoroughly\n* Is another one that can help hair growth, especially eyelashes, so can be added to mascara’s that are drying out to help\n\n**Macadamia Oil**\n\n* mildly comedogenic\n* light\n* fast absorbing\n* slight nutty smell that disappears after a bit\n\n**Mineral Oil**\n\n* Clear\n* Probably one of, if not the, thinnest oils – similar consistency to water\n* Can’t soak into the skin so can only be used as a cleanser/occlusive – better to use a moisturiser with it, but it isn’t drying\n* The least likely oil to break you out, yay! Just make sure to use un-fragranced as the fragrance can break people out. If the fragranced works for you then go for it though. (Fragranced mineral oil is just baby oil)\n* Great make-up remover\n* Probably the most popular for OCM’s\n* Leaves the face feeling very clean\n* Some people say it can make redness more apparent, but this is more specific to the user as others say it reduces redness significantly. As it’s the least likely to break you out, it’s one of the safest to try\n\n**Neem Oil**\n\n* A dark honey colour\n* Can be quite expensive\n* Extremely thick in consistency and solidifies when cold\n* Horrifically bad smelling so not for the light-hearted\n* Incredible for treating acne of all types. Will almost completely clear deep acne in a matter of days, and can do the same for surface acne in as little as 24 hours in some people\n* Despite its strength, it’s quite moisturising which is a benefit over other strong oils such as Tea Tree which can dry you out\n* Contains steroids - same steroids can also be found in many fruits and veg and can be quite beneficial, so don't fear, but just a heads up for anybody who didn't know\n\n**Sea Buckthorn Oil**\n\n* Can help even skin tone and lightening PIH\n* Bright orange in colour – can stain the skin if not careful\n* Can be used to make DIY products\n\n**Squalene Oil**\n\n* Comes in bottle and capsule version\n* Capsule version is thicker and milkier\n* Really good at helping other oils be absorbed\n\n**Sunflower Seed Oil**\n\n* Golden colour\n* Slight scent\n* An effective cleanser similar to extra virgin olive oil, but can be less clogging than it for some people\n\n**Sweet Almond Oil**\n\n* Pale yellow\n* No real smell\n* Softening\n* Doesn’t often cause bad reactions\n* Reasonably thick\n* Great carrier/dilution oil\n\n**Tamanu Oil**\n\n* Very dark green, almost black, in colour\n* Strong nutty scent but isn’t overpowering\n* Reasonably thick\n* Doesn’t absorb immediately, takes a little time but will absorb well if you leave it a little while\n* Analgesic (can relieve pain)\n* Anti-bacterial\n* Due to the above things, it can be very beneficial for acne prone or irritated skin\n\n**Tea Tree Oil**\n\n* Must be used minimally and diluted so as not to dry out or burn the skin – if used without diluting it can make your skin dry and scaly, or burn it badly\n* If used correctly it can make an effective spot treatment. One such method includes making a diluted tea tree and jojoba oil mix.\n* Can be very effective at preventing/clearing clogged pores, whiteheads and the likes\n* Anti-inflammatory properties\n* MUST use with a moisturiser\n* Has a “clean” smell\n\n**Watermelon Seed Oil**\n\n* Light yellow in colour\n* Only has a mild scent\n* Very light\n* Absorbs quickly\n* Can be quite drying so use with a moisturiser, but this makes it beneficial for oily skin\n* Good for irritated skin as it can be calming\n\n*****\n\n###If any lovely person can provide info on the following oils, I'd greatly appreciate it, and the people who requested it would too ;)###\n\n* Rosehip Seed Oil\n* Sesame Seed Oil\n* Vitamin E Oil\n* Vitamin K Oil",

Virgin has a mild coconut smell, and refined has virtually NO odor. I've always seen odorlessness listed as the way to identify refined coconut oil.

    "body": "👍 Derma B Repair Cream Wash: very good fragrance free body wash. I'm sensitive and sometimes I need a blank canvas for skincare. Will probably rebuy when the price is appropriate. \n\n👍 Megababe Le Tush: I probably won't need to rebuy, because these are so often GWP in Ulta's stock lol. Probably a coupon only buy for me. \n\n👍 Laneige Cica Sleeping Mask: snice. Not sure it's a rebuy soon, as I seem to need more potent moisturizers at present as I now use azelaic three times a week or so. Maybe this is a product to revisit next summer. \n\n😍 MAC Fix+: I love it. It's a coupon buy for me; restocked during Ulta sales recently. I use this before foundation and between any other layers like blush, highlighter. Milani Make It Last gives it a run for it's money, sure enough. \n\n🥰 Givenchy Irresistible: I adore it, bought a bottle during a suspiciously well timed GWP right after. Damn you Ulta. It's super pretty. \n\n🪨 LRP Anthelios AOX 50: I keep going back to this even when I'm supposed to be trying alternatives lol, but October was a month during which I needed consistency for work makeup prep. If I see it on sale again soon I'll probably get more. \n\n👍 Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil: good post shower carrier oil when I need something stronger than fractionated coconut, but don't want an opinionated scent. Already repurchased. \n\n🫡 CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion: I found a bit leftover and finished it off. This was my go to for a couple years. A good product, but too lightweight for me now. If you're combo sensitive, give this a shot. \n\n🥰 Jason Vitamin E Oil: kind of a cheat because I just refilled my pump bottle with this, but my used up bucket is being relocated. This smells like what I want from almond-y products - marzipan! Delicious and moisturizing. A delightful post-showed treat. Automatic re buy for me. \n\n🏆 Goldbond Softening Foot Cream: the absolute GOAT foot cream, maybe my favorite rebuy of all time. This absolutely changed my feet, obliterated all cracks and is my ride or die skincare product at this point. Urea is the key! \n\n🙄 Clarins Total Eye Lift: I assume a sample doesn't have enough to appreciate it's magicalness, or, more likely, that eye creams all tend to just blur together for me. Meh. \n\n🫨 Clarins Double Serum: I really like this. But not that price tag, hell no. For that price I better look ten years younger. Surprisingly I love the scent. But not for that price, nerp.\n\n💯 Elf Lash XTNDR: this is the best brown tubing drugstore mascara, IF ONLY because it doesn't dry out quite as fast as the Maybelline Sky High brown tuber. Priced to play. \n\n🤨 Boucheron Jaipur: this reminds me of a family friend from childhood: predictably classy, if not perhaps a bit kooky. I think I might be having a flashback to a nice but crazy lady when I smell this. Glad to be done with it. \n\n👍 Tory Burch Sublime: nice! I have a few samples and a mini bottle from Ulta GWP to spend more time with this. It's subtley sexy, a nice day to evening scent. \n\n🫡 Hero blemish patches: a good GWP inclusion. But I think I prefer the K Beauty brand iterations, so I won't be buying these again. My first zit stickers brand, glad to have had them. \n\n🤔 Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream: it's very good. Still not sure I'll buy it. The slight coolness is nice. I'm working on other options to broaden my horizons. This is the evening cream to beat for me so far. \n\n👍 Innisfree Aloe Energy Mask: delightful and refreshing. Used one hot annoying evening: great moisturizing and nice scent. Will repurchase. \n\n🫠 Hydrinity mask (not pictured) A free sample from some online order. I was really impressed with the results, my skin was well hydrated, softer, really nice...but $18 apiece, urm, uh...hmmmmmm......\n\n",

Rare Beauty is charging $20 for their lip oils while the Etude Glass Rouge Tint costs $7.21 over on YesStyle.com.\n\n\n\nRare Beauty Lip Oil:\nWater (Aqua/Eau), Diphenyl Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Octyldodecanol, Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Menthoxypropanediol, Ceteareth-20, Squalane, Fragrance (Parfum), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Stevioside, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Polyacrylate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Eugenol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Yellow 6 (CI 15985), Red 28 (CI 45410), Red 33 (CI 17200), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090)\n\n\n\nEtude Glass Rouge Tint:\nWater / Aqua / Eau, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Octyldodecanol, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene (Glycerin), Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, Phenoxyethanol, Squalane, Fragrance / Parfum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sunset Yellow FCF (CI 15985), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Fruit Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Red 33 (CI 17200), Red 28 (CI 45410)\n\n\nThe only differences I can find is that Rare Beauty added menthol to give a tingly feeling. And the oils are different. Rare Beauty uses jojoba and Sunflower oils. ETUDE uses Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Apricot Oil, Evening Primrose Oil and Sweet Almond Oil. Rare Beauty also uses Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, and Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract. While Etude just uses Mango Fruit Extract.\n\nHave you seen this before, where a company dupes another company's formula and then charges more for it?",

I'd rather have an inclusive shade range that's easier for me to purchase, even at a higher price. \n\nAlso I don't see how this etude house tint is any different to romand's juicy lasting tint, or glasting tint, or any tint that has a glassy finish. Yeah, rare beauty does have a lot of aesthetics taken from k-beauty but like everyone else is saying, it's probably not exactly the same. Not everything is meant to be a dupe.\n\nEdit: also most korean lip tints dry down, and do not feel like lip oils at all. The etude one isnt even described as an oil so i fail to see how comparable they are.",

I've been on reddit and subscribed to this sub forEVER but I've only recently come out of lurk-mode.  I've been meaning to introduce myself for a while, but I am easily distracted (ooooh, squirrel!!)  I have a decent sized update happening tomorrow, so I am using that as an excuse to finally say hey!\n\nFirst off,  I started Cattail Apothecary back in November 2016...I make all natural skincare/self care products, herbal remedies and witchy ritual tools.  I am an herbalist, I have been studying herbs/plants for over 20 years, so there's a heavy emphasis on that.  While I do like to scent my products, the essential oils used are chosen less for how the smell, and more for what they do.  I try to find a good balance between form and function.\n\nAs I mentioned, I have an update happening tomorrow.  Some of the products I offer change due to the seasons, because I grow and wildcraft a lot of my own plant material. Tomorrow (update goes live at 2pm est), on top of the large catalog of usual stuff, I will have:\n\n* Whipped Rose Face Butter - This is a super rich face moisturizer that features mango and shea butters, rose-infused sweet almond oil, rosehip seed oil, honey, carrot, beetroot, clary sage, cypress and more meant to hydrate and nourish the skin while targeting fine lines and wrinkles.  This product sells out FAST and I only restock every 6-8 weeks.\n* Out, Damned Spot - All new blemish treatment oil featuring white willow and yarrow infused safflower oil plus borage seed, tamanu, rosemary extract, lemon and lovely blue tansy.\n* Violets & Amethyst Mist - This is last year's popular seasonal toner/cleanser spray making a return!

    "body": "**Intro (copy and pasted from my original post, FYI)**  \nHi Everyone! I have recently taken it upon myself to purchase and review body oils from many many different indie brands. I originally was going to post this as one big post but I have gathered so many oils and have so many opinions on them that I think it's best to break it up a little bit into a few different posts as I go along. If there's any oils you want to see reviewed, please let me know and I will do my best to get my hands on some.  \n  \n**About my skin:** I have very dry, eczema prone skin. I have had psoriasis in the past but do not currently. I am sensitive on the inside of my elbows and behind my knees where the skin is thin.  \n  \n**What I like:** You will notice I prefer a bit of a thicker oil. I know this is not always everyones preference so I have also reviews some thinner oils. I try all the oils in the same way: Coating my body head to toe and sleeping with the oil on my skin. In the morning, my skin will either feel adequately moisturized or still a bit dry.  \n  \n**Cocoa Pink Dry Oil Body Spray (2oz = 5.25 USD, +/- 2.63/oz)**  \n(Naughty Gingerbread: Naughty begins with two of our bestselling fragrance oils specially formulated just for CocoaPink: Spiritueuse Double Vanilla and our exclusive triple amber blend that we call “CP Black”.  Then we added a dash of gingerbread and a splash of sugar.  Try not to lick this one off.)  \n**Ingredients:** Fractionated Coconut oil, Isoproyl Mystearate, Jojoba oil, Cyclomethicone, Fragrance.  \n  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** This one is somewhere right in the middle. Feels heavier than Solstice Scents’ Burnishing Glacé and Alchemic Muse Body Gloss, but Lighter than Sucreabeille’s Body Oil and the other Cocoa Pink I reviewed [Here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/7blc22/indie_body_oil_review_bonanza_part_1_of_a_lot_of/). I like this one and feel like it might be my favourite one for the bath, I felt like I needed less of this in the bath than some of the other ones but my skin still feels soft after using it.   \n**Scent:** Oh my. Oh my freaking god. This is so good. I keep all of my body oils in a container on my desk beside my laptop. As I’ve been watching Netflix recently I will sometimes just sit there and smell this. It’s that good. I can’t be around it without opening it and smelling it. It’s a sweet gourmand, I would describe it as a “frosted gingerbread”. It’s more sweet than spicy but it’s still quite spicy. I’ve layered it with Solstice Scents Dark Ginger Spice Cake (which is much less sweet and more herbal). It’s possible I was meant to be born a gingerbread woman. After sleeping in this, in the morning the scent has barely faded!  \n  \n**Alchemic Muse (4oz = 12.00 USD, +/- 3.00 USD/oz)**  \nBody Gloss (Vanilla Oak: Flighty top notes of bergamot, camphor, cassia root lead to a heart of smoky vanilla-tobacco and warm spice grounded with aged oak, soft amber, and frankincense)  \n  \n**Ingredients:** Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Fractionated Coconut Oil), Cyclomethicone, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Olive Squalane, Cymbidium Grandiflorum (Orchid) Flower Extract, Fragrance  \n  \n**Notes:**\n**Formula:** This is another lighter one. I expected something a bit different, being that it’s called Body Gloss, I thought it would give you a bit of a glossy, coated feeling but actually of the oils I’ve tried so far this one sinks in the fastest. Definitely would be ok to use in the morning before getting dressed. This one also is nice as a bath oil and I feel like it really absorbs nicely, when you get out of the bath you can tell you don’t necessarily need to apply lotion.  \n**Scent:** This is not at all what I was expecting but the scent is really nice. I don’t get any of the top notes (not that I know what Camphor or Cassia root really smell like). It’s mainly a Sweet Vanilla with some woods, but I would not say it’s very deep or very sweet. I think a ton of people would like this scent, it’s just nice. I also get the impression that I’ve smelled this scent somewhere before but I can’t put my finger on it.   \n  \n**Queen Bee Apothecary Dry Oil Body Mist (1oz=6.00 USD)** \n (Femme Noir: a blend of bitter orange, vanilla, sandalwoods & ambers, rose & jasmine......but this is what it smells like to me.....an initial bold blast of tobacco, sweet and rich but spiced in a sultry way. It soon develops a delicious powdery femme quality and sweetens with vanilla. A pristine blend.)  \n  \n**Ingredients:** Cyclomethicone, Organic Coconut Oil, Fragrance  \n  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** Another thinner one. This formula is similar to that of Solstice Scents, See my review [Here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/7blc22/indie_body_oil_review_bonanza_part_1_of_a_lot_of/), if anything it’s just a touch lighter. Again, not moisturizing enough for my personal taste but I will continue to use it as a bath oil.  \n**Scent:** This is quite a powdery scent on me, I don’t get any orange or rose. Mainly Sandalwood and Jasmine. Nice enough but I wouldn’t repurchase. I will say my mom is obsessed with this scent and she tends to like very deep,sweet patchouli scents (she’s big on Aromatics Elixir and Angel, so if those are your jam, this might be for you. Never got any orange here either, Am I an Orange black hole? I would never have known because I don’t gravitate towards citrus fragrances.   \n**Queen Bee Bath and Body Oil (2oz = 6.00 USD, +/-3.00 USD /oz)**  \n(Whiskey River: This whiskey scent is still made with the scent of pure, amber southern whiskey, but also has notes of mixed spice, walnut nuances, benzoin & oak. This does have a rich, boozy scent but a little lighter on the sweetness.)  \n  \n**Ingredients:** Soybean Oil, Safflower Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Grape Seed Oil, PEG-40 Sorbitan Peroleate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance  \n  \n**Notes:**\n**Formula:** This is to date the thickest oil I’ve tried. I do like the formula despite it being thicker and taking quite a while to sink in (20-25 mins). My skin felt nice in the morning but it’s not the most moisturizing of the formulas I have tried. I haven’t tried this one in the bath yet, unfortunately.  \n**Scent:** I have truly never experienced anything like what I have experienced with this scent. Don’t even look at the notes, they mean nothing. When I opened the bottle upon it’s arrival, I smell unadulterated cherry cough syrup. It’s the weirdest thing. Sprayed out of the bottle, into my hand, I smell chocolate with a hint of cherry. Worked into the skin it’s literally just plain cinnamon stick. What?????\n  \nI think I only have 2 formulas left to review after this! Some Witch Baby and some Epically Epic! Again, if you have any questions feel free and if you have any recommendations I would love to hear those too :)\n",

The only difference I can tell between the dupe and the original (testing side by side) is that the dupe takes slightly longer to absorb and is a little less “dry”. \n\nMCT Oil - 48%\n\nSweet Almond Oil - 35%\n\nFragranced Sweet Almond Oil - 6%\n\nOctyldodecanol -2%\n\nCamelina Oil - 2%\n\nRosehip Oil - 2%\n\nSunflower Seed Oil -2%\n\nSea Buckthorn Oil -2%\n\nVitamin E -1%\n\nI mixed the ingredients in a hot water bath at 100f to help the vitamin E distribute.\n\nThe original formula also advertises as being 50% sweet almond oil, which didn’t work for me. It made the formula too sticky and took too long to absorb, so I’m not sure exactly how they manage that. Maybe a higher quality oil? Increasing the MCT oil really helped to thin it out and increase absorption.\n\nThe fragranced oil I used was a dupe of baccarat rouge 540 that I like, but next batch I would like to find a more natural almond scent to use. (If you have any suggestions please let me know).\n\nI put the duped formula into the original Amande bottle and it sprays really well!",

    "body": "Hey all!! I had posted not too long ago requesting help finding a dupe for my now discontinued lip balm, the Bite Agave Lip Mask. I took recommendations and compromised on some of my wishlist for ingredients, as I realized no one else makes a balm with an identical ingredient list. I figured in case anyone else is struggling with replacing this, I'd share what I found. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It too got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. Its good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. Its a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. Its a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, its going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!!",

    "body": "I'm going to give some short reviews for some roll-on perfumes from Lovesick Witchery, including 2 customs. The only one depicted that I'm not reviewing is Sideshow, since I haven't had time to get to that one yet. Also keep in mind that I'm reviewing these all pretty fresh, so they could change a little later on. I'm also going to separate the reviews into General Catalogue (Lavender Cashmere, Angelic, Anesthetic, and the freebies Ghoulish) and Bespoke (custom ones named Oberon and Adisorn).\n\n\nGeneral Catalogue:\n\nLavender Cashmere: Lavender sugar, wrapped in fuzzy cashmeran.\nIt smells just like the description lets on. There's an herbal lavender mixed with sugar and a soft, fuzzy smell. I'm not well-acquainted with cashmeran notes, but I think it goes well with the lavender sugar. The whole thing gives off comfy sweater vibes to me and I like it.\nAbout an hour later, I can still smell it, though it may have gotten lighter (mind you, I'm testing this while still dealing with a cold). In general, it smells like a warm, fuzzy hug from something sweet.\n\nAngelic: Sparkling yuzu soda, white tea leaves, mint, apple blossom, white sage, cedarwood, and angelic musk.\nOnce it's on, it smells kind of fruity in a soft way (I think it's a mix of the yuzu, white tea, and apple blossom) and effervescent (not as bubbly as other soda or champagne scented perfumes, though, so I wouldn't recommend buying it solely on the sparkling soda mention). I can smell the mint a little, but it's not overpowering. Everything kind of gives a clean vibe overall to me (part of it is probably the angelic musk, since Lovesick Witchery describes that kind of note as aldehydic), so I'd categorize this as fresh and it's not especially sweet or anything like that. This one feels like a bit of a morpher, since I smell a different note up front practically every time I give it another sniff.\nAbout an hour later, it smells pretty much the same to me. Maybe lighter and slightly more apple blossom? I feel like this would be nice to retry in warmer weather, but it is nice.\n\nAnesthetic: Catnip, clary sage, chamomile tea, jasmine, violet, shea butter, and honeyed vanilla.\nI definitely smell the chamomile tea, shea butter, and honeyed vanilla. Some of these notes kind of tricked my nose for a moment into thinking of some chocolate chai that I like, but it's not really that. I can't say that I know what catnip smells like, but I think I also get the sage and florals. The vibe of this as I study it is warm, honey herbals to me. I feel like maybe if you like Lush stores, then this might be worth sampling.\nAbout an hour later, I mostly smell the shea butter. It's the lightest of all of the ones that tried, but I feel like sometimes that shea butter scent can really project. This one's probably the least \"my style\", but it's definitely not bad.\n\nGhoulish: Lemon, lavender, nutmeg, honey cakes, tonka bean, black tea, and milk.\nThis one was the freebies I got and wow. Smelling this is a blast of lavender lemon honey cakes with tea, just as described. I don't think my nose can really parse the notes as separate entities beyond that, but it doesn't really have to. Considering that I sometimes amp honey notes, I'd probably like to use this one more for spring than summer, but I will update in a while, like with the other scents, to see if the honey plays nice.\nAbout an hour later, I feel like the lemon and honey (the lemon in particular) have lightened up. Overall, this is another one I really like.\n\n\nBespoke:\n\nI'm going to point out quickly that these are both based on characters, so I tried to balance my requests to fit the inspiration with wearability. We talked about options on Etsy messages, but I ordered when slots were open over on the store website. I also added cursory sniff info to these and, if anyone is curious, I chose fractionated coconut oil as the carrier oil, since that's what I'm more familiar with (the usual for Lovesick Witchery's general catalogue is sweet almond oil).\n\nOberon: Caramel cider, hydrangea, leather, motor oil, tonka, oud, thunderstorm, benzoin, and black musk.\nCursory Sniff: I definitely smell the cider in there. Overall, a sweet and spicy vibe. Kind of dark, too, and I think I can smell some of the leather, thunderstorm, and oil that makes it kind of warm and metallic. I'm not as well-versed in some of the notes in this one, but I might get a better feel for it when I really try it out.\nWearing: It's actually wearable, thankfully. It's definitely different than what I would normally pick up, but I find it really interesting. The caramel cider and hydrangea give it a sweetness and I feel like some of the other notes are keeping the motor oil and thunderstorm in check. I wish I could be more articulate about some of these notes, but it makes me happy just to know that it smells pretty good.\nAbout an hour later, I think it's leaning more on the woodsy and musky notes. It's really pleasant overall. Sometimes I get a metallic scent that has to be the thunderstorm.\n\nAdisorn: Strawberry, cream, pandan leaves, sweater accord, tobacco, night air, snow musk, and steel.\nCursory Sniff: Sweet, cuddly, and a little cold. Definitely smelling that strawberry and cream in particular. I'm not as familiar with pandan leaves, but the listing of potential notes mentioned that it's sweetened with vanilla and coconut, so I think I'm picking that up. The sweater accord might be evening out the colder notes a bit?\nWearing: It has a sweet, foodie smell to it between the strawberry, cream, and pandan leaves. I think I can smell the sweater and night air as well. This perfume comes off as soft and dark to me.\nAbout an hour later, I think I smell more of the sweater and maybe the tobacco. There's still a little bit of sweetness, but it's more in the background. The snow musk seems to be there as well.",

I hope you love everything even more as they rest longer and have some time to settle! Not sure if you’ve ordered from them before but I found that after a few weeks with my rollerballs, I felt like the longevity improved a lot (at least on my skin, especially if I use an unscented lotion first). I also have a bespoke coming based on a character I made up so I’m wicked excited for it 😍 yours sound incredible!! \n\nI also got one with a motor oil note for my husband hehe, he’s a car guy so it just made sense. Glad to hear yours is wearable! I almost chose thunderstorm too for his but ended up going with lighthouse, salty sea spray on jagged rocks to balance some fiery notes. Though then my package got misdelivered and now idk if I’ll get the initial one I ordered with three bespokes lol, would be my luck that I screwed up my mailing address without even trying. I reordered everything and at this point if I ever get the first package then I’ll just use those for backups lmao 🥲 \n\nAnyway thank you so much for sharing your customs!! I get so excited to see what other people go with when they choose to create some with different perfume brands! When I was trying to decide which brand to get a custom perfume from, I barely saw any Lovesick bespoke reviews but the ones I did see were awesome so I really appreciate you adding to our little IMAM database on this topic 😍 can’t wait to share mine with you all!! This post has me so hyped to finally get mine",

    "body": "Let’s talk about it. And let's fix it. \n\nWe’re not talking trash on individuals or companies... we’re talking trash on the entire damn industry. \n\nIt’s broken. Beard care has become the most \"pick me\" industry I’ve ever experienced. Amateur hour is not just tolerated, it’s celebrated. Copycat companies flood the market daily, and their brand reps proudly make the case that experience doesn’t matter. That education is meaningless. It’s not just laughable anymore, it’s dangerous. Our full-time job has become correcting misinformation.\n\nAnd the proof is always in the pudding. *Every time* someone listens to this advice, whether they try something we’ve made or something crafted by any of the dozens of other brands doing it right, they rave about the night-and-day difference. **That tells us everything we need to know**. The game changes for every person who makes the switch, so let's change the whole damn game for everybody. \n\nLet’s be clear. This is not about promoting our brand. This is about lifting up *every single company* that formulates based on real science, backed by peer-reviewed data and clinical understanding. Because that exists. Those companies exist. They’re out there. And they deserve your attention. Don’t let anyone convince you otherwise just to maintain relevance and keep selling the same tired blends. \n\nWe’ve done the actual research. We've had every product we make independently lab tested against 20 - 30 of the top sellers on the market to ensure the highest content of bioavailable fatty acids. But, what we learned was even bigger: most of the industry has almost nothing in the way of bioavailable nutrition.\n\nAnd that led us to a conclusion:\n\n**Even a halfway decent homemade blend you can put together for around $3-5/oz at the grocery store will beat out 99% of the most popular beard oils on the market.**\n\nSo here’s one for you:\n\n50% grapeseed oil\n\n40% sweet almond oil\n\n10% castor oil\n\n10 drops of essential oil per ounce (pick your scent)\n\nDone. That blend offers fast absorption, long-term nourishment, improved elasticity, anti-inflammatory support, and better hydration regulation. Why? Because of its content of linoleic, oleic, stearic, and palmitic acids, all delivered through high-bioavailability triglycerides.\n\nIs it the best possible blend? No. But I promise you it's better than anything made by the dozens of brands most commonly recommended. This beats every one of them. \n\n***Above that*** sits the concept of scientific formulation, where we balance the lipid profile so that each fatty acid supports and reinforces the others. That’s 90% of what cosmetic chemistry actually is. Dialing in benefit. Reducing interference. Creating harmony for the highest level of long-term benefit possible. \n\nNothing beats a properly balanced scientific blend. That’s why we test everything. But it’s also why we promote and support so many other brands. There are companies out there using science, formulation knowledge, and clinical insight to change the game, and we’ll fight tooth and nail to make sure they aren’t erased by hype, misinformation, and marketing gimmicks. Also, don't ever let somebody tell you that you need to pay $50 for some \"luxury blend\". A well formulated cosmetic line should be right around $20 - $25. Anything more is bullsh*t. I don't care if they wax dip the bottle. \n\nLook, we get a lot of negativity directed at us for shaking up the status quo, but just ask someone who’s taken the ride. They’ll tell you honestly. We’re not out here trashing individuals, we’re building a revolution. It’s inevitable that we’ll piss off some folks along the way. They're fighting to avoid having to change. So be it. We ignore it. Because those of us who have been doing this for over a decade owe it to our customers to lead with integrity. \n\nAgain, this isn’t just about our brand at all, so save the hate. There are dozens of companies killing it, and we’re proud to recommend them all. Holler for recs. If you appreciate this kind of advice, give this post an upvote, because it's guaranteed to attract the negativity of the industry shills. \n\n*UPDATE: They're here! Rather than refuting the science with an educated opinion, they're going to downvote every positive comment. Passive aggression rather than growth or healthy debate. That's what we're up against. They're just proving our point! ❤️*\n\nBeard Strong.\n\n-Brad",

        "body": "I want to preface this by admitting that I've never used any of your products Brad. But what you say is 100% on point. \n\nThose of you pointing out that he's using his company's reddit account are missing the point. If an average drive-by account came and posted this information you'd blow it off as them not knowing what they're talking about. To me, using his company's account carries more credibility than just a random account. \n\nI'll also admit that it's a double-edged sword. He can say he's not promoting his company all he wants, but the optics of using a company account to post this information is self promotion\nThat's just the way it is and I'm not sure that there's any way around that. \n\nBut there's a difference in promoting his company and advertising his company. Differentiating yourself from competitors is not really advertising.  But there's literally no way for him to make this post without doing so. The only other option would be to use an account not connected to the company. But then nobody is going to take it seriously. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I'm far from a beard newbie. I've had a beard of varying length for like 12 or 13 years I think. I've done the short business beard, the chest-length long covid beard (because I couldn't get to my barber for a proper trim), then back to a business beard because I got tired of wearing a mask with the long beard, and settled on a longer medium length.\n\nAnd over the years I've used A LOT of different products. I have a shaved head but my wife says I have more haircare products than she does. And she's 100% right. It's the only hair I have, so I have to take care of it. At first, I didn't. But eventually I picked up whatever beard products I found on Amazon, then my ADHD took over and I became obsessed with the topic and went down a deep YouTube rabbit hole. I've used cheap stuff, expensive stuff, products YouTubers review and promote, I even found out that one of my coworkers has worked with 2 different beard companies so I checked out their stuff.\n\nAnd just today I literally ran into exactly what you're talking about here Brad. I placed an order for a product I'm running low on, and after checking out I got a \"survey\" asking which content creators I'd like to see the company work with next. My response was \"none of them. I don't want to see another paid promotion on YouTube. You send a guy a product and of course he's going to give it a good review. It's an unconscious bias. How about spotlight testimonials from everyday Joe's, the every man, tradesmen, truck drivers, the boys in blue, their brothers in the FD, the office worker, the gym bro who freshen up after a workout, the dad who gets his daughter's approval of any product he uses, or places the opinion of his wife above others.\"\n\nBrad - to the content of your post, you listed a few oils, but for me I need more than oil for my beard. As I understand it, the oil is mostly for the skin underneath the beard. But I need more of a butter or balm for shaping and hold. My beard grows wavy in the front, and once it gets longer the sideburns start looking like Wolverine. I have to have something to hold it in place without looking heavy with product. I also use a thicker balm or small amount of wax for my mustache. I've thought about trying my hand at my own product, but I think adding holding ingredients puts it well outside of my ability. \n\nI know you probably can't put names out there, but I'd be curious about the companies you think are doing it the right way. That way I can see what they have for my situation.",

Started with all the Cremo stuff, so when I really started taking it seriously about 2 years ago, that's where I started again. Then I got a few from a couple different companies at the brick and mortar stores and then online. Some had such off synthetic smells, always varying consistency, and some just felt like I was just slathering perfumed cooking oil on my face and calling it a day.\n\nBut the worst part was...my beard just wasn't getting nicer. So, after the company I had decided to go all in did a few things I didn't really care for (Fake, AI generated product reviews for unreleased products being one of them), I decided to start anew and look for products again from different companies. I used this subreddit for some guidance.\n\nNow, I have used six different companies. Roughneck being one of them because of these posts. Are they marketing posts simply because they come from a company account? I think so. Do I think they're still needed here? Yes, I do. Because I genuinely think they're helpful. If they were just posted by a random person, they'd contain the same information, but I wouldn't know if I could take their word on anything. That's just the day and age we live in.\n\nSo, I'm sure you can block, downvote, ignore, etc these posts if you'd like to. But I really do have to tell you from personal, unbiased experience (I didn't like every product I bought from them)...this company does know what they're talking about, so we should take these posts as they are and that's it.

Had one that felt foamy in a way once, don't know how, but it just felt terrible in the beard aha.\n\nExpanding the search overseas there were definitely many better ones, but still using the same ingredients. Some were just done better than the others and still worked well in the beard so didn't notice any huge impacts with them. \n\nBut after gaining some better knowledge and trying products that actually used different ingredients and was done right, the difference was definitely night and day.

    "body": "**[Lush Ultrabland](http://www.lushusa.com/Ultrabland/02749,en_US,pd.html), $29.95 for 3.5 oz available in Lush stores and online**\n\nThe packaging describes it as an \"ultra effective, ultra gentle face cleanser,\"  which is a fair assessment.  It's a balm cleanser primarily composed of emulsified sweet almond oil and rose water with beeswax and honey added for additional moisturizing power (but mostly, bells and whistles).\n\nI bought this on a whim in early December to use as a morning cleanse and wound up liking it so much that I haven’t used another cleanser since. A little goes a long way - I *just* rebought, meaning I got 4 - 4.5 months of twice daily use out of one jar.  I apply one or two pea-sized dabs to dry skin and massage it all over my face before removing it with a hot damp cloth.   At night I take a little more time with it and occasionally get grits.  Ultrabland goes on smooth and creamy with an inoffensive, very faint, honey-smell that doesn’t linger.   It effectively removes makeup and sunscreen and leaves my skin soft and cleansed, but with no “tight” feeling.\n\nAs much as I love this product, I have to describe it as being for everyone and no one at the same time.  On the one hand, it is gentle and non-stripping in a way that makes it effective for oily skins and dry skins alike.  But - it’s not inexpensive.  It’s *basically* sweet almond oil, and one could get the benefit of Ultrabland using OCM.  I don’t like the texture of oil on my face as a regular everyday thing and it feels messy to me.  Ultrabland doesn’t feel like oil and it doesn’t run, which also makes it convenient for travel, if you share my fear of liquids opening up in an overnight bag.  If the *idea* of OCM appeals to you, but the vicissitudes of selecting an oil and getting that liquidy goodness all of your face does not, Ultrabland may be an ideal product for you.  It *does* contain parabens and essential oils for fragrance (Iris extract and Rose Absolute), so if you’re avoiding parabens and fragrance, this is not for you.\n\nIn all likelihood, I will buy it again.  Out of curiosity, I’d like to investigate the Banila balms, but with shipping I’d be back at the per ounce of Ultrabland, which I like a lot in the first place, so for the foreseeable, Ultrabland will be my cleanser of choice.\n\nConclusion: Ultrabland.  Does what it says on the tin.\n\n*Ingredients: Almond Oil (Prunus dulcis) , Rose Water (Rosa centifolia) , Beeswax (Cera alba) [rated 0-2 for acne and irritant on Cosdna], Honey (Mel) , Fresh Iris Extract (Iris florentina) , Glycerine , Rose Absolute (Rosa damascena) , Tincture of Benzoin (Styrax benzoin) , Methylparaben , Propylparaben*\n",

I thought I had got it a couple of times, but I always found something wrong with my routine, and my face would definitely tell me.\n\nJust a small list of things I've tried: mostly all drugstore brands- Clearasil, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, Cerave, Pond's, Aveeno...also! Murad, shit load of Korean brands my mom gave me, Dermalogica, Avalon Organics....I'm pretty sure I'm missing more than half the list, haha. \n\nAs the title says, my top three problems are dehydrated skin (just moisturizer? Let me give you tons of flakes and redness!), oiliness beyond control, and lots of acne. I always thought I hit the bad skin jackpot because I seemed to have everything that was bad, haha. I finally found that using a gentle (and I mean really, really gentle) cleanser has helped tremendously! That paired with good moisturizers and consistency has helped a lot :) so this is my current routine:\n\n- Cleanse with GoW Fall into my Pumpkin (I seriously recommend this! I got a sample pack of this, green tea/Shea cleanser the gentle version, and gentle cleansing gel. The green tea cleanser was a lot more drying than I thought it would be, which sucked because I thought this would be the best one due to reviews. I haven't even used the gel one because the pumpkin one is so freaking awesome!)\n- Lightly dry face\n- Apply Clinique DDMG\n- Apply Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid thingy\n- Apply meadowfoam oil (oh my gaaaaawd guys this is SO GOOD!!)\n- Apply Boscia SPF50 sunscreen (this was honestly just a splurge. It works great, but it doesn't seem any better than drugstore ones.) or if night, apply a thin layer of Aquaphor!!\n\nJust another thing about the meadowfoam oil- other oils just didn't seem to absorb, which is why I ordered this in my sample pack (the reviews...). I also got sweet almond oil, which isn't as great, and squalene, which doesn't seem to do anything. I've used jojoba and argan in the past- jojoba made me too oily and didn't absorb, argan was too heavy...\n\nI just thought I would share with you lovely, lovely people.

    "body": "I hope we could post photos here so you can see the drastic improvement on my hands after 72 hours. I didn't have any skin issues when I was younger, not sensitive to anything but for the past years I've had eczema on and off especially on my hands. Tried so many ways to alleviate the itch, tried creams which worked before but now it didn't seem to work anymore. When it gets itchy, I run my hands through my long hair to \"scratch\" it cause when I use my nails, a wound is bound to come out. This time, it has gotten so bad, the lines on my fingers have opened and my left palm seemed to have a map of a continental eczema on it and all affected parts have thickened. I couldn't close my hand into a fist without pain bec of dryness and washing my hands is also a pain cause I have more than 10 open eczematous wounds on my 2 hands. So I researched on natural methods of curing it and came upon NEEM oil. There's a YT tutorial on how to make a Neem balm  but I don't have the other ingredients like shea butter, cocoa butter, sweet almond oil and castor oil so I just ordered pure Neem oil.  Mind you, it has a strong pungent smell. I mixed maybe 6 drops with a little hand cream in a small container, and applied it. The thick skin started falling off 12 hours after applying (not washing it off). Now 72 hours later, all of the 11 open eczematous wounds have almost closed. At this rate, I think  in 4 more days, I won't have a trace of eczema on my hands anymore. Btw, Neem balm is also the cure for scabies and is a good way to alleviate mosquito itch, better than calamine. Make sure to dilute it first with a carrier oil, a hand cream or make your own Neem balm yourself based on YT videos. I just wanted to share this here because I know how distracting, embarrassing, frustrating and annoying it feels to suffer from this. God bless everyone.",

    "body": "To all the acne/skin issues sufferers, let's share notes!  \n(about me: I have fairly sensitive, \"congested\" skin with hormonal triggered acne, and these are the things I wish I knew sooner).\n  \n1. If you can have insurance/can afford it, SEE A DERMATOLOGIST.  These people actually know what they are talking about, can provide you with samples of medicines, prescriptions and knowledge about what will make your skin healthy! Additionally, if you think your acne is more hormonal, see your regular doctor and potentially an endocrinologist.  A lot of the time, skin issues are more than just surface problems.   \n\n2. When it comes to skincare, less is more.  If you are going to use some sort of medicated treatment on your face on a daily basis, you probably want to use the most gentle face wash possible.  Some suggestions include: Aquanil, Cetaphil, Purpose.  Basically, you don't want to be irritating your face with extra nonsense if you are going to be medicating it otherwise.  It took me forever to realize that I was making my skin way worse by adding on more stuff to my skincare routine.  Pare back your routine to the bare minimum of things that work, and then DON'T CHANGE IT unless it stops working!     \n\n3. Get rid of alcohol based toners.  Seriously, toners seem awesome, they make your face tingle, but they also make your face WAY more greasy, so you think you need more toner.  You do not need toner!  I have heard that alcohol-free witch hazel is nice to use, but haven't tried it myself.  \n\n4.  If you have a lot of facial hair, plucking can be a dangerous thing - you are essentially opening a tiny hole in your face to let in bacteria, which can and will cause acne.  Make sure you are either cleaning thoroughly, or try an alternate method for hair removal like laser (warning: expensive!).  \n\n5. Sunscreen/moisturizer!  Definitely get a good, basic moisturizer with sunscreen in it.  Use it everyday!\n\n6.  Eye makeup removal: Use oil!  You can use one or a combination of olive oil, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, coconut oil and other similar oils with a q-tip or cotton ball, and use it to swab off eye makeup.  It works wonderfully and has the benefit of being really good for moisturizing the skin around your eyes.  \n\n7.  Allergies.  It took me a really long time to realize that I was having skin issues because I was allergic to certain ingredients in skin products.  Sometimes you never can figure out what is irritating you, but sometimes it's obvious - for me, it's soy based ingredients and the rest is a mystery.  This goes back to the less is more theory - if things seem to be getting worse, cut back on products and start over to try to figure it out.  Also, it is possible that food allergies can trigger acne.    Dairy and wheat/gluten are pretty common offenders, and I know that vitamins with fish oil or DHAs make me breakout immediately.     \n\n8. Exfoliation.  Depending on what treatment you may or may not be using, exfoliation is great!  If you are using retinoids or benzoyl peroxides, or whatever else, you may want to be careful with over exfoliating, since these chemicals will cause exfoliation on their own.  If you don't use those types of chemicals, physical exfoliation is a great way to slough off dead skin and keep your pores clean and clear.  You hear awesome stuff about the Clarisonic (a spinning brush thing), but that is expensive! There are a million cheap knockoffs of it that will do pretty much the same thing.  I have the Olay version of this and I love it!  A more low tech and even cheaper way to exfoliate is with a [Buf Puf](http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Buf-Puf/Home/).    \n\n9.  The Heavy Hitters!! Note that many of these products can make your skin itchy/dry for maybe up to a week when you first start using them, but it's often worth it!  Let's discuss the various treatments and what they do for skin:  \n\n* AHA - alpha hydroxy acid.  Well-known AHAs include lactic acid, glycolic acid, malic acid and citric acid. They are water-soluble and are really good at exfoliating damaged, dry skin.  They unclogs pores, and actually help to moisturize your skin, plus you can use them when you are pregnant.  Note that it can sting a little.  \n\n* BHA - Beta hydroxy acid. AKA Salicylic Acid - also why crushed up aspirin helps zits (it's the same ingredient).  Similar to AHAs, but BHAs are better able to penetrate oily, blemished skin and pores.  Note that you should not use this during pregnancy!  \n\n* Benzoyl Peroxide - Benzoyl peroxide works as a peeling agent. It increases skin turnover, clearing pores and reducing the bacterial count (specifically P. acnes) as well as acting directly as an antimicrobial.  Will bleach fabrics, so pillows beware!  This is often used VERY effectively in conjunction with other treatments, like salicylic acid or with retinoids.  Note that you should probably not use this during pregnancy, but some doctors say it is ok.  \n\n* Retinoids - These are chemical compounds based on vitamin A. There are three \"generations\" of them, so you get the first generation retinoids: which include retinol, retinal, tretinoin (retinoic acid, Retin-A), isotretinoin, and alitretinoin; the second generation retinoids: which include etretinate and its metabolite acitretin; and finally the third generation retinoids: which include tazarotene, bexarotene and Adapalene.  These guys speed up cell turnover and strip the top layer off your face, making you look glowy and lovely and zit and wrinkle free. Love this stuff!  You can't use this when you are pregnant.  \n\n* Oral antibiotics.  There are a million different versions of these, and they can be magical, but they aren't great because your body will start to build immunity to them, and that's not good.  I guess certain types of acne are more about the infection under the skin rather than what is going on at the the surface, so these fight acne from the inside.  If you have a special event for which you NEED a perfect face, see the dermatologist and ask for these!  I don't think they are great for long term use, but they can really knock down a bad skin condition and give you a good starting point for other treatments.  Can't be used during pregnancy!\n\nThere are probably more, but these are the main methods you usually get with the professionals.  Note that I mentioned the pregnancy stuff.  This is mostly due to the fact that I am pregnant and had to recently readjust my whole skincare routine because I can't use my precious epiduo (combo of benzoyl peroxide and adapalene), which is really what spurred this whole post.  \n\nIn conclusion, dealing with problem skin sucks, so hopefully this is helpful to someone out there!  Please everyone feel free to add and correct!!  ",

Now I don't know how accurate this is, but my esthetician went to school for this and I trust her and started doing it.

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Thank you for the reviews.\n\nI've seen FMC go upto 35%off on kindlife & 30%off on their own website.\n\nEdit - I have fine 2a wavy hair, & medium porosity from what I can tell. I'm hair dumb tbh. I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture. So sm1 with Frizzy or dry hair would need other more rich / moisturizing products.\n\nThe leave in cream & mousse are my more used products, I haven't quite figured out how to use the gel properly yet.",

    "body": "Alright, this is going to be long. I went into a tad more detail this time (mostly in what the customs were based on) and all of the customs were ordered with fractionated coconut oil as the carrier oil. I assume the freebie, FemFragLab, is probably with the usual sweet almond oil.\n\nNot a Bride: Moonflower, lavender, hemlock, oakmoss, cedarwood, leather, spiced patchouli, and black vanilla.\nInspiration: A character-based perfume and said character is from a visual novel (an outdated demo at the moment). This one is for a vampire named Dexter and he's from The Eye's Embrace. I'm very curious about this guy since he absolutely does not want to be in the situation he's in as a vampiric \"bride\" (don't know the story there yet, but I sure want to and I share his hatred of Bram, the vampire cult leader who clearly put him in that situation). Basically, I wanted to give him a pretty, herbal scent, but with a masculine side since he's by his own admission not a bride. The moonflower was mostly a choice that I thought would be vampire in a very unconventional way (not wine, dirt, blood/copper, black or red roses, etc.) and the hemlock is for some extra poison. Most of the other notes are ones I thought would be fun for the overall effect. I actually had omitted the lavender note before spitballing it (I like to consult before finalizing an idea, since why not), but Rachel had the same idea in that regard and I think offering that as a potential note ended up being a good idea. I didn't want it to be too floral, but I don't think it will be.\nCursory Sniff: So pretty! It has a spiced smell to it that I really like (definitely the patchouli and I think I smell the leather there, too). Seems to fit the intended concept.\nWearing: Gorgeous! Smells like standing next to the prettiest guy in the world or something. I smell lavender in particular and there's something almost a little cold in there, but it's not a cold scent overall. There's a lot of nice herbal smells in general and I can pick out the leather and patchouli.\nAbout an hour later, I can smell the perfume on my wrists while typing down notes on my phone. Smelling it closer, I feel like the lavender has faded out for the hemlock, which is a little more bitter but not unpleasant. Overall, I find this perfume to be cozy.\n\nMy Sweet Housemate: Fabric softener, carrot, lettuce, rice milk, tonka, black linen, cashmere woods, and copper.\nInspiration: This is another character-based one and said character is from a comedic indie visual novel called My Sweet! Housemate (which is where the name came from). His name is Seung-Min and he's a cannibal, so this one is Quirky. According to the dev of the game, he has a tendency of smelling like fabric softener from regular clothing laundering to get those pesky blood stains out (hence the fabric softener, black linen, and copper). Since the game has a small cooking minigame, I also wanted some carrot, lettuce, and rice milk. The tonka and cashmere woods are a fun little extra, in a woodsy fragrance sort of way.\nCursory Sniff: Very clean with a little earthiness from the veggies. It's really pleasant and it's something unique, as far as fragrances I've tried.\nWearing: Yup. It's clean laundry and earthy veggies. I think I also smell some of the woodsiness of the tonka and cashmere woods in the background. That earthiness is very different from what I usually wear, but it's pleasant when mixed in with the cleaner notes. I don't really parse the copper, but I don't find that to be a bad thing, since I would prefer that note to be light.\nAbout an hour later, the whole thing has gotten much softer. It's mostly a little whiff of fabric softener and probably also the black linen. The whole thing is soft, musky laundry with a hint of woods and vegetables. I'm interested to see how this one will change over time.\n\nSeascape: Pear gelato, french vanilla, sea salt caramels, heliotrope, plumeria, seashore accord, driftwood, and sandalwood.\nInspiration: This one's just one I picked out for myself instead of using a character inspiration. I wanted something summery, so chose some notes with inspiration from Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa '62. Pear gelato sounds really good and that's the biggest distinction, followed by some of the ocean stuff.\nCursory Sniff: Pear! Lots of sweet deliciousness with a bit of an ocean vibe. Just what I was hoping for.\nWearing: This one is strong! Pear gelato is definitely the big thing right now. I think I smell the caramels and seashore under it. Probably also the flowers and vanilla? I feel like this one's a bit of the morpher because smelling it again gives me more of those sea salt caramels.\nAbout an hour later, there's still some of the sweet stuff and flowers, but I feel like it's settled more into the seashore and wood now. I really like this one!\n\nFemFragLab: Cardamom, vanilla, buttercream, marshmallow, pistachio, tonka, black amber, and musk.\nCursory Sniff: My nose registers this as a vanilla pudding with some spiciness to it. Very promising and I'm curious about that.\nWearing: DESSERT. Sweet vanilla frosting and marshmallows with some cardamom and pistachio. I think the black amber and musk deepen it up a bit, which is nice. I'd be worried someone might want to eat me when I smell like this. lol\nAbout an hour later, I still smell some of those sweeter notes, but I think they lightened up for the black amber to take over. It's alright, though I probably would've traded that note for something else.",

    "body": "My skin loves honey. It does not care if it is raw and thick or thin and filtered; it makes it glowy, soft, tones the pimples down and fades my red marks. \n\nBut I forgot about it and discovered that benzoyl peroxide is what keeps me 99% clear after trying out so many things. And I only use it for 5 to 30 minutes before rinsing it all out, so that it does not interact with my routine. After that,  I can slather my moisturizer freely without it balling up/ not soaking in and without worrying about getting BP on my eyes, lips on top of it bleaching all of my stuff.\n\nI remembered that last year I used to put one part of honey to two parts of my aloe vera based toner (Babaria brand, if it matters) in a separate bottle. I would then apply it to my face with a cotton ball before bed. It was a little sticky but not nearly as much as a honey face mask. I could sleep without worrying about waking up with my face glued to the pillow and insects coming for me (I live in a very “green” area. If I heat up something sweet all of the insects come by to say hi lol).\n\nWhen I finished the toner I would mix it with some Nivea in the white tub and it would work just as well. My acne was a lot better but what I liked most was what it did to my complexion. And it was way more practical than using it as a face mask. Also, because of the stickiness, I found that rubbing pure honey was a bit irritating for my skin.\n\nI don’t advise using it under foundation/powder because every time I tried it balled up and was very sticky, it made my skin look flaky for some reason. The best time for me is before bedtime or at least not under makeup.\n\nToday I thought I would use honey because it’s been a long time. I mixed one teaspoon of it with a teaspoon and a half of my moisturizer (allantoin, vitamin e and sweet almond oil based, pharmaceutical, if that matters) and put it in an empty small jar. It mixed perfectly, and applies smoothly on my face. Dries into a dewy finish but not greasy looking, the stickiness is minimal. It’s been two hours and my face already looks soothed.\n\nI’ve never had any problem with it going bad when mixed with commercial products; I think they contain enough preservatives so it does not really oxidize. I only mix enough to last me a few weeks. \n\nIt does not matter if it is raw and thick, it will eventually dissolve in a toner and it will mix with moisturizer (I mix with a cotton bud or my fingers).\n\nFor me, this has been the best way to enjoy some honey infused skincare without the tackiness/texture problem and I can let it do its magic for hours.\n",

    "body": "So I really wanted to make my own DIY shaving cream recipe, but the only ones I could find were either shaving \"foams\", or weren't the kind of formulation I wanted. \n\nI was inspired by [this](https://www.humblebeeandme.com/sleepy-time-lavender-benzoin-lotion/) recipe from Humblebee and Me, where she made a dupe of the Lush \"Sleepy\" lavender lotion. I compared \"Sleepy\" and \"Dirty\" on the Lush website, and found out that they have some similar ingredients. So I used Humblebee and Me's recipe as a template, but I added and changed several things to make the formula more authentic to the \"Dirty\" shaving cream. I also doubled the amounts of ingredients. \n\nThe recipe if anyone wants it:\n\nMakes 8 oz\n\n**Water phase:**\n\n150 g (70%) distilled water\n\n4 g (2%) hydrolyzed oat protein \n\n2 g (1%) colloidal oatmeal\n\n4 g (2%) glycerin\n\n1 g (0.5%) triethanolamine \n\n**Oil phase:**\n\n10 g (5%) emulsifying wax\n\n20 g (10%) sweet almond oil \n\n4 g (2%) unrefined shea butter\n\n10 g (5%) safflower oil\n\n4 g (2%) stearic acid\n\n**Cooldown ingredients:**\n\n1 g (0.5%) benzoin resin\n\n0.2 g (0.1%) cedarwood essential oil\n\n1 g (0.5%) liquid germall plus (preservative) \n\nCombine the water phase ingredients in a beaker, and combine the oil phase ingredients in another beaker. Place them in a hot water bath for thirty minutes. \n\nAfter thirty minutes, add the water phase ingredients into the oil phase. Using an immersion blender, blend in short bursts (so the mixture doesn't fly everywhere) for two minutes. Then, leave it to cool for ten minutes. After ten minutes, blend for another two minutes. Leave to cool for fifteen more minutes, then blend for another two minutes. Finally, leave the mixture to cool completely for 30-60 minutes.\n\nThen, add the preservative and essential oils! Mix it up and put it in your container, and you're done! \n\nMine ended up looking like [this ](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZWtMarJ). On another note, does anybody know of a brand of label/marker I can use that won't bleed/peel off in the shower? \n\nAt first, the scent of the benzoin and cedarwood oil was really strong, but it faded to a more mild scent after a couple of days. You can use a different blend of essential oils if you like!\n\nI just wanted to share my recipe! I hope someone can get some use from it :)",

    "body": "Hi Everyone! I have recently taken it upon myself to purchase and review body oils from many many different indie brands. I originally was going to post this as one big post but I have gathered so many oils and have so many opinions on them that I think it's best to break it up a little bit into a few different posts as I go along. If there's any oils you want to see reviewed, please let me know and I will do my best to get my hands on some. \n    \n**About my skin:** I have very dry, eczema prone skin. I have had psoriasis in the past but do not currently. I am sensitive on the inside of my elbows and behind my knees where the skin is thin.   \n  \n**What I like:** You will notice I prefer a bit of a thicker oil. I know this is not always everyones preference so I have also reviews some thinner oils. I try all the oils in the same way: Coating my body head to toe and sleeping with the oil on my skin. In the morning, my skin will either feel adequately moisturized  or still a bit dry.\n    \n**Sucreabeille (4oz = 8.00 USD, +/- 2.00 USD/oz)**  \n**Body Oil** (The Listing Attic: spiced apple cider, maple sugar, Kentucky bourbon)  \n**Ingredients:** Sunflower Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance/Essential Oil.  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** This is a good one. I love a true oil to wear, but want something that absorbs quickly. This fits that bill, coating my skin nicely but absorbing in about 15/20 minutes. Skin was very soft in the morning when I woke up. Wish this came in a dropper or spray (it’s one of those caps where you push the back down and it pops up to dispense, this formula is thick enough that you have to squeeze the bottle a bit, it won’t run out on its own).   **Also a note, the owner of Sucreabeille has moved her house blends to be their own brand now. Sucreabeille still exists but is used for her copycat / dupe scents. Her new brand “Hexennacht” carries this scent, and from what I can tell the same formula of body oil (ingredients list is the same).**  \n**Scent:** Ooooh, she’s a boozy one! Off the bat, out of the bottle, I get strong apple bourbon. On the skin, it’s a really even combination of all 3 elements, very balanced. I like it a lot, but I don’t think I’d wear it as a perfume. Really nice scent for Fall / Winter. Nothing left on my skin in the morning after sleeping with this on.  \n  \n**Exoskeletons (1oz = 24.00 USD, +/- 24.00 USD/oz)**  \n**Skin Elixir** (Tobacco: A balanced blend of sweetness and smoke. Blackened spices, deep dark vanilla, sweet resins, and charred wood. Smells like mahogany, like brass, like bookshelves filled with e.e. cummings, like a jukebox singing the blues.)  \n**Ingredients:** jojoba oil, fractionated coconut oil, rosehip oil, castor oil, coq10, alpha lipoic acid, essential oil blend, vitamin e, infused with organic cloves.   \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I do like this formula as far as moisture and application. It goes on very nicely, is easy to spread, and I credit this product with turning my rough elbows baby soft in one application. This does not sink in as quickly as the Sucreabeille, in fact I think it’s the thickest oil I’ve tried so far. The only reason I won’t repurchase is because of the price. Of course, this has the nicest packaging out of everything, imo, which explains probably a lot of the higher cost.  \n**Scent:** Very strong. I believe this is a polarizing scent as although I love it, I have made a few people smell it who were either equally appreciative or a little bit revolted. This is mainly a strong clove. If I put this on before bed, the next day when I come home from work my entire room still smells of cloves.   \n  \n**Solstice Scents (4oz = 16.00 USD, +/- 4.00 USD/0z)**  \n**Burnishing Glacé** (Jack and the Devil: Jack & The Devil is part trick, part treat and all autumn delight. A blend of sugared golden pumpkin, spices, oakmoss, sweet vanilla, aged patchouli essential oil, and dried brown tobacco leaves [absolute]. )  \n**Ingredients:** Cyclomethicone NF, Fragrance and / or essential oil(s), Argan Oil, Rice Bran Oil  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I just wish this was more hydrating. It’s a nice, very light spray. I prefer to spray into my hand and then rub into skin as I find spraying directly results in some waste when the spray doesn’t hit your skin directly. This would be a better formula for summer, when my skin is not as dry. I like this for hair as well, but I don’t find the scent lingers in hair as much as it does on skin. I will most likely use this as a bath oil, which I will follow up with something thicker.  If you prefer a dry oil, that will absorb completely very quickly, this oil is for you.   **I do want to mention that I did have a little active eczema on the inside of elbow when using this, and it did sting a bit. Not enough that I washed it off, not enough that I stopped using it, but it did. This is something that Solstice Scents warns of on their website, since this is a spicy fragrance. I will continue to use it, but if you suffer from eczema or Psoriasis, I would take note.**   \n**Scent:** Scent is very strong on this one. Lasts nicely on the skin (though not in hair, for me), and this is one of my favourite indie scents for fall. Spicy, sweet, a little gourmand, a little masculine. Can smell it very faintly on my skin the next day, if applied before bed.  \n  \n**Cocoa Pink Silky Soft Body Oil (Greasy formula) (2 oz=5.80 USD, +/- 2.90 USD/oz)**\n(Winchester House Kitchen: The distinct aroma of autumn in the Winchester house kitchen with notes of aged oak, fresh baked pumpkin pie, 5 fold orange essential oil coated in the warm essence of light muscovado sugar, fresh ginger, sticky gobs of benzoin, warm buttery caramel simmering on the stovetop and just the barest hint of clove)  \n**Ingredients:** Sweet Almond Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Fragrance oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Olive Squalene, Jojoba Oil, Rice Bran Oil (greasy formula), Avocado Oil (greasy formula).  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I reaaaaaally like this formula you guys. As soon as I started using it I thought to myself “THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT”. This one definitely has to be sprayed into your hand because it just comes out as kind of a glop, not a spray. NBD because that’s how I apply them anyways. Really moisturizing, soaked in after about 10-15 minutes, and I woke up and my skin was soooo nice and soft. When I finish up all of these body oils, this is one I will definitely repurchase, in a few different scents.  \n**Scent:** Not at all what I expected! I kind of thought this was going to smell similar to Cinderella’s Carriage, based on the pumpkin, sugar, etc. but I barely get any sweetness at all. I get mainly ginger and aged oak (HONESTLY, I kind of get “recently polished wood furniture”) and when I woke up the next morning the slightest hint of caramel (could be in my head). Never got any orange. I don’t love it but I don’t hate it, and it doesn’t really linger so that’s fine.  \n\nWhew! Let me know if you have any questions about these scents or formulas. I have a lot more reviews to come: Epically Epic, Queen Bee, Alchemic Muse, Witch Baby... and some more Cocoa  Pink! Let me know if there are any formulas you would like to see me compare :)\n\n\n**Edit: Some formatting**",

    "body": "I know this won't work for everyone, but for me, simplifying my hair routine has been SO helpful. \n\nSo I have always had extremely dry, frizzy hair. It's a bit wavy, so I know that is normal to a degree, but nothing I did would help. I did curly girl method (no sulfates or silicones), products with sulfates and silicones, super moisturizing products, hair masks, serums, deep conditioners, you name it. Nothing worked, and it fact, made my hair worse. I knew my thyroid and blood levels were fine, so I wasn't concerned medically, I just couldn't seem to get my hair right. \n\nThen I was diagnosed with chronic migraines, and in an effort to eliminate any possible triggers, I decided to ditch as many fragrances as I could. I got a simple drugstore shampoo and conditioner with the mildest fragrance I could find, and switched all my leave in products and masks for nothing but plain, unscented sweet almond oil from the health food section of my grocery store. \n\nAnd my hair completely changed! It's so much shinier, softer, less tangly, and way easier to manage. I actually finally like my hair, and I didn't have to spend a million dollars on products. Yay! \n\n(Also, if anyone has any good recommendations for fragrance free shampoo and conditioner that don't cost an arm and I leg, I'd love to hear them!)",

I tried Kristin Ess but found their shampoo to be drying and their conditioner not to be hydrating enough. At the moment, I use Nizoral Ketaconazole shampoo, which is pretty strong of a scent, but I settled for the hair lengthening qualities of ketaconazole. For conditioner, I found a winner in Aveeno Curly Kids Conditioner. It’s definitely still mildly scented, but it’s not an overwhelming smell and doesn’t linger at all after washing. Still looking for the perfect fragrance free shampoo, because they tend to be too drying or not cleansing enough, but this will do for now. Definitely look into baby/kids products, I feel we have much more luck there in terms of gentle scents, hypoallergenic scent, anything that’s not aggressively strong.",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have accumulated a great deal of different shampoos from various indie companies throughout my time here and I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on them!\n\nSince everyone's hair is different, your experiences might differ from mine, so just keep that in mind! For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

    "body": "If you suffer when the humidity drops this low, as I do, here are some helpful tips.\n\nThe two most obvious things: drink water and use a humidifier. I use a Honeywell Quiet Comfort cool moisture humidifier. Distilled water eliminates that white dust that some humidifiers generate. If you find the area immediately around the humidifier gets damp, set it on a towel. Use white vinegar to daily clean the humidifier tank and reservoir. Most people feel comfortable at about 40-60% humidity. I'm from the coast so I prefer it around 60-70%.\n\nNose bleeds: try coating the insides of your nostrils with a vegetable oil. I use EVOO.\n\nDry lips: use a lip mask. I like the Laniege Lip Sleeping Mask.\n\nDry eyes: gel eye drops last longer than regular eye drops. I use Blink Gel Tears Lubricating Eye Drops and keep a bottle with me everywhere: in my purse, at my desk, by my bed, etc. A warm compress several times a day helps, too.\n\nDry throat/cough: cough drops, hard candies, tea. I like Traditional Medicinals Organic Throat Coat tea and their organic cough drops.\n\nDry skin: consider using body oil right after you shower, before you dry off. Rub it right into your wet skin. I use sweet almond oil with a few drops of vanilla essential oil added, for fragrance. But don't use your nice towels to dry off! I use a cheap washcloth to dry off after applying body oil. You can use and launder the washcloth a few times but eventually you'll have to throw it out. For a nighttime face moisturizer I like 100% rosehip oil and I use Eucerin hand lotion as needed during the day.\n\nDry hair: the ends of my hair *really* dry out this time of year. I have long hair so before I go to bed I lightly coat the last 6\" with jojoba oil. Then I braid it, wrap the bottom 6\" in plastic wrap (so the oil doesn't get on my pillow and sheets) and secure it with ponytail holders at the top and bottom so the plastic doesn't slide off. In the morning I shampoo it out. If you have thick hair you can use a few drops of jojoba on it to keep it moisturized during the day (I have fine hair so I can't do this without it looking greasy). \n\nSomething else that might help with dry hair and skin is to use a water filter system for your home or at least on your shower head. I use an Aquasana AQ-4100 filter on my shower head. Remember to replace the filter regularly. \n \nAnyone else have tips?",

    "body": "👍 Derma B Repair Cream Wash: very good fragrance free body wash. I'm sensitive and sometimes I need a blank canvas for skincare. Will probably rebuy when the price is appropriate. \n\n👍 Megababe Le Tush: I probably won't need to rebuy, because these are so often GWP in Ulta's stock lol. Probably a coupon only buy for me. \n\n👍 Laneige Cica Sleeping Mask: snice. Not sure it's a rebuy soon, as I seem to need more potent moisturizers at present as I now use azelaic three times a week or so. Maybe this is a product to revisit next summer. \n\n😍 MAC Fix+: I love it. It's a coupon buy for me; restocked during Ulta sales recently. I use this before foundation and between any other layers like blush, highlighter. Milani Make It Last gives it a run for it's money, sure enough. \n\n🥰 Givenchy Irresistible: I adore it, bought a bottle during a suspiciously well timed GWP right after. Damn you Ulta. It's super pretty. \n\n🪨 LRP Anthelios AOX 50: I keep going back to this even when I'm supposed to be trying alternatives lol, but October was a month during which I needed consistency for work makeup prep. If I see it on sale again soon I'll probably get more. \n\n👍 Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil: good post shower carrier oil when I need something stronger than fractionated coconut, but don't want an opinionated scent. Already repurchased. \n\n🫡 CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion: I found a bit leftover and finished it off. This was my go to for a couple years. A good product, but too lightweight for me now. If you're combo sensitive, give this a shot. \n\n🥰 Jason Vitamin E Oil: kind of a cheat because I just refilled my pump bottle with this, but my used up bucket is being relocated. This smells like what I want from almond-y products - marzipan! Delicious and moisturizing. A delightful post-showed treat. Automatic re buy for me. \n\n🏆 Goldbond Softening Foot Cream: the absolute GOAT foot cream, maybe my favorite rebuy of all time. This absolutely changed my feet, obliterated all cracks and is my ride or die skincare product at this point. Urea is the key! \n\n🙄 Clarins Total Eye Lift: I assume a sample doesn't have enough to appreciate it's magicalness, or, more likely, that eye creams all tend to just blur together for me. Meh. \n\n🫨 Clarins Double Serum: I really like this. But not that price tag, hell no. For that price I better look ten years younger. Surprisingly I love the scent. But not for that price, nerp.\n\n💯 Elf Lash XTNDR: this is the best brown tubing drugstore mascara, IF ONLY because it doesn't dry out quite as fast as the Maybelline Sky High brown tuber. Priced to play. \n\n🤨 Boucheron Jaipur: this reminds me of a family friend from childhood: predictably classy, if not perhaps a bit kooky. I think I might be having a flashback to a nice but crazy lady when I smell this. Glad to be done with it. \n\n👍 Tory Burch Sublime: nice! I have a few samples and a mini bottle from Ulta GWP to spend more time with this. It's subtley sexy, a nice day to evening scent. \n\n🫡 Hero blemish patches: a good GWP inclusion. But I think I prefer the K Beauty brand iterations, so I won't be buying these again. My first zit stickers brand, glad to have had them. \n\n🤔 Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream: it's very good. Still not sure I'll buy it. The slight coolness is nice. I'm working on other options to broaden my horizons. This is the evening cream to beat for me so far. \n\n👍 Innisfree Aloe Energy Mask: delightful and refreshing. Used one hot annoying evening: great moisturizing and nice scent. Will repurchase. \n\n🫠 Hydrinity mask (not pictured) A free sample from some online order. I was really impressed with the results, my skin was well hydrated, softer, really nice...but $18 apiece, urm, uh...hmmmmmm......\n\n",

My skin cleared up and I haven't had any new acne.\nExcept... those comedones still haven't gone away.\n\nI started using an AHA (14% Alpha Hydrox serum) to help out with them. It thinned out the skin and helped some of them emerge more.\nBut it seems... that the only way to make them go away is to squeeze them out once they emerge a bit, and then it gets red and inflamed...but it does heal up. When I squeeze, the insides come out like a full blown white head (white seeds and snakes), so maybe they are \"ready\" to squeeze?\n\nI prefer not to do this because my face looks bad after I squeeze and I know it's not good to do. Also, I have a lot left to work on... but sometimes I feel like the only way to get rid of them is to bring them to a head and then extract them.\n\nIs there a better way? Should I try a retinoid or something?\nAny suggestions would be great.",

Kinda went crazy with my own recipe even though I’m still fairly new.\n\nIt was a bit overwhelming because I felt like I had to work fast between stick blending and pouring into the slab. My colored soaps started to set in the pouring pitchers as they were getting stick blended and I waited until right before pouring to add fragrance. Is it possible that I used too much shea butter?\n\nIt’s possible I may have also over-mixed because it looked like a pretty thick trace.. like gloppy pudding instead of a flowy batter. I wish I had taken pictures but again, I was feeling rushed lol. Is it advised to undermix for an easier pour/this technique? I was worried it wouldn’t reach trace. Aesthetically I also probably should have poured the white last to add more contrast against all the dark colors. \n\nOverall I’m happy that I got some kind of swirl! I’m trying to embrace the mistakes and remember that the soap is still usable even if it’s not what I envisioned (that is if it’s still safe to use). Obviously I could’ve done a much smaller batch but I was too excited to use the dividers.. :)\n\nRecipe: 75oz\n\n40% lard\n25% sweet almond oil\n25% shea butter\n7% jojoba oil\n3% castor oil\n\n2.25 oz Bramble Berry fragrance\n6 tsp sodium lactate (I think I fudged on this and put a tad too much?)\n\n8% superfat\n40% lye concentration \n\nThis was also my first time going this high on lye. I did 33% on all my previous batches and I always got a ton of soda ash. I had a feeling it had to do with my city’s hard water even though I have an RODI filter. I also sprayed with 99% isopropyl alcohol and left it covered in the oven (off and overnight) after pre-heating at 175.\n\nI know I was making a huge gamble with this big of a batch but only time will tell once I unmold these bars to see if it was worth it. I will post another picture once I do!\n\nOpen to any tips on how to better prepare for more advanced techniques like this or what I could have changed about the batter setting too soon before pouring. I’m still playing around with recipe percentages and different oils & butters so any advice is greatly appreciated!",

I go heavy on olive oil (60%) and use a 29% to 30% lye solution. Both slow down trace.

        "body": "That much Shea butter likely isn't helping the thick trace issue, but people newer to soaping do tend to over blend as well, and with a tight lye water ratio, you blend even less. Shea is high in stearic acid, which makes it thicken the batter at a faster rate than some of the other hard oils. I find my bars are too waxy for my taste with that much Shea, but everyone has their own preferences and others like it just fine. The lard probably helped you out though, as it slows things down. \n\nI use a 40% lye concentration, and I manage swirls just fine, so I personally think its worth it to try to work with that ratio if soda ash is a problem. I would personally lower the Shea and up the lard, and just be much more judicious with the stick blending. Get the batter to trace and then do much more hand stirring from there. Patience is your friend when it comes to stick blending.\n\nThat being said, the thicker trace likely helped you keep the colors from getting too muddy. Trace can be a bit of a dance with swirls, depending on the goals for your soap design. Too thick, and you risk not getting a good swirl and air pockets trapped in the soap become a risk, but too thin and the colors can bleed into each other in a way you may not like and your colors can get muddied. \n\nYou won't know about the true swirl and air pockets until demolding, but from this view your soap looks absolutely lovely and is a gorgeous example of a swirl. I really like the crisp delineation of the colors here. You'll have to wait to see what you think about the properties of the soap itself to see of you want to change the recipe, but from my view, this looks fabulous!",

You only need to get the mixture to emulsion, divide the batter, and mix colours in by \"hand.\"\n\nStearic acid does react faster than soft oils, so lowering that in your recipe gives more time to work. \n\nIt is true that you do need to plan ahead and work fast when making swirls, so you can be prepared that to be a thing in the future :)",

They’re very beneficial, especially if you need a customized skincare routine!\n\nI’d personally suggest not going to a chain like Massage Envy or Hand and Stone and check out well-reviewed solo esties in your area or ones that use/sell quality brands which many times are at med spas or dermatology offices. I made a comment on this sub recently and said I’d rather skip my bi-weekly coffee shop order or go out to eat less to justify spending money on products that work for me that are on the pricier side. If I wasn’t in this field, I’d also find an esthetician I trusted that I see great results with!\n\nMy personal favorites brands that I skip my oat milk latte for are Dr. Dennis Gross, EltaMD, and SkinCeuticals. In my opinion if something is going to wash down the drain (i.e. cleanser) I don’t splurge on that. But serum, moisturizer, spf- I definitely do. I haven’t seen the same results with drugstore products and most of the time, these brands can only be found in esthetic/derm offices. :)\n\nAs another commenter said, getting a facial that focuses on exfoliation and helping your dry skin will allow your products to sink in better. If you’re able to get the facial done before it gets super cold, you can set yourself up for success for the upcoming cold! :)",

One of the most essential parts to a good skincare routine, but alas my oily skin paired with a humid environment, needs its own swayamvar. I have always wanted to find a good HG moisturizer that works in the day and night, with makeup , sunscreen and so on. Today you guys, I think I found the one. \n\nSo far it was just sebamed for the day ( still amazing) but it has a tight feeling and the soon jung barrier cream( night) and I longed to find just ONE that works day and night , so my wallet can breathe a bit easy. \n \nEnter Rovectin Clean Lotus Water Cream.\n\nThis super gel-cream hybrid moisturizer boasts the ever loved niacinamide and apparently fancy lotus water has been used in place of water, to help with cleansing and cooling. While am not sure if its legit, it 100% for sure feels like a burst of fresh water . I am that Type A person who needs to purely test said product in different conditions and variables , before i declare it HG .\n\nSo i ve tested for 3 weeks now and this was the sole addition to my skincare routine. Getting into my experience.\n\nPROS:\n\n*A wonderful gel cream texture that sinks in. \n\n*Perfect for oily and combo skin. \n\n*Contains superstar ingredient niacinamide 2%.\n\n*Has a beautiful finish( looks slightly radiant / luminous from within) but it is NOT sticky/ dewy.\n\n*Doesnt make me sweat in buckets despite the heat and masks.\n\n*Not pore clogging( I have super cloggable skin if thats a word)\n\n*Amazing for sensitive skin. ( Fussy skin here)\n\n*Plays nice with almost every skincare product in my routine.\n\n*Looks amazing under makeup! \n\n*Comes with cute stickers( irrelevant but so cute)\n\n*Great tube packaging, can squeeze out the exact amount required.\n\nCONS:\n\n*Comes with a hefty price tag of 1900 for 60ml. But i picked it up for 1600 Rs ish during a sale from skinbae.\nPlease note skinbae is also having a holi sale rn for 15% off on this product and no skinbae is not sponsoring me :P\n\n*Contains sweet almond oil, which was certainly not an issue for me, but if you are someone with bad experience with this ingredient, beware.\n\n*Possibly not hydrating / moisturizing enough for our dry skin buddies out here. \n\nSo if you have oily/ combo skin and struggling to find that moisturizer to work for all times day night, with and without makeup and so on.. I think give this a shot.",

    "body": " Over the summer, I took a few baby steps into the world of plants, ritual and magic. Along the way, I bought many products from Cattail Apothecary. Here are thoughts on a few! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/998kh3qwwic61.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d990fba4f7f118e196813399bd80a21b583a67\n\n \n\n**Bright Spirit Mood Boost Elixir** (*A boost to the body's mental, emotional and physical states.  This adaptogen blend is meant to be taken regularly to enhance energy and stamina, improve memory, concentration and mood, reduce depression, stress and fatigue while maintaining a healthy hormonal balance.*)\n\nAt one point over the summer, I thought about finding a systematic way of testing the efficacy of tinctures, but it seemed difficult to do. If I recover quickly from stress or a shitty day, who’s to say if my bouncing back was from the tincture or from a friend comforting me or from some other unforeseen variable? Also, supposing the tincture does have an effect, isn’t it possible that it only made me 0.5% happier, as opposed to 50% happier? This is all to say that I still have no idea how to tell if Bright Spirit actually helped me a significant amount or not, but I do have faith in the power of plants and ritual, so much so that I bought a 4 oz bottle of Bright Spirit after I finished my 1 oz bottle HAHA.\n\n**Unclouded Heart Emotional Support & Heart Tonic** (*Nourish the heart, physically and metaphysically. An exceptional tonic for the heart and cardiovascular system, supporting heart health and blood pressure balance. It is also a support system for the heart chakra. Hawthorn and roses are excellent plant allies in grief and heartbreak. They are food for the emotional center, assisting in opening oneself to love, from others and from Self.*)\n\nI’ve been working through a lot of grief and heartbreak since the end of this past summer, and it was extremely comforting to take 2 droppers of Unclouded Heart everyday. I don’t think specialized tinctures are a cure-all, and in my correspondence with Bex (the owner of Cattail Apothecary), I got the impression it’s important to pay attention to what else one’s body and soul really needs. This being said, at some points when I felt absolutely wretched, I’d feel temporarily better knowing that I took my daily droppers. Is this placebo? Most definitely. Is it more than placebo? I’m guessing so as well. Is it more effective than meditation? Probably not, but I think tinctures are a good supplement to other lifestyle habits. \n\n**Wake Up Call Caffeine Under Eye Treatment** (*Made of sweet almond oil that has been infused with both guayusa leaf and matcha powder combined with argan oil, rosehip seed oil, and jojoba oil. Essential oils of peppermint and cypress add a light energizing scent.*)\n\nI love the convenience of the packaging: I simply roll the treatment under my eye without needing to wash my hands before or after applying. My friends who are knowledgable about skin care says the ingredients (guayasa and argan oil in particular) are great for the under-eye area. It’s hard to tell if half a year of usage resulted in changes: I’m barely out of my teens, so my skin is still youthful. To systematically test results, I could only apply this on one eye and capture results after a year or see how eye bags compares to that of friends 5 years from now, but I’d much rather just have faith in this product and keep using it haha. In the worst case scenario, Wake Up Call is just a very good moisturizer for my eyes, which is important to all skin care routines anyways! This 10 ML roller is very cost effective: it’s $18 for over a year of usage. Will be repurchasing. ",

I've also used the vaseline/coca butter oil/lotion stuff (can't remember exact name) and the aquaphor ointment body spray.\n\nI actually hated the L'occitane lol -- it's very greasy and has a strong fragrance. It's not an unpleasant fragrance in and of itself, but it's not one I'd choose to put on my body normally. The one good thing about it is it is extremely hydrating...but it also never seems to dry. I've gotten it on my sheets putting it on several hours before bed :(. I don't have particularly dry skin on my body though, so possibly someone with very dry skin might see a benefit.\n\nProbably out of the rest, the Curel was my favorite, surprisingly. Mostly because it was just so easy to use and I only had to use the tiniest little amount and it would spread so easily and quickly. I keep looking for something else because tbh I love trying different products and Curel isn't super exciting lol so I'm looking for something a bit more luxurious-feeling :P.\n\nThe vaseline stuff was similar to l'occitane. The Aveeno was better than those two at being a little less greasy (still a bit greasy though), but I didn't think it absorbed as well as the vaseline and it wasn't as hydrating as the l'occitane.\n\nThe aquaphor ointment spray was super convenient, but a) it could be very messy if I was not super careful about where I sprayed it, and I was nervous that could create a slipping hazard. It actually absorbed pretty well (I did have to rub a little bit after spraying). The main problem with it even if I was careful to clean anything left over after was I was going through the bottle way too quickly. Even trying to be careful not to waste any and not overspraying, it just seemed like there wasn't much in the bottle to begin with.\n\nSo yeah...search continues. A couple of my list to try are the Osea oil, jergen's wet skin, and the Hanni splash salve in-shower body moisture treatment. I've looked at the Nivea in-shower body lotion, but there are a lot of people saying that it's extremely messy, they had trouble rinsing it down the drain, and that it creates a slipping hazard. So I probably am not going to try it. Might just go back to Curel even though it's not exciting since theirs was the best so far :P.",

What other traditional skin care techniques actually are effective?\n\n>Elisabeth used cosmetics and perfume sparingly, as she wished to showcase her natural beauty. On the other hand, to preserve her beauty, she tested countless beauty products prepared either in the court pharmacy or by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments. She appeared to favor \"Crème Céleste\" (compounded from white wax, [spermaceti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermaceti), sweet almond oil, and [rosewater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewater)), but preferred a wide variety of facial tonics and waters.  \n>  \n>  \n.... either raw veal or crushed strawberries lined her nightly leather facial mask.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Elisabeth_of_Austria#cite_note-21) She was also heavily massaged, and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist; her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Elisabeth_of_Austria#cite_note-ReferenceD-20) To further preserve her skin tone, she took both a cold shower every morning (which in later years aggravated her arthritis) and an olive-oil bath in the evening.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Elisabeth_of_Austria#cite_note-ReferenceA-5)",

I'm gonna break down/rate the products that I used in this past (and first) year in the hopes that someone might read this and maybe be helped in the way I have been by this community and all of its resources. I'm gonna try to keep the reviews short so this doesn't get too long!\n\nNot all of the products that I used were AB, so I won't take the time to review them in this space. I'll just list them and if anyone has comments or questions about them feel free to ask!\n\nAs noted in the title, my skin type went from constant patchy dryness on my forehead and cheeks (which I couldn't figure out for YEARS) to mostly normal skin now! I don't struggle too much with acne, but I do get pimples around my period or sometimes if I eat too much pizza/am stressed, which is when we eat more pizza amiright lol.\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\n✨ *Heimish All Clean Balm:* 4/5. I really liked this balm! Nothing in it irritated my skin and I felt like it worked well. Then I read an article on here about microplastics and since my balm was nearly out, I decided to switch to a regular oil cleanser.\n\n✨ *Muji Sensitive Skin Oil Cleanser:* 5/5. I love this stuff. It works so well, has never broken me out, and does its job. Plain & simple. I appreciate that it doesn't really have a scent, unlike the heimish.\n\n**Face Wash**\n\nUnfortunately, no AB face washes for me yet.\n\n✨ *Glossier Milky Jelly*\n\n✨ *La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser*\n\n**Actives**\n\nAlso no AB products here, but I am looking for an AB Vit C recommendation!\n\n✨ *TO Lactic Acid 5% + HA*\n\n✨ *Drunk Elephant C Firma*\n\n✨ *Drunk Elephant Baby Facial*\n\n✨ *PC 2% BHA*\n\n**Toner**\n\n✨ *Klairs Supple Preparation Toner:* 5/5. I LOVE this stuff. It lasted me like 6 months, and I liked the scent of it for some reason. I appreciate that it was heavy duty enough for my dry skin, but it doesn't take half of forever to dry down. When I finish my current toner I'll repurchase this.\n\n✨ *Whamisa Organic Flowers, Deep Rich:* 3.5/5. I like this toner. I just don't love it. The scent isn't my favorite, and imo it's pretty sticky. I think it's sweet that on the back of the bottle it says, \"God Loves You.\" That being said, I can't hate too much cause it does do its job. I just don't love it as much as I'd thought. \n\n**Essence**\n\n✨ *Snail Bee High Content Essence:* 3/5. So at first, I felt like this visibly improved redness. Then I started to feel like maybe I just liked it for the extra layer of product. At the end of the bottle, I decided I liked it, but not enough to hunt down another old formula of it.\n\n**Ampoule**\n\n✨ *Scinic Honey AIO:* 4/5. Okay, I know this is a divisive product. In general, I haaaate sticky products/things in general. But I actually like this. It definitely adds another extra layer of hydration to my skin, but I've noticed that if I have a fresh pimple, this seems to really help it. Plus, it's such an economical bottle. I've had it for 5 months and still have 90% of it left. \n\n**Emulsion**\n\n✨ *Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera Ultra Emulsion:* 7/5. Suffice it to say that I'm obsessed with this product. It healed my sensitized skin and has basically eliminated the need for an extra moisturizer for me. Do you have sensitive, dry skin? Try this.\n\n**Cream**\n\n✨ *Huxley Secret of Sahara Cream, More than Moist:* 3/5. Probably was a little too swayed by their beautiful minimalist packaging, but this is a decent cream. I read it described as \"buttery\" and I totally agree. It's also pleasantly scented but if you're sensitive to scent, skip it. If you used it just alone and not with many layers as a dry skin person, it wouldn't do much. I honestly don't use it much since Holika Holika.\n\n**Oil**\n\n✨ *TO Squalane Oil*\n\n✨ *NOW Sweet Almond Oil*\n\n**SPF**\n\n✨*Rohto Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk SFP 50 PA+++:* 4/5. This starts out super greasy, but within minutes I'm able to apply foundation on top of it with no problems. No whitecast and is actually nice for dry skin! It doesn't have the typical sunscreen smell imo. Only thing I would say is, if you're gonna be swimming or in water, I would recommend a more waterproof spf. I got a little burned once after using this, but I was surfing for a few hours and didn't reapply, so maybe that's my fault!\n\n\nWell, if you made it this far, I congratulate & thank you for reading! I'm so grateful for all of y'all and the reviews you write & knowledge you share. It's because of people who went before me and shared products for my skin type that led me to really fixing my skin. So really, thank you. /sap\n\n\n",

I'd really appreciate some advice about what's wrong with it, and the best way to deal with it.\n\nI'm 27 & female. Always had good skin during my teens, & frankly I never paid attention to it. I never wore moisturizer or suncream, or stuck with any particular regimen. In the last few years I moved to a harsher climate (northern Vermont) and my skin has really suffered. I have all these congested bumps all over my face, especially my chin, cheeks and temples. They periodically break out. It's mostly just on the surface, but sometimes I get deep, painful pimples (rarely).\n\nSome pictures here - warning they are close ups! http://imgur.com/a/jRHi1\n\nAt the moment, I've been trying OCM. I use sweet almond oil, castor oil and sometimes a couple of drops of tea tea - I do this morning and night. Sometimes I moisturize with jojoba oil, othertimes with this stuff: http://www.alaffia.com/store/pc/Neem-Shea-Butter-Skin-Recovery-Face-Cream-10p121.htm\n\nA couple of times a week, I exfoliate with [this neutrogena scrub](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Naturals-Purifying-Pore-Scrub/dp/B004D2DQSY). Recently I picked up some of that Aztec clay, tried it a few days ago, didn't see anything miraculous but will stick with it.\n\nSo, what should I do? What are these bumps?! I guess I shouldn't be popping them... I'd be happy to spend some $ on products that work!\n\nThank you :)",

        "body": "Most people believe that congested pores means your face is dirty and not cleaning very well but actually, the common cause is using wrong cleansers and it can lead to dehydrated skin then it can cause excessive oil production / excessive dead skin cell build ups. Other reasons: makeup, allergic reactions, skin irritation and hormones. \n\nMy issue with congested pores is from skincare products. I'm super sensitive to synthetic fragrances, SLS, dyes, alcohol and more. If I use a product with one of them, my skin will be clogged. You have to find the cause of your congested pores. \n\nHow long have you been using castor oil? It is very drying and it can lead to increased oil production = clogged pores. If you were me, I'd stop using castor oil.\n\nNeutrogena Naturals scrub is pointless, it won't fix your problem. You can switch to [Stridex pads](http://www.stridex.com/products.asp) but if you're sensitive to salicylic acid. If so then you can use [St. Ives Scrub Free Exfoliating pads](http://www.drugstore.com/st-ives-scrub-free-exfoliating-pads/qxp391636). It will take weeks to see the result.\n\nAztec Secret does work but it takes time. It is effective with raw apple cider vinegar than water. \n\nKeep using almond oil or jojoba oil to moisturize.\n\nIt is best to use less products and let your skin heal. Do not pop them. You can see a dermatologist for extraction - they do it better because it won't scar.\n\nUse Stridex or St. Ives as your PM cleanser, diluted raw apple cider vinegar is also a good idea - they are awesome to clean clogged pores. You can mix 25% to 50% ACV with water and use it every morning. Moisturize with jojoba. Every night, you can use jojoba oil and [unrefined shea butter](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/4019979/3811980.htm) to keep your skin hydrated. Use Aztec Secret once or twice a week. Remember, less is more. :)\n\n---\n\n[Seven Easy Ways to Treat Congested Skin](http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/15232/1/Seven-Easy-Ways-to-Treat-Congested-Skin.html)",

So here I am trying to give back something. Thank you to everyone who posts here!\n\nSkin details: oily/combo skin, bengaluru, teenage\n\nHair details: 2a/2b/2c (mostly 2b), dry scalp in winters, wavy, low porosity I think, kinda virgin (except the times I hair-dried my hair like twice in an year or when until half an year ago I would occasionally fail to regulate the shower heat properly and put really hot water on my hair lol)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Cleansing oil:**\n\n***Johnson’s Baby Oil*** (not in pic coz in the bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: past few weeks on and off*\n\nNon-emulsifying fragranced mineral oil. I wanted to oil cleanse since my skin felt congested and this was the cheapest option; I got 50ml for 62rs. Fragrance did not irritate me (smell wise wasn’t irritating too). Idk how it works on removing stuff since I am not using sunscreen yet. Skin felt soft and clearer after using. Wiped with a tissue before moving on to cleanser.\n\nNo issues/5. WRP\n\n**Cleanser:**\n\n***Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash*** (not in pic coz I do not have it anymore):\n\n*Usage Period: 2 years until a few months ago*\n\nUsed a long time ago. Helped me alot initially when I was trying to fix my skin (this is obviously better than using body wash/soap).\n\n2.5/5 since I noticed my pimples decreased when I switched to the next cleanser on the list. WNRP\n\n***Simple Refreshing Facial Wash*** (have my backup bottle in the pic; one I am using right now is in the bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: an year i think*\n\nA GAME CHANGER in my routine. I used to switch b/w creams and serums wondering where I was going wrong, but ignored the cleansing part. Acne-proneness reduced significantly once I started using it. Never leaves skin stripped even in summer. Affordable. Removes sweat and dirt well. It's all you could ask from a cleanser.\n\nHG\n\n**Toner:**\n\n***TONYMOLY WONDER Ceramide Mochi Toner:***\n\n*Usage Period: Past few weeks regularly*\n\nYes I did buy this during the recent nykaa sale. I was looking for toners within budget but seeing u got to pay 300-500 rs for 100-150 ml, I decided to buy this based on reviews. I just wish I had read the ingredient list before, coz it has macadamia oil (trying to avoid oils since my skin gets oily). I honestly dk what to feel about this toner. It cannot be used on its own for sure, since my skin starts making more oil. Layered with other products however, it does a nice job, in fact it made my skin SUPER SOFT so ig it satisfies what it claims to do. It gives that dewy look to skin (which could get oily but tbh I am bad at figuring out the difference). But for the quantity and ingredients you get (excluding the macadamia, rosewood, lemon peel oils and added fragrance like limonene and all), it is a really nice toner. If you use only one layer (don't try layering it unless u have really dry skin coz it gets sticky, no 7skin technique with this one which is a shame considering the quantity), then it is pretty nice. Using both in the AM and PM. No breakouts caused. Secure packaging.\n\n3.75/5, Maybe Repurchase (another toner from the same WONDER range might suit oily skin ppl more) (i think ill buy smthn else totally next time) (pls drop reccs for economic toners)\n\n**Serum:**\n\n***DermaCo 2% Salicylic Acid Serum*** (not in pic coz empty in the bin):\n\n*Usage Period: An year or two on and off*\n\nFirst serum I ever used. Really helped me decrease my pimples, but considering I used it with a body moisturizer (vaseline ice cream) or no moisturizer at all back then, that too inconsistently, I do not think it was able to do its job properly hehe. Lightweight. The earlier dropper sucked but the second one was pretty good. Emptied 2 bottles. Has a weird smell at first which fades away after a couple weeks (my suggestion: do not put it directly under ur nose (moustache area) during that period).\n\n3.5/5 WRP\n\n***Pilgrim Oil Control Salicylic acid and Niacinamide Serum:***\n\n*Usage Period: Since a few months ago on and off, regularly for the past few weeks*\n\nI bought this when dermaco ran out and this was on sale (despite the gimmicky k-beauty marketing, but now I realize it is just their company's theme to focus on different locations for different lines). 4% niacinamide and 2% salicylic acid in this one. It does help soothe pimples and prevent them, but this is wayy more oily and tacky than the dermaco one. Dermaco had just witch hazel while this has green tea, neem, willow bark, aloe vera, tea tree, etc. in the formulation, which must explain the oiliness, but no problem using it in the PM. Other than that pretty good serum. This has a herbal scent which does not go away with time; idk what tea tree oil smells like but I imagine it to be like this, but it is not a very bad smell (imo). Normal dropper packaging.\n\n3.51/5 WRP\n\n**Aloe Vera Gel** (putting this here coz now I use aloe vera gel at the essence stage):\n\n***Patanjali Aloe Vera Gel:***\n\n*Usage Period: once*\n\nBought this in a hurry for 60rs coz I had just waxed and the local aloe vera gel (colored and fragranced but didn’t irritate but idk which brand) I had used last time which was lying around in the house had expired. You would use aloe vera gel for soothing irritated areas, but I put this heavily colored and fragranced sh1t on my body and face AND IT BURNED. So no. ABSOLUTELY NEVER AGAIN (it is half empty coz I ended up using some for a hair experiment and idk how it went)\n\n0/5 HOLY FAIL\n\n***Innisfree Aloe Revital Soothing Gel:***\n\n*Usage Period: Regularly for the past few weeks*\n\nGot this for B1G1 at rs475 during nykaa pink summer sale (steal imo). Colorless clear gel. Has a faint chemical smell which is not even noticeable unless u try really hard (common in non-fragranced products methinks). Some ppl on the internet say it has very little aloe in it, while I read somewhere that Innisfree confirmed to a customer that ingredient lists work differently in Korea than in other parts of the world and their gel has got 93% aloe, but idk. Really soothing. I was using it at the essence stage simply coz heyy I have 600ml of aloe vera gel might as well use it, but this morning I had what i call reyHasIrritatedSkinForNoRealReasonOnlyInMornings without even putting a single product on my skin and even after my usual moisturizer, something that was pretty common for me in the daytime (hormones? Hard water? No sunscreen? The possible reasons are plenty), but this gel is really helpful for it. It feels like it does not do anything but I cant got without it now. Obviously cannot be used as a standalone moisturizer. Will use it the next time I get a wax, if I have not come back here to update just assume that it worked really well. No complaints. Easily spreadable. Tube came sealed, small nozzle which is really convenient and I get only the amount of the product I need.\n\n4.75/5 WRP/HG\n\n**Moisturizer:**\n\n***Dr. Sheth’s Ceramide and Vitamin C oil free moisturizer:***\n\n*Usage Period: few months on and off*\n\nFirst moisturizer I bought a couple of months back instead of just using whatever random cream my mom bought. 50g for 300 something rs (it is 327 right now on amazon and i think 279 on flipkart). Usual tube packaging. Ashwagandha smell (coz it has ashwagandha). And it has to be one of the best moisturizers. EVER. It just sank into my skin, didn't feel like anything was on, but really moisturized very well, I could tell my skin did not like going without it. Later with the ceramide mochi toner ISTG THE SOFTNESS? It has 1% vitc. I think my face glowed a little bit (or was it just finally getting into a consistent routine?) Did sometimes feel like it made my skin too stuffy/moisturized tho (it says it has coconut alkanes, which ik is not the same as coconut oil so it is not comedogenic, but idk). Did not break me out. I finished the tube, and I have never finished any moisturizer in my life. Highly recommend as long as ur not sensitive to any of the ingredients.\n\n4.5/5 WRP\n\n***Dot and Key Cica and Niacinamide oil free moisturizer:***\n\n*Usage Period: twice yesterday (am and pm)*\n\nGot the 50g tube delivered this morning and used it. 5% niacinamide and centella in this one. I bought htis coz i thought i did not need vitc and niacinamide better targets my skin concerns. 5% niacinamide serums are pricey (10% is too strong i fear even if i wanna try the 15ml 300smthn rs plum one), and I wanted to get smthn centella (my toner has it but still) so i bought this one, seeing it had really similar ingredients (same ceramides and all) to the dr.sheth’s one, and is literally almost the same price for 50ml. Ik i have not used this long enough, just once, but I can tell you it is REALLY STICKY. So sticky I put a tissue paper on my cheek and it STUCK. It also smells like glue/paint/i dont remember what but it is really familiar. It formed this film on my skin which was light and subtle and did not look bad, but it did not sink in like the dr.sheth’s one (have they increased my standards?). I looked at the ingredients and thought it must be the dimethicone, but even dr.sheth’s has dimethicone. I am not an ingredient/chemistry person (not even a science student lol), but the whatever makes a moisturizer sticky or layery/ silicones are really siliconing in this one. Kinda soothing to wear (not soothing enough to calm down my morning irritation, I needed to use innisfree aloe for that). Feels like it's pulling my face taut. But now I gotta finish this before buying another product. It does not seem like it is breaking me out or clogging my pores \\*yet\\*, but if it does not, ill just use it till it gets over.\n\nHave not used enough to rate, but first impression 2.0/5\n\nOKAY here is my 2nd impression; it is not that bad. I just realised I was using it the same way I used the dr.sheth’s moisturizer, which is cream/gel like and is easily spreadable. This is also cream/gel like but more solid? I read the instructions and it asked to be dotted and then spread in upward motions. I ended up doing it and realised maybe I am also using more quantity, so I swiped some off. And it worked pretty well (and is not that sticky)! Still doesn't leave a silky smooth finish like the dr sheth’s one, but I think this is decent. I woke up this morning and usually every morning if I do not cleanse my face within 30 mins to 1 hour of waking up it would feel really irritated as though it were saying “gEt ThIs GuNk OfF mE”, but it did not feel like that today! I’ll take that as a win. Second impression 3.25/5\n\nEDIT: 3rd impression: No. I was just trying to gaslight myself into thinking it is okay it makes skin look really oily. Will use it till it gets over as long as I am not going out anywhere. 2.5/5\n\n***NIVEA Soft*** (no pic coz with mom):\n\n*Usage Period: very rarely here and there*\n\nThis is my mom’s absolute HG moisturizer. Back when I was younger and had parched dry absolutely-not-taken-care-of skin in the winter, she suggested it to me too. So I put it on but it had a really burning sensation. My mom said it was probably coz of extreme dryness, and that had made sense coz I would feel the same sensation on my dryy legs when I put a different lotion. Fast forward a couple years and when dr.sheth’s got over and I was still deciding which moisturizer to buy next, I took some of this for a night. And it still BURNED! After a layer of toner, serum, and aloe vera gel! I had been pretty diligent with moisturizing so WHY? Then I checked the ingredients list and found \\*drumroll\\* *alcohol.* So ig my skin does not like alcohol. You might like it if it suits you. I can finally stop dreaming about someday getting one of those lightweight japanese alcohol sunscreens like skin aqua or nivea super water gel (I am happy for my wallet but sad in general). On top of that it became quite oily like I had literally put oil on my skin (it does have jojoba oil).\n\nI do not think I am eligible to rate this/5.\n\n**Lip balms:**\n\n***SUGAR lip balm*** (05 Irish Coffee):\n\n*Usage Period: Past few months regularly*\n\nMy mom gave this to me since she did not really use it and ig it is okay. Obviously better than nothing on lips at all. Using this right now. Convenient typical twist lip balm packaging. No color. 3/5.\n\n***Himalaya Cocoa butter lip balm***(not in pic coz i chucked it):\n\n*Usage Period: Almost 6 months*\n\nThis is just outright bad, sits on ur lips and does nothing. No color. 1/5. WNRP\n\n***McCaffiene Coffee Lip Balm*** (not in pic coz it is with my mom):\n\n*Usage Period: once*\n\nI used it only once coz this one is also my mom’s and it healed my lips and made them so soft? I was really surprised. I think it is pricey tho for the amount u get (but lip balms in general are pretty pricey)Still tryna steal it from her hehe. Not used long enough to review, but 4/5. No color.\n\n**Sunscreens:**\n\n***Lacto Calamine Lacto Calamine Sunshield Matte Look Sunscreen SPF50 PA+++***(not in pic coz in the bin):\n\n*Usage Period: Twice or thrice*\n\nImmense white cast that goes away (kinda) with a lot of rubbing. Really tacky feeling. Would never wanna reapply. No. 2/5. WNRP (idek about the protection)\n\n***Satthwa SPF 50 PA+++ water based sunscreen***(not in pic coz in the bin):\n\n*Usage Period: Twice or thrice*\n\nGot this coz good reviews on amazon and 100g for the usual price of 50g. First red flag shoulda been this came in a transparent tube which was wrapped in packaging sticker (that was uncovered in the top and bottom area) like as tho this was not a sunscreen lol. Yeah no white cast as the reviews said but made my skin greasy and disgusting as hell. Broke me out in small pimples. My poor self did not even know that I needed oil/micellar water to remove sunscreen so I did not even clean it properly and it hurt my face :( 0/5. HF\n\nAll the sunscreens I wanna buy seem expensive :( I am not using any right now since I am mostly indoors for the holidays and natural light in the new house we moved to is really low, but ik i need to figure this out before college starts in mid july. I also hate siliconey/layery sunscreens (I did post asking for help don't worry I got good replies , you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/12x40lq/non_silicone_pharma_sunscreen_reccs_please/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) ). Right now deciding b/w Aurelderma UV edge spf 50 pa+++ but idk if it is photostable (Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Benzophenone-3, Avobenzone combo) and Eunyul Dailycare Fresh Sunscreen Spf 46 pa+++ (nice ingredients, new gen photostable filters, 1500 rs for 300ml on amazon so 250rs for 50g which is cheap but I spend my own savings money for skincare/haircare other than cleanser and shampoo and I’ll have to break the bank for this (I have already spent recklessly on skincare and pre-ordering a kpop album) and also if it does not suit me I’ll end up with 300ml of product I will not use/ will hate using so idk). I hope to figure it out by next month (praying I will not go broke) coz I have hyperpigmentation issues and healing acne scars which might be worsened by sun damage and also I do not want old me complaining coz I am not using sunscreen now lol.\n\n**Hair Oils:**\n\n***Bajaj Almond Drops:***\n\n*Usage Period: All my life i think*\n\n79% mustard oil and 21% sweet almond oil which my mom buys. Nice. Not really willing to buy any oil myself so this does the job for dry detangling. Helps my scalp not get too dry since I use a cleansing shampoo every wash. Idk about hair growth and stuff (I do not think it helps). 4/5 for my use.\n\n**Shampoo:**\n\n***Ayur Coconut Shampoo*** (not in pic coz in bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: All my life till I think 8 months back*\n\nMy mom still swears by this. I have used it most my life. And considering it is just some gel base, coconut oil (which is comedogenic), and 20% sodium laureth sulfate, ig it is not a surprise that when I switched from this, my hairfall INSTANTLY decreased by almost less than half. No thank you. 0/5 ew\n\n***XHC Argan oil Shampoo*** (not in pic coz in bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: 8 - 12 months (till now)*\n\nUse this right now. My uncle initially bought it and I happened to use it, and my hair was immediately less dry and fell less. Idk if this is due to this being good or my ex-shampoo being bad tho. Cleans decent. 3/5 WRP\n\n**Conditioner:**\n\n***Himalaya Dryness Defense Detangler & Conditioner - Hibiscus & Blue Water Lily*** (not in pic coz over):\n\n*Usage Period: Do not remember exactly how long, but finished the bottle (the small one)*\n\nFirst conditioner, best in the drugstore ones i have tried. Does the job. Silicone based. 3/5. Looking for smthn better\n\nI’d also used a ***dove nutritive solutions conditioner*** but i dont remember the variant. But it was not nice i would say. 2/5 WNRP\n\n***Kesh King Conditioner*** (not in pic coz in bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: 3-4 times*\n\nMost recently used conditioner. Big no. Just dries ur hair. 1/5 WNRP\n\nJust bought True Frog’s everyday conditioner (finally pursuing a wavy hair routine? maybe but idk considering the money I have), might review after a couple of uses.\n\n**Hair Gel:**\n\n***Set Wet yellow color:***\n\n*Usage Period: 3-4 times*\n\nNice hold but very strong nauseating men’s perfume/ a car’s inside in really hot weather smell that I do not want in my hair. 2/5 WNRP\n\nChoosing b/w FMC flaxseed gelly or true frog’s styling gel. I also need to buy a leave in conditioner (tho I might just use regular conditioner as a leave in lol)(choosing b/w true frog’s leave in or styling cream (the cream has more protein and ig my hair is okay with protein but it is not really damaged and i do not want to protein overload it). This is obviously gonna be months later IF i get birthday money from relatives.\n\n*Bonus*: Toothpaste is not skincare but Paradontax is my HG. Life changing. Never going back to colgate again. Cleans plaque and have not had bad breath problems (i did get my teeth cleaned last october)(idk who needs to hear this but GUMS BLEEDING IS NOT NORMAL even if ur parent with gum problems themselves tries to gaslight u into thinking it is (my gums were on the verge of crisis)) I also use a 2+ colgate toothbrush instead of a regular one. It is softer and smaller so I focus on brushing each side and part of my teeth more properly.\n\n*Extra* tip which I already commented on someone else’s post, do not use ur regular towel to wipe ur face, air dry it or use a fresh tissue. Also change ur pillowcovers regularly. Also drink plenty of water (I say while drinking only 500-1000 ml of water in a day).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd THAT is almost everything I have ever used. Now that I have let out all this stuff here, I hope my brain will stop running that imaginary youtube channel of me reviewing my skincare and stuff as I do it. Wish me luck for figuring out sunscreen and haircare (and also bodycare which I do not even have a routine for yet, I just use whatever bodywash my family buys (i hate my body skin feeling greasy or sticky any time of the year coz this is india) (my keratosis pilaris cries in agony), pls drop reccs).\n\nThank you for reading this longgg post (or atleast parts of it) with the worst grammar and thought flow known to humankind! (and the most unnecessary details in brackets) Here is to everyone in this subreddit finding their HG’s while not going broke! Until next time! (if there is a next time that is)\n\nwow this is 6 pages in google docs arial size 11 what have i done\n\nI added a review and a second impression and usage periods and it is 7 pages now hehe",

    "body": "That picture isn't in the order I'm reviewing them in, so sorry about that. I ordered the sample set at a different time than these, but they ended up shipping in similar time frames (since the customs and full sizes here had been ordered earlier). I think the order had been made on April 9 and they arrived around May 9, so reviewing them very fresh once again. The customs I ordered have a fractionated coconut carrier oil, as I tend to order, and I think Lovesick Witchery's is typically sweet almond oil. Anyway, I'll review the two customs first and then the general catalogue ones, in alphabetical order for each.\n\nCustoms:\n\nHumble Priest: Beeswax, lavender, moonflower nectar, tonka bean, frankincense, myrrh, leather, clean cotton, and cocobolo wood.\n\nInspiration: Cirrus, from the visual novel Obscura. This guy is the priest of the lunar temple and also a major freak (semi-affectionate). The devs have stated that this man smells like incense, candlewax, and clean cotton, so checked those off the list. I also added what seems to be a favorite flower/herb of his: lavender. The moonflower nectar is something to represent the lunar temple along with his penchant for poison-making, the leather is for his interest in BDSM, and the tonka bean and cocobolo wood are to add a pleasant woodsiness in there. I kind of wanted to make it something that fits the charming front he puts on for his congregation while also matching up with details of him.\n\nCursory Sniff: Sweet, like honeyed flowers. I'm pretty sure I'm catching a combo of the beeswax, lavender, and moonflower nectar notes. I'm intrigued on how this will go.\n\nWearing: I don't entirely know how to describe it, since the notes are blending together fairly well. It's like honey and flowers, but I can smell those other notes beneath it- especially the leather and rosewood (definitely the cocobolo). Maybe a smidge of the cotton? I think it's very pretty and I'm glad it's not too sweet, since I didn't know what to expect from moonflower nectar (other than it being sweeter than the flower itself).\n\nAbout an Hour Later: I think it's shifted more into the frankincense and myrrh (not as familiar with myrrh, admittedly). Think I'm still getting the beeswax, leather, and more woodsy notes; it's just a bit less floral now. It's pretty good, particularly if you don't mind a church aesthetic.\n\nSacrificial Blade: Plum, black tea, belladonna, vanilla suede, white musk, coumarin, sandalwood, and a flash of icy metal.\n\nInspiration: This guy's been going through a lot of incarnations, but I think his name is Rhys. One of the constants for him is a blade that's very important, but also wrecks his shit in a way he doesn't even realize at first, so I kind of focused on that and what sort of environment I associate him with at this moment. We'll see how that all works out later.\n\nCursory Sniff: Definitely getting some plum and the tea, I think. I'm not all that familiar with belladonna, but it's described as \"soft and narcotic\" and I think maybe I smell it and the coumarin?\n\nWearing: This one is pretty. There's fruity plum, but some floral and grassy (more of hay) notes under it. I think I also smell some tea. I was going for a bit of a pastoral vibe and I think this hits it.\n\nAbout an Hour Later: Smelling a bit more of the suede and a little cold metal now, I think. Overall, this one has been pretty stable in how it smells and I like it. Since it's on the soft side, maybe I'll re-order it as a body mist at some point, since I like that format for giving my pajama shirts a little spritz. While this perfume was being formulated, I was mentally questioning myself a bit, but it turned out how I'd wanted. Good to know I was fretting a little over nothing in this case and I do trust Rachel to point out if something's seriously not working.\n\nGeneral Catalogue:\n\nGhost Moth: Cream, ethereal webs of vanilla, amyris, opium smoke, tomb accord, black amber, skin musk, marshmallow root, and ambrette seed.\n\nCursory Sniff: Sweet and smoky, with a little darkness. I think the cream, vanilla, opium smoke, and black amber must be what I'm smelling the most right now. Not as familiar with opium notes or distinguishing between ambers.\n\nWearing: Still sweet, but I find it more dusty than smoky, which isn't a bad thing. There's some sort of combo of notes that slightly reminds me of apple chai, even if it's clearly not that.\n\nAbout an Hour Later: The notes seem to have sorted themselves out into dusty old wood and vanilla, like an old attic. It's very atmospheric and I think the sweeter notes help it not become too dry. It's pretty good, though not one I would jump to compared to some of the others I've tried. If you like atmospheric stuff, especially themed on dusty and woodsy old places, then it's a promising choice.\n\nOracle: Powder, cotton, coumarin, cashmeran, sweater accord, dark vanilla, marshmallow root, amber, skin musk, soft suede, and white musk.\n\nCursory Sniff: It's definitely powdery, but also sweeter than I expected (not sugary or something, though). This is an extremely cuddly sort of perfume.\n\nWearing: Oh, this one is pretty! I think it's the coumarin, cashmeran, amber, and suede, possibly, but this is working for me. I feel like I register the powder and marshmallow root more from a distance, especially when not focusing on it as much. It's is indeed clean and comfortable.\n\nAbout an Hour Later: I feel like the powder, cotton, and marshmallow root are slightly more prominent than earlier, but I can still smell the other notes. This is another one I'm really enjoying. It's clean without being pure soap and it's all just really working for me.\n\nStar Girl: Milk, creamy vanilla, rice pudding, marshmallow fluff, sugar, amber, and white musk.\n\nCursory Sniff: This one doesn't seem to project much from the rollerball, but that's alright. The cursory sniff is really more of a little impression than anything else. Seems to be the milk and rice pudding, albeit very softly.\n\nWearing: Smells like some very mellow, warm rice pudding. Definitely smell the milk and vanilla in this. It's not as sweet as you may expect and there's a little bit of a nuttiness to my nose, though I think that aspect might fade.\n\nAbout an Hour Later: I feel like this one in particular stays pretty consistent. If you can wear a milk note fine, but want something that doesn't lean so heavily on it, I think this one could be promising for you. It reminds me of Bedsheet Ghost and bit, in that it's very inoffensive and stays close for the wear. Could make a good bedtime smell.",

    "body": "**Noble Panacea Review**\n\nI am posting on Reddit for prior to placing my order I searched all over the internet for reviews for this line and it's very hard to find any, today I found some reviews on here so that comforted me, therefore I wanted to share my take on the products I used in the instance someone is out there like me trying to see if the Noble Panacea is worth it.\n\n*Side note:* I chatted with a Noble Panacea representative that this would be the best line for me to try (can't use retinol). They have 2-day delivery which was nice but the box it came in was a bit much, it was so heavy (felt like I was shipped a brick) and all that was supposed be in there was 28 little sachets, however it's elaborate heavy/expensive packaging; the box that holds the Discovey Set and then the slider box that holds the samples. It also came with an 'opener' which in the end was a waste b/c it stopped cutting like it should. You feel \"special\" to open, but also it's gimmicky. I'd prefer some cheap truly recycable packagine and let the product wow me, not a fancy shiny box that opens like a book with a sticker then tissue paper etc.\n\n**Brillant Discover Set**\n\n* **Prime Radiance Serum** \\- *$253 for 30 dose*s - You are to use AM and PM, I did and stopped on day 4 being I had some irritation in spots that I normally get with retinol. Now this product does not have retinol in it but it does have bakuchiol, I believe I also saw glycolic acid so I think a tad too strong for my reactive face if using 2x a day. However once applied, doesn't feel sticky or greasy, sinks right in, has an earthy type smell. You will use all of the little packet, nothing left over, believe me I took scissors and cut up the packet to get every expensive drop out.\n* **Vibrant Eye Infusion** \\- *$149 for 30 doses* \\- Again, you are to use AM and PM, I didn't notice any differences in the eye area when using. However make sure none gets accidentally in or too close to the water line or you'll have watery eyes all day, that was real fun trying to work in Excel. Felt like a normal eye cream, not a lot of slip if you know what I mean, more of a matte finish. You will get 2/3 days out of one packet, insane if they think this is for one use, so you can save money there.\n* **Radiance Resilence Moisturizer** \\- *$215 for 30 doses* \\- I was hoping for a different feel, I like when a day cream is light but packs a punch with hydration and I want it to sink into the skin, maybe I was hoping it to feel like Dr. Sturm's light face cream or La Mer's Soft Cream upon application but actually sink in and do some magic. Instead it's got a texture where it feels a little waxy, the best example I can give is on day 2 of wearing the entire day I went for a hike/run around 4PM, temperature was only 74\\* here in Arizona, not hot at all, at mile 6 when I started running towards the end of the trail my face felt like it was trapped under something, like it could not breath. I am not one who sweats on my face at all but my face felt like it needed to breath and just could not, like I had on a face mask that needed to be washed off. Now when I got into my vehicle and looked in the mirror I looked like I could go straight to dinner, it's a good \"primer\" and does hydrate but the feeling is not my favorite. Finish is not glossy nor matte, just normal I'd say. However I can't imagine how my face would feel when it gets 118\\* here, I'd go insane. You can use one packet for 2 days, in no way should one use an entire packet in the morning, no. Unless you have a giant, I mean giant sized head then I guess you'd need the entire packet or if you will use from chest up that would work.\n* **Overnight Recharge Cream** \\-*$232 for 30 doses* \\- I am one that is ok with my face looking greasy at night if it's going to perform miracles (being I'm in my apartment/house) and when I wake up I actually expect my face to feel like I put on a good night cream. This one didn't pack a punch with hydration for I'd wake and gently touch my face and it felt like nothing was on it. I didn't wake up glowing, I can tell you that however I don't know if that is possible...but for an example last night I used La Mer's the Concentrate then the Moisturizing Cream over and I have been up working since 5:45AM and touching my face right now (8:15AM) it's stilly hydrated from when I put it on last night, and I know I was bad and slept on the left and right side of my face, but I still have hydration and that's important to me, with the Overnight Recharge I did not get that. You will use all of the product in the packet, can't stretch it for 2 days, again I cut this thing open like a treasure seeker to get every bit out and onto my face.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nDuring my \"discovery\" time using the Brillant line on day 2 I had concern that I might like it, like laying in bed thinking \"please don't let this work\" yet also the other part of my brain saying \"let this be the skincare miracle you have been seeking\" reason for the lack of sleep...this was going to cost me **$849 a month** to use all the products mentioned above. Yes I could stretch the eye cream and the day face cream but that is an insane cost for one month, just think that in a year it would cost you **$10K**, I think I'd rather try a laser or microneedling procedure that cost a couple thousand where I know something is actually happening to my face then using products that have sweet almond oil, orange and lemon oil, seaweed, sunflower oil etc. hoping that will revert my face to a teenager.\n\nI was going to try the cleanser + scrub as well the vitamin c from their line but I think I'll wave my white flag, I just am done with little satchets and cutting things open and then sticking them in a ziplock bag to preserve and not waste $...and I only did it 4 days, I can't imagine a month of that.\n\nI think this line works for someone who is very rich and has tough skin, so maybe 20 year old trust fund or actress? I am in my 40's with reactive skin, normal but is very finicky so this did not agree with me. I am active and hike and live b/t Chicago and Arizona and I don't think this works for either environment nor my face.",

When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best.\n\n* The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.\n\n**Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!**\n\n*If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.

I’ve also dabbled in buying several collagen and peptide products because they claim to make a difference and prevent/repair age lines etc. \n\nI don’t really have any major skin concerns other than maintaining moisture, but I used to look for things that claim to prevent aging because I didn’t feel it would hurt to take preventative measures.\n\nNow that I’ve done research on ingredients, I’ve cut down on spending and minimized my skincare routine to 5 things:\n\n1. Castile bar soap\n2. Exfoliating glove\n3. Jojoba oil\n4. Sweet Almond oil… may switch to Apricot \n5. Either the Weleda Baby Cream or the Palmers Vitamin E Concentrate Skin Barrier Repair Moisturizer.\n\nI don’t wash my skin everyday to prevent excessive dryness. When I moisturize my face I dampen my skin with water and massage 1 or 2 oils on my face, neck and chest. I make sure to spend a minute or two gently massaging the under eye area, smile line area and my forehead to let the oils get deeper into the skin. \nIf don’t use oils and need to use a cream to avoid the excessive shine the oils create, I’ll use one of the moisturizers that I mentioned.\n\nI no longer spend money on anything that claims to be a “miracle repair” product or markets themselves as “anti-aging”, contain to have peptides/collagen etc. I don’t buy exfoliating products because an exfoliating glove lasts longer and can be purchased in bulk, which I have done.\n\nJojoba oil has many benefits for the skin since it contains Ceramides and is very similar to the skins sebum. It also absorbs easily and is practically free of any scent. There are also other oils that can even benefit OILY skin as well, like *dry oils*.\n\nDON’T LET THESE SKINCARE BRANDS FOOL YOU WITH THEIR FALSE PROMISES AND MARKETING SCHEMES. Yes, some brands offer great products but many are just cash grabs. \n\n\nPlease research the ingredients in the products you use and the benefits of natural ingredients like carrier oils.\n\n**Mother Nature has your back, not the industry!**\n",

    "body": "A bit ago, I posted on here asking for some recommendations... Lanolin is one of those waxy oils that is SUPER healing and moisturizing / the only oil that actually helps with my super dry lips. I love lanolin-based balms, but just plain lanolin balms got for like, over $16 a tube... and some of the lanolin glosses are over $20. So naturally I wanted to make my own.\n\nIt's actually super easy to make! Nothing intense here. This is essentially just oil- no need for a preservative or anything of the like.\n\n**Ingredients and Needed Items**\n\n* **Lanolin, 8 grams.** You can get some for pretty cheap in a tub, but I used Lanicare Hypo-Lan from Amazon ($15 for 2 tubes that are 2oz each)- it's very close to the stuff from Dr. Lipp (it doesn't have a smell or taste, really, unlike the cheaper lanolins).\n* **Sweet Almond Oil, 2.75 grams.** Any *liquid* oil works here, but because lanolin is so thick, using a thinner oil works best.\n* **Mica, 0.75 grams.** I used mica from TKB Trading / \"How To Make Cosmetics.\" $1.50 per 6-gram \"sample\" bag, which is enough for 8 tubes.\n* **Flavor Oil, 1/4ml.** I used the unsweetened flavor fragrance oils for lip balms from Bulk Apothecary.\n* **Vitamin E / Tocopherols, a few drops.** This is all oil-based, so a preservative shouldn't be necessary, but adding a few drops of vitamin e helps stabilize the oils from oxidation.\n* **Squeezie Lip Balm Tubes.** For this, I used the flat-top tubes from TKB trading. 10 tubes were $5.25 I think? They hold ~11ml according to the website.\n* **Small glass bowl that fits over a small pot.** Essentially a double-boiler, but it should be small if you're only making one tube at a time. This recipe is for 1 tube.\n* **Transfer pipettes.* I use 3ml plastic pipettes I got in a pack of 100 on Amazon for super cheap.\n* **Small scale.** Preferably one that reads out to the nearest 0.01g (more precise than volume measuring instruments).\n\nSuper easy steps:\n\n* Place the glass bowl on whatever scale you own and measure out the lanolin, oil, and mica.\n* Fill the pot a bit with water. It's okay to have a little more water in the pot and use it just like a water bath, btw.\n* Place glass bowl over the pot and turn on the stove.\n* Continuously stir the ingredients together (I just use a transfer pipette for this, since I need one anyways). It shouldn't take long before the lanolin melts down and everything comes together well- lanolin melts at about body temperature.\n* Once it's all melted, pull the pot+bowl off of the stove and add the flavor oil. Stir well.\n* It should still be quite liquid and easy to transfer into the squeeze tubes at this point. This recipe fills exactly one of the tubes (sometimes, due to not being able to get *exactly* an amount of ingredient, I'll have a little bit left over in the bowl, but not much).\n\nThat's it!\n\nFor reference, I've put together an imgur album, which shows what micas I used specifically and how the products came out (+ swatches). You can find that [here](http://imgur.com/a/E623a).",

I'd love to recreate the subtle tint in the awesome lanolin-heavy formula. \n\nI have found squalane oil mixed with lanolin produces amazing hydrating results. Squalane is an oil but I believe it has some humectant properties in addition to simple emollient ones. It's insanely thin/runny and non-oily so it really does complement the lanolin well. I would say that's a good one to sub in case someone doesn't want to do almond oil.\n\nThank you for the detailed pictures and great instructions!",

I posted this in another subreddit earlier but I feel like it might be appreciated here as well!\n\n*Small disclaimer: I don't have any opinion here nor there on doing love spells on other peopler, I personally don't do that but if that's what floats your boat, you can make your own choices.*\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5ybx0c6roae1.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbe6dd98a32756231237b69c647ecd4e58b7dc40\n\nThis spell is one I did on myself, sort of a manifestation out into the universe, however I feel like the components and ritual of it is very versatile so if there is anything you personally would want to add or take away, feel free! It may seem like a lot of ingredients, this is just things I have collected over time, don't rush out and buy everything to do this spell, it is not all necessary. The intention is just amplified by the objects we use in magic. \n\n  \nWhat I Used:\n\n**Candles:**\n\n* Red Taper and Chime Candles *(Love, Loyalty, Sexual Energy, Attraction, Passion)*\n* Pink Taper and Chime Candles *(Beauty, Affection, Love, Feminine Energy, Sensuality)*\n* Black Taper Candle *(Protection, Binding, Security, Spirituality, Strength)*\n* White Normal Candle *(Hope, Clarity, Higher Self, Cosmic Connection)*\n\n**Crystals:**\n\n* Rose Quartz *(Unconditional Love, Feminine Energy, Personal Fulfillment, Compassion, Healing)*\n* Selenite *(Cleansing, Peace, Purity, Love)*\n* Clear Quartz *(Divine Energy, Healing, Cosmic Connection, Harmony)*\n* Carnelian *(Clarity, Confidence, Self-Esteem, Courage, Creativity)*\n\n**Herbs:**\n\n* Rose *(Love, Protection, Passion, Healing, Beauty)*\n* Lavender (*Love, Attraction, Clarity, Peace)*\n* Cinnamon Bark *(Love, Luck, Prosperity, Healing, Protection, Lust)*\n\n**Misc:**\n\n* Rose Scented Incense\n* Rose Oil\n* Sweet Almond Oil\n* Cedar Bundle (for cleansing myself and my space)\n* Paper and Pen\n* Dish (to put herbs and candles in)\n* Lighter\n* Small Bottle\n* Glue (Optional; to keep jar shut)\n* Twine (Optional; to tie around finished jar)\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5hnfapc8roae1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=776cad5b62059b5cbe4345cadaa6f6f047d52ea1\n\n  \n***Setting Up The Spell Space***\n\nI used a small table I have and arranged my ingredients in a pleasing and practical way, there isn't much of a science to this part I just like having my materials accessible.\n\nI then took my cedar bundle and cleansed myself and my space with the smoke also taking this time to really solidify my state of mind and intentions for the spell.\n\nI used two small chime candles, one in red and one in pink, and melted the bottom a bit so they could stick to the bottle of the dish I would be using for the spell. Then I sprinkled in my herbs (rose, lavender, and cinnamon bark) I didn't specifically dress my candles, just surrounded them in the herbs I was using. I also added a small amount of rose oil and sweet almond oil to my herbs.\n\n  \n***The Ritual***\n\nAfter my herbs were set up I lit all of my candles saying my intention and purpose for each of them out loud as they were lit. For example when I lit the black candle I spoke that it was there for my protection during this spell and my safety as I feel the effects of it.\n\nI also lit my rose scented incense and spoke its intentions into the world, filling my world and my spirit with love.\n\nOnce everything has been lit I picked up my pen and paper and just started writing. I won't share exactly what I wrote but my intentions for this spell were to attract love to me, to become magnetic to the people I was interested in, and bring passion into my life. I wrote a small page basically manifesting the things I wanted, writing about them as if they were already true.\n\nOnce I had finished writing I folded my paper in three and poured some of the wax from my red and pink chime candles on it to seal it. I also took some of the herb mixture and pressed it into the wax.\n\nAfter my note to the universe had been sealed I took my rose quartz crystal and meditated with it, taking deep breaths and going over my manifestations to the universe. \n\n  \n***The Spell Jar***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7w46bcbroae1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=f926db06d8463a20a910638d86a1309ef2a1e492\n\nOnce I had finished meditating I took a small glass bottle I had to make a spell jar with this energy. I first filled the jar with smoke from the incense and then took some of my herbal mixture and put it in the bottle. Once it was full I glued the lid shut just to make sure it didn't spill and poured some of the wax from my red and pink chime candles over the top of the cork. I also tied a bow of twine around the neck of the jar just to fully seal my intentions.\n\n  \nAnd that's it! It felt great to do, I haven't done a full spell in quite a while, I sort of just made this one up, went based off my intuition and understanding of correspondence. Again, if there is anything you would want to add or take away feel free, make it fit your needs. Thank you very much for reading, message me or comment if you have any questions or try it yourself! I would love to hear! <3 Many Blessing to you all and Happy New Year!",

I had mentioned this in a Rant/Raves thread a few weeks back and I'm now at a point where i can give a full review of the **Clinique Even Better Brightening Moisture Mask.**\n\nMy skin is normal and tends to lean a bit on the dry side according to the weather. This is the first \"moisturizing mask\" that I've ever used. It retails for $36 and has 3.4 fl oz (100 ml) of product.\n\nIt has an exhaustive ingredient list. From nourishing, moisturizing ingredients like Sweet almond oil, squalene, capric tryglycerides, Glyceryl Stearate and cetearyl alcohol to antioxidants and anti-irritants like Chamomile flower extract,  Birch bark, chinese skullcap, cucumber, apple, barley and turmeric  extracts to name a few. I confess that this list is what attracted my attention and made me buy this product. *However, that also increases the allergic potential for sensitive skins so patch-testing is must!*\n\nIngredients: http://imgur.com/90bSA4K\n\n**How i use it:**\n\nI have been using this thrice a week since almost two months, roughly about a big pea-size for my face. It is pretty thick coming out of the tube and a bit difficult to apply. I spread a thin layer all over my face,  let it rest for about 20 seconds and then massage lightly all over my face. The body heat helps to spread it easily and evenly. Clinique advises to keep it on for 10 mins but I'm quite happy to break this rule :D I keep it on for about 45 mins to an hour and wash my face gently after the time is up.\n\nNow onto the **Performance:**\n\nIt is an excellent mask if you have dry, dehydrated or even normal skin. It gets absorbed completely and makes my skin supple. It gives my face that well-rested look.\n\nThe thing that I'm most excited to share with you all though is the effect this mask had on inflammation due to acne. I had a  hormonal breakout some time back and used this mask everyday for four days and the inflammation subsided much quicker than it normally does. Raised cysts flattened out quickly and it took care of redness like nobody's business. Needless to say, it did not aggravate my acne, nor did it give rise to any new ones.\n\nMakeup goes on exceedingly well after i use this; no dry patches, no redness at all. And did i mention how little is required every time? I reckon it's gonna last me ages, making it pretty cost-effective.\n\n\n**Tl;dr:** I love this mask. It goes above and beyond what it claims to do. It nourishes, moisturizes, plumps, calms and gives me that lit-from-within glow. It has become my HG mask and with the winter approaching, I'm sure I'm gonna love it even more.\n\n Let me know if I've missed something! :)",

When I adopted her from her previous owner she was 5 years old and covered in huge blackheads and lots of acne on her face and paws. Her blackheads have reduced since then but her pimples haven’t budged. When we bathe her we massage her with coconut oil then use an oatmeal shampoo with an exfoliating glove then moisturize with coconut oil and sweet almond oil. I’ve tried buying her medicated soaps and wipes, moisturizers, oils, and exfoliating. The white pustules sometimes pop if she scratches but most of them are skin colored bumps that rarely pop and just keep appearing on her body (mostly on her face/head and legs). \n\nI’ve asked a few vets about it and they said it might be allergies to her food or environment but even switching to homemade meals for the past year hasn’t helped. \n\nAnyone else experienced this? Any advice is really appreciated! ",

I can't shut up so prepare for this to be long.\n\nSkin type is dry-to-normal (I think I was incorrect in my previous post lmao). Prone to acne, blackheads, and hyperpigmentation. My main skincare goals are to heal hyperpigmentation, stay spot free, and do preventative anti-aging.\n\nI try not to spend more than £20 on any one product, but there are a couple of more expensive products in this routine. Prices are what I normally pay in Boots or direct from the manufacturer; exceptions are noted.\n\n**Routine summary**\n\n*Morning (generalised):* foaming cleanser --> exfoliator --> vitamin C serum --> 20 minute wait --> toner --> antioxidant serum --> moisturiser --> sunscreen\n\n*Morning (products):* Simple Micellar Gel Wash --> Drunk Elephant TLC Frambroos --> Hylamide C25 --> 20 minute wait --> Facetheory Cera-C toner --> Inkey List Q10 --> CeraVe Moisturising Lotion --> SunSense Ultra + Burt's Bees lip balm and/or Aquaphor\n\n*Evening (generalised):* cleansing balm --> foaming cleanser --> toner --> retinol serum --> moisturisng serum --> moisturiser --> facial oil\n\n*Evening (products):* The Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Balm --> Simple Micellar Gel Wash --> Facetheory Cera-C toner --> Indeed Labs Retinol Reface --> The Ordinary Buffet --> CeraVe Moisturising Lotion --> The Wild Rose Soap Company Face Serum\n\n*As needed:* Calamine & Glycerin cream (spot treatment), Burt's Bees lip balm, Aquaphor\n\n**Morning routine & reviews**\n\n*Simple Water Boost Micellar Gel Wash -* £5/150ml; key ingredients: gentle surfactants, panthenol\n\nI love this product. Definite repurchase. It has a really nice texture, it's slightly acidic, and it foams + removes easily. No scent at all which is my preference. I got it to replace the Boots Expert Sensitive Face Wash with Aloe Vera, which is slightly alkaline and was causing serious breakouts, scaly dry patches, and a raw red patch on my cheek; as soon as I switched cleansers my face started healing.\n\n*Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum -* £76/30ml; key ingredients: AHAs, salicylic acid, 12% combined concentration\n\nOkay, so serious caveat here: I received this as a gift from a friend. It was already open and I'm not sure how long it had been open for, so if I'd got it new I might have a different opinion. Having said that, I do not like this product. The packaging is neat (you twist the top and a little spout pops up to push down on), and I like the gel texture, but it is not nearly as effective as other exfoliators I've used. It makes my blackheads smaller, but does not eliminate them the way I would expect, especially from a luxury product. My budget does not stretch to £70+ skincare, but even if it did, I would not buy this again. Before this I was using The Ordinary 7% Glycolic Toner (£7) and a Neutrogena toner (£5) layered on top of each other for better results at literally a fifth of the price. (The Neutrogena toner, btw, DID get rid of my blackheads. Although it appears to be discontinued now, because we can't have nice things.)\n\n*Hylamide C25 -* £25/30ml; key ingredient: vitamin C (ethylated ascorbic acid), 25%\n\nAs far as results go, I like this product. I feel like it makes my skin glowier, and has helped fade PIH; not dramatically, but it's definitely helping. It's a little more expensive than I ideally like to spend on serums, but you only need a quarter of a dropper each time so it's going to last months. BUT - the propanediol base feels very sticky and petroleum-oily, and it lasts even after the rest of my routine. It's especially difficult to apply make up over, and gums up my make up brushes. And somewhat concerningly, it was scentless when I opened it, but with time has started to develop a slight \"burnt corn\" (I don't know how else to describe this) smell despite being stored in a shut cupboard in a cold room. I think it's still fine to use - I haven't experienced irritation or breakouts - but it's definitely not the \"completely stable\" formulation that Deciem claims it is. I would reluctantly repurchase this if I couldn't find anything better, but I'm going to seek a vitamin C serum that has equivalent results and a less annoying texture. Next on my list is the Inkey List Vit C + EGF serum.\n\n*20 minute wait*\n\nNot a product, but I definitely think that leaving a 20 minute wait after my low pH products has helped them work better. Definitely think I'm glowier since I started doing this! Can be hard to fit in in the morning; I normally use the time to eat breakfast in. (NB - Hylamide C25 doesn't have a traditional pH as it's a water free formulation, but in water ethylated ascorbic acid has a pH of 3 - 5 so I treat it like a low pH product.)\n\n*Facetheory Cera-C Toner -* £15/200ml; key ingredient: niacinamide, 5%\n\nMy main interest in incorporating this product into my routine was the niacinamide. It also has ceramides and a little bit of vitamin C, but I'm not so fussed about that. And it's fine! Perfectly nice toner. No scent, slightly viscous, slightly oily texture but not in a bothersome way, goes on best with fingers rather than a cotton pad. You only need a few drops each time so the bottle lasts forever. Pleasantly soothing after cleansing. There is nothing wrong with it and if it were the only toner in the world I would happily repurchase it indefinitely, but as is I'm getting a little bored. Going to try the Muji Toning Water or Hada Labo Hyaluronic Acid Lotion next, and get niacinamide in a separate serum.\n\n*The Inkey List Q10 serum -* £5/30ml; key ingredients: antioxidants, especially Q10\n\nThis is a lovely little serum. No scent, goes on easily with fingers. I don't notice a major change from this, but then I wouldn't expect to from an antioxidant serum. It's slightly moisturising and I do think it helps support my sunscreen and prevent further PIH. And it's a great price. The only thing wrong with it is that the packaging is very irritating; I normally store it upside down or I can't get the product out. Really needs a pump or something (I suspect the Niod pumps would fit so some Frankensteining might be in order). I've repurchased it a couple of times but I've realised that the Niod Survival 0 serum is only £20 (i.e. within budget) and has a much more exciting antioxidant profile, so I'm going to try that next. If you have £5 rather than £20 for a serum, then this is definitely a good option.\n\n*CeraVe Moisturising Lotion -* £9.50/236ml; key ingredients: ceramides, fatty alcohols\n\nI know this sub is all about CeraVe in the tub, but can we have some love for CeraVe with the pump? This is light, nourishing, and just gorgeous. No scent, no fuss, and no getting your grubby fingers in the product. Sinks in easily and sits well under make up. Possibly not *quite* heavy enough for the nighttime, but that's what facial oils are for. I often layer this on my lips as well. Have repurchased this once already and intend to do so again. One day I might want to play around with other moisturisers for variety and to satisfy my curiosity, but honestly I'll have trouble setting this aside.\n\n*SunSense Ultra -* £23/500ml from The Suncare Shop; key ingredients: niacinamide, SPF 50 (I used to get this for £20/500ml but it's gone up, boo)\n\nI am not about all these tiny fiddly sunscreens in 50ml bottles that will create mounds of plastic waste, especially as I use sunscreen on my body as well as my face. SunSense Ultra is a runny milk that sinks in easily, and one 500ml bottle will last me almost a whole year. It isn't sticky once it's on, but I do still notice it if I'm paying attention and it occasionally escapes into my eyes (although I do put it on my browbone underneath the eyebrow). I vastly prefer it to any drugstore sunscreen I've tried and have repurchased before. However, now Alturist comes in 200ml bottles I'm going to switch to that - Altruist is the best sunscreen I've ever tried and feels like nothing once it's on. I've long kept a 100ml Altruist bottle in my gym bag, but didn't want to make it my go to sunscreen and go through tons of plastic bottles. Bigger bottles means that Altruist is going to become my everyday sunscreen.\n\n**Evening routine & reviews**\n\n*The Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Balm -* £11/90ml\n\nThis is fine. It's a cleansing balm. Sometimes I get grits with it which is cool. Has a nice, silky texture which is good for an oil massage. I'm struggling for anything else to say about it - honestly it bores me. The main ingredients are ethylhexyl palmitate and synthetic wax which are the most boring ingredients imaginable. I'm going back to Lush Ultrabland - it's more expensive, but that almond oil+beeswax mix is much more enjoyable and nourishing.\n\n*Simple Water Boost Micellar Gel Wash* \\- as above\n\n*Facetheory Cera-C toner* \\- as above\n\n*Indeed Labs Retinol Reface* \\- £20/30ml; key ingredients: retinol, hydroxypinacolone retinoate (AKA granactive retinoid), palmitoyl oligopeptide, palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7\n\nI... think I like this? I'm not sure if it's making much of a difference to my face; the fine lines on my forehead (I'm 27 so they are very fine) seem like they're softening a little, but not much. I got better results with The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% but I didn't really want an oil format anymore. I do like that this one is mild enough to go all around my eyes, but part of me wants something stronger. I might repurchase, but I'd like to try a few more retinoids first and see how it goes. There aren't many well-reviewed retinoids out there for £20 or less though - recommendations welcome.\n\n*The Ordinary Buffet -* £24.10/60ml; key ingredients: amino acids, several forms of hyaluronic acid, sugars, urea, glycerin, PCA, oh yeah and I guess some peptides\n\nGiving the price for the larger size because that's what I buy because I love this. It's so good. It smells (faintly) like glue but I really could not care less because there is so much good stuff going on in here. I guess it's technically an anti-aging peptide serum, but that's not what I'm here for: I'm here for that good good moisturisation. Buffet really excels at that.\n\n*CeraVe Moisturising Lotion* \\- as above\n\n*The Wild Rose Soap Company Face Serum -* £12/30ml; key ingredients: squalane, grapeseed oil, cacay oil\n\nThis is a facial oil. It says it's a \"face serum\", and if you consider oils serums then that is accurate. But I would call it an oil. Moving on - I picked this up on a whim when buying shaving soap from the company, and I like it a lot more than I was expecting. The base is grapeseed which gives it a very light feel, and it smells faintly nutty (I guess from the cacay oil). It's pretty moisturising, and if it were available on the high street I would repurchase - but I don't like it enough to make a special order from the company each time. Intending to replace with Facetheory's Q10 oil.\n\n**As needed reviews**\n\n*Burt's Bees Lip Balm -* £4 each\n\nWhat is the point of this product. It leaves my lips no more moisturised than Vaseline. I got it as a gift and I hate it. Not sure if I'll even use it up. Next up for me is Nuxe Reve de Miel or Dr Pawpaw depending on how flush I'm feeling.\n\n*Eucerin Aquaphor* \\- £9/45ml; key ingredients: petrolatum, lanolin, panthenol\n\nI tried this after reading about it on The Acid Queen Blog and... I love it. It's so much better than Vaseline. It's fine on lips (especially over a different moisturiser), but I think it really shines on small wounds and especially on damaged cuticles. My cuticles are prone to being flaky nightmares and this has really helped me fix them. I also used it as an occlusive layer when I was fixing my skin from the Boots Expert face wash, and it really helped heal my red, sore skin. I balked at the price at first, but this tiny bottle has lasted me several months thus far. Going to rebuy forever.\n\n*Calamine & Glycerin cream -* £1.60/35g; key ingredients: zinc oxide 5%, calamine, glycerin\n\nA while ago everyone on this sub was buzzing about nappy cream and other high zinc oxide creams for spots, and I happened to see this in Boots so thought I'd give it a shot. Friends. It's so good. I put it on active breakouts and it brings the inflammation and redness right down. It's occlusive and high in glycerin, so it doesn't dry out or irritate the skin surrounding the spot; it just works. Especially effective on whiteheads which it dries right out. When I have an active whitehead, I dab a thick layer on right before bed and wipe off any reside in the morning. I also put a thin layer on shaving rash, which it works wonders on too - I think it would do well on any inflamed skin. And it's one. Pound. Sixty.\n\nAnd now for a bunch of stuff that isn't pictured.\n\n**Tools**\n\n*Reusable cotton rounds -* I cannot remember where I got these from or how much they cost but I like them a lot. They have a somewhat scrubby surface that exfoliates wonderfully. Nothing in the above routine requires them, but I miss them; I need to find something that works with cotton rounds!\n\n*Facetheory bamboo cloths* \\- £7.25 for 3 - I tried some cheaper face cloths and they were inadequate. These are good. Very good. Especially after a few washes when they get delightfully soft.\n\n**Body care**\n\n*Bioderma Atoderm Nourishing Cream* \\- £18.50/500ml - my current body moisturiser. I use it daily. It is great. Hasn't 100% cleared up, but definitely very much helped, the keratosis pilaris on my arms. The pump is efficient. The price is reasonable. It does exactly what I want a body cream to do without making a fuss.\n\n*Bioderma Atoderm Shower Oil* \\- £8.80/200ml - I've never used a shower oil before so this has very strong novelty value. It's quite fun, but I feel like I'm getting through it quickly and it's kind of pricey. Going to switch back to regular shower gel.\n\n**Hands and feet**\n\n*CCS Foot Care Cream* \\- £8/175ml - I put this on my feet every night before I go to bed and it helps keep the hard skin at bay. It has 10% urea which I think is a major part of this, as well as lactic acid.\n\n*Footner Exfoliating Socks* \\- £20/pair - for when CCS is not enough! Every couple of months my feet spend an hour in this bag of alcohol and acid, and then over the next week all the dead skin peels off. It's gross and satisfying and gives me beautiful feet. I've tried a few cheaper options; Footner still reigns supreme.\n\n*Sweet almond oil -* £5/100ml from Holland & Barrett - I put this on my cuticles when I get out of the shower and rub it in. It's moisturising and good and helps prevent my cuticles returning to hangnail hell. I was using squalane which I think is slightly better but also several times more expensive; so I'm going to stick to the almond oil.\n\n**Shaving**\n\nI'm currently using a double edge razor with Gillette Platinum blades. I still get some shaving rash though. :( For shave soap I have *The Wild Rose Soap Company Fragrance Free Shaving Soap* (£8/130g), and I don't rate it. It doesn't foam up as much as I'd like and even though there's water in it there aren't any preservatives?! This gives it a preposterously short shelf life, which I think it's already surpassed even though I haven't used all that much of it. I suspect this is contributing to my shaving rash, which has been getting worse recently; I'm likely to throw it out and try something else. Probably going to keep the tin and put a different brand's shaving puck in there.\n\nSomething which does help is *Lifeplan Aloe Vera Gel* (£8/200ml). I apply it immediately after shaving and before the Bioderma, and it helps soothe the skin.\n\n**Haircare** (scalps are skin, right?)\n\nI'm using a cheap misc shampoo from Boots which I don't like much and will replace when it runs out. My hair's quite short so conditioner tends to make it quite limp; instead I'm using *grapeseed oil* (£4/100ml from Holland & Barrett). I slather on a good handful before washing it, and then add just a few drops immediately after washing when my hair is still wet, massaging it all through my scalp and hair. Keeps it soft and happy.\n\n**Mindfulness**\n\nNot a product, but I don't think this is an aspect of skincare that gets discussed enough. I use my evening routine as a time to do mindfulness meditation, and focus very deeply on the sensory experience of doing skincare. The sound of running water. The feel of my hands on my face. The different colours in the packaging of my products. If my mind drifts, that's okay; I simply bring it back to my routine when I can. I definitely feel better for it - even though it's only 5 or 10 minutes a day, doing it regularly gives me a core of tranquility and peace. There is so much evidence that mindfulness is good for you, and if you've never tried it then I strongly recommend you do.\n\nIf you got to the bottom of this then well done you! I hope it was useful. I enjoyed typing it even if no one reads it. :D",

        "body": "This was such a delight to read! I am all about informative and meandering knowledge-sharing.\n\nYour two sunscreen recs interest me. I am so bad about wearing sunscreen, because I absolutely loathe the feeling + smell. It is so sensorily unpleasant and distracting. These look much more tolerable. Sadly they seem difficult to get in the US.\n\nFor shaving cream — have you ever tried the hair conditioner trick? I feel like this has been floating around on those “Stripper Beauty Tricks” threads forever. I thought it would irritate my skin, so I didn’t try it until about a month ago. But holy shit, it works! Closest shave I’ve ever gotten and super cheap, too. \n\nI am using [this](https://www.garnierusa.com/about-our-brands/fructis/triple-nutrition/triple-nutrition-conditioner) Garnier Triple Nutrition conditioner. I wouldn’t use this on my actual hair; honestly, I chose this just because it was on sale for like $2 at the time. I think it works just because the slip is so good. Normal shaving cream or butter or whatever doesn’t remove as much of the friction of the razor on my skin, thus exacerbating my skin’s complaints. I have fast-growing black hair so I shave most every day. The conditioner experiment has made it a slightly more tolerable process. (Although watch out — it does make the shower floor more slippery. Rinse thoroughly.)\n\nFinally, I love the point you bring up about mindfulness. I’m just recently getting back into skin care after a looooong hiatus. I haven’t settled into a routine long enough to see physical results yet, but the self-care aspect of it has been immediately gratifying. It honestly feels like an indulgence, and I like the ritual. Going to try to incorporate a little mini meditation within these minutes as well.",

I noticed that even though the acne comes and goes, the marks (PIH) did not. And that I looked several years older than I am. (Who would have guessed drinking, not sleeping and stress ages a person, right? =P) I stopped binge drinking and tried to sleep more but it didn't reverse the damage, so I looked into skincare further. After finding this sub, my skin has improved dramatically.

Some good options include:\n\n1. **Argan Oil**: Lightweight and easily absorbed, providing moisture without greasiness.\n2. **Grapeseed Oil**: Very light and helps to seal in moisture without feeling heavy.\n3. **Jojoba Oil**: Mimics the natural oils of the scalp, promoting healthy hair.\n4. **Sweet Almond Oil**: Penetrates the hair shaft easily and provides nourishment.\n5. **Apricot Kernel Oil**: Light and non-greasy, great for moisturizing and softening hair.\n\nThese oils can help keep low porosity hair hydrated and healthy without causing buildup.",

The fact that I live in a humid environment also makes it worse, with tons of flyaways to manage. \n\n\nI've been very consistent with squish-to-condish and microplopping, with great results: until now, my hair naturally forms uniform waves when wet.

First pic was my hair two hrs after washing it... I still need to use some heat or otherwise part of my scalp won't dry. \n\n\nI've never used gel in a wash routine so I'm not sure whether it would be suitable for my hair. I apply sweet almond oil or Alverde Repair & Care with Avocado Oil and Shea butter. I'm trying to limit my usage of products to avoid build-up, since pollution already weighs hair down.

The fragrance features notes of: Whiskey, Heliotrope, Dark Plum, Leathers, Suede, Tobacco Flower, Dark Tobacco Leaf, Papyrus, Benzoin, Labdanum, Vanilla, Animal Musk, Patchouli & Tuberose. APR is at the pinnacle of fragrancing in the wet shaving world and Fenchurch shows off this skill in spades. The fragrance is masculine and luxurious and feels and smells like a designer fragrance. Scent strength is mid to strong off the soap and remains this way throughout the process. I am unable to provide anything similar for comparisons as this fragrance is so unique.   \nAPR’s F2 soap base features the addition of lots of skin food. The new ingredients list reads as: Stearic Acid, Aqua, Glycerin, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Allantoin, Citric Acid, Silk Protein. The soap is fairly firm and loading it is easy regardless of what fiber brush you choose. The soap is thirsty, but not in a cumbersome way. The lather is dense, similar to cold sour cream with a vibrant sheen. The slickness is excellent both primary and residual. The post shave is a noticeable improvement from the previous base and it leaves the skin as soft and supple as you could ask for. The F2 base comes in with a shavescore of 94. Soaps with a shavescore and experience similar to this are Grooming Dept and Wholly Kaw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Reserve Fenchurch (gift)\n* Brush - Mocek “Calypso” (purchased)\n* Razor - Through the Fire Fine Crafts “Funky Frequency” (purchased)\n* Post - Reserve Fenchurch (gift) \n\n[Edit - corrected AU third party reseller]",

I was just wondering what your opinion is on this particular Artisan as we all love the care and detail you put into your reviews and know that it’s the real deal not some troll looking to stir up trouble. I have an idea for you, not sure how exactly you would go about it but here goes. Try That Soap is an unbelievable resource for our community as far as helping folks curate their Den, as well as try new stuff. My idea would be for you to create a Master Lather Score sheet and update if a new base is available from a particular Artisan, might be a way for a Cliffs Notes version for people to check out your wonderful work. Thanks again for the great review, have a great day!",

    "body": "Waitrose have a skin/hair care line called 'Pure' which is fragrance free, hypoallergenic, cruelty free and uses mostly 'naturally derived' ingredients, whatever that means. It's also really cheap, and regularly on offer. I know this isn't a hair care sub, but their shampoo and conditioners are fab, and extremely good value. The dry/damaged conditioner is how I make it up to my hair for bleaching it to all hell. \n\nAnyway, I got a few of the skincare products a few months ago when they were doing 3 for 2. They're now on 1/3 off, so I thought I'd post some mini-reviews. \n\nI would describe my skin as oily, somewhat congested, and quick to anger. It’s also probably somewhat dehydrated by bad office aircon and just, like, winter in general. \n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Hot Cloth Cleanser** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-hot-cloth/508007-539993-539994\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Candelilla Cera, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa Powder, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Aqua, Tocopherol,  Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Phytate\n\n**Verdict:** God, I wanted to like this. I love hot cloth cleansers, and this one was so simple and cheap - and it even comes with a cloth! However, the rice powder totally ruins it for me - using a face cloth is exfoliating enough, and I don’t want even a gentle scrub on my face. If you are super into scrubbing your face, this might be perfect - it’s not going to rip you to shreds like walnut shells, and it’s not illegal  and murderous like microbeads. \n\nI was very sad about this until I realised that what I did now have was a super-luxurious body scrub. I used it the other day - I spent a long time massaging it into dry skin before taking a hot shower and washing it all off with a sponge. Because the cleanser’s so rich, my skin was very soft and moisturised afterwards, and a couple of days later the patches of KP I had were almost gone. I might do it again next weekend - it’s not really a weekday type thing because rubbing it all in takes ages, washing it all off also takes ages, and they’re both kind of the point (it’s sort of like a soothing diy massage) so you don’t want to hurry it.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Facial Oil** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-facial-oil/862289-541045-541046\n\n**Ingredients:** Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil,  Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Prunus Persica Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid\n\n**Verdict:** Blergh. I sometimes do really well with facial oils - I really love the Boots Botanics Organic one - but this was just a nope all round. Bar the absence of smell, it just feels like I rubbed coconut oil into my skin. I shine with a thin film of grease. I might try it on my hair, maybe? Or try doing the OCM with it? I will say this, the packaging’s nice - a lovely frosted glass bottle - so I suppose if nothing else I can empty it out and put other things into it. As you can see, I’m trying really hard to find positives here.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Day Cream SPF 15** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-day-cream-spf-15/450717-539849-539850\n(It says ‘this product is unavailable’ but it’s definitely for sale in multiple shops.)\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Zinc Oxide (Nano), Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Simmondsia Chinesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Phenoxyethanol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Aluminum Stearate, Sodium Phytate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isostearic Acid, Alumina, Methylpropanediol, Tocopherol, Sodium Hydroxide, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Disostearate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate\n\n**Verdict:** Hell to the yeah. I really really love this moisturiser, and have just rebought it as I’m getting near the bottom of the jar and it’s on offer again. I think it’s just that my skin is a big fan of zinc oxide, since I find that Sudocrem also calms my skin down a whole bunch. It’s thick and creamy, and feels very protective against the winter wind, and it’s the only thing that seems capable of withstanding a day in the weird dry recirculated air in my office. It’s not every day you find a physical-only sunscreen for such a low price, either, even if it is only SPF15. There’s a slight whiteness as you rub it in, and people with darker skin tones might find it leaves a cast - I’m not sure, as I haven’t noticed one, but my underlying skin colour’s quite pale and so it’s not always visible on me. On days when I especially don’t care about ruining the SPF aspect (ie most days right now because it’s deepest winter and I’m barely leaving the house anyway) I will often mix in a bit of Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nThe Pure Natural line is even cheaper. In particular, I think it’s great that they offer some really basic thick face creams with no fragrance. I’m probably going to try out their SLS free face wash at some point.",

Does anyone have any recommendations for a perfume like this?\n\nIt isn't particularly soapy. The website that sells it describes it as \"subtle, intoxicating scent—clean, natural florals with a hint of warmth and sweetness.\" I definitely also can smell the chamomile specifically and the egg gives it a creamy lactonic base that makes it  almost a gourmand. Almost like a light floral cool egg custard scent, there definitely is something sweet there, without the spice note I find in some lactonic scents like Commodity Milk. To me this is like sitting down to eat a cold cup of homemade egg custard with a cold glass of chamomile tea.\n\nRetailer also includes this: \"Key Ingredients: natural vegetable base, water, eggwhite powder, chamomile flowers, and sweet almond oil.\" I think that almond oil might contribute to the gourmand feel of this. I really don't get vanilla too much.\n\nAbout me: I'm kind of difficult when it comes to gourmands. I enjoy a candy or fruit scent but anything cake or bread really has never hit for me. (I like a lot of Luvmilk's products but reallllly don't like my sample of Kneady Kitten.)\n\nThis is the retailer if anyone is curious: [https://www.kalastyle.com/collections/bar-soaps/products/eggwhite-facialsingle-retail](https://www.kalastyle.com/collections/bar-soaps/products/eggwhite-facialsingle-retail)",

I’ve been trying out a lot of things and I think I’ve finally found a routine that works for me:\n\n\n- Before getting in the shower, I use Veet hair removal cream (with urea)\n\nI’ve been told that this hair removal cream helps dissolving those pesky keratin plugs that make your skin feel textured and it might be true! My legs are ridiculously soft each time I use it. I was never a hair removal cream type of person, I preferred waxing, but my legs actually feel way softer now and the bumps don’t get irritated. I do this once a week. \n\n- I apply a chemical peel.\n\nYes I do this before showering. I’ve found that applying it after the shower and then layering my skin products on top of it makes my skin feel weird. I use The Ordinary Lactid Acid or The Ordinary Salicylic Acid toner. I think I prefer the Lactid Acid as it gives me better results but I ran out so I’m using the Salicylic Acid for now. I let that sit for a while while I brush my teeth etc. and then I hop in the shower. \n\n\n- I take cold showers\n\nHot showers make my skin extremely dry. I already felt an immediate difference after my first cold shower. It’s summer time now, but I’m going to try to always shower with cold water from now on. I don’t do much physical exfoliation other than using my loofah. Sometimes I’ll do a scrub when I feel like it but very gently because physical exfoliation usually just irritates my skin. \n\n- I apply my creams while my skin is still damp. \n\nI pat my skin dry until it’s slightly damp and then I put on a 8% Urea cream from my local drugstore. I wish I could plug it because it is literally amazing but you can only get it if you live in the Benelux.  It kinda smells like piss but it makes me feel soft like a baby. I literally can’t remember a time my skin was ever this soft. I apply a lightweight sweet almond oil on top to lock everything in and also for the scent because it smells really good. \n\n- Exposing my legs to sunlight. \n\nI don’t know what it is, but summer is a really good season for KP. I was so terrified to bare my legs before because I didn’t want to get stared at, but I’m trying to get over it. The appearance of my legs doesn’t bother me anymore, it’s the texture that I would like to work on. And sunlight definitely works! I wouldn’t say go tanning, since that has its own health risks but going for a walk has worked for me.",

It uses powdered milk so the shelf life is decent, although I tend to go through the batch in a few weeks. \n\n\nAdapted from The Witch’s Book of Self Care by Arin Murphy-Hiscock\n\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 1/2 C powdered milk\n- 1/2 C Epsom Salt\n- 1/2 C Cornstarch\n- 1/2 C Baking Soda\n- 1/4 C ground oats or oat flour\n- 1/4 C powdered honey\n- 1 T dried rose petals\n- 1 T dried lavender \n- 1 T dried calendula\n- 1 T infused herbal oil (or oil of choice, sweet almond oil or avocado oil works great!)\n- Essential oils or fragrance of choice\n\n\nMix all dry ingredients except dried flowers until combined. Separately mix infused oil and essential oil or fragrance and then slowly add to dried ingredients while mixing well. It can take a while to mix the oils in evenly, I like to use a whisk as it wants to clump at first. It should be a relatively dry powder still. Lastly, gently stir in the dried flowers. I like to grind them a bit before adding, as I don’t like large flower clumps in my bath. \n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\nI add about a cup of this to my running bath water and mix it up with my hands until the clumps are dissolved. \n\n\nThe herbal oils are optional but really let you change the nature of what you want from the bath! I like to use calendula infused oil for all around skin care, or arnica oil for sore muscles or chronic pain. Totally customizable though! \n\n\nThis also goes for the type of milk! Powdered milk is available is tons of options, coconut if you avoid animal products (can leave out the honey too), goat milk is definitely on my list to try too!\n\n\nHope this helps!",

    "body": "I am very into German musicals despite not speaking German and one of my favorites is called simply *Elisabeth* which is about the last Austrian Empress, Elisabeth. If her only son hadn't committed suicide without an heir, Franz Ferdinand wouldn't have become heir to the Austrian empire and who knows, maybe WWI/WW2 would have gone differently.\n\nShe is most famous for the series of Austrian films about her which were made before it was known how deeply unhappy she was at court. They depict her life as much more lighthearted, and not about her deep depression and unhappiness of the restriction of court, her possible eating disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder, the murder-suicide her son committed, the death of her first daughter in young childhood, the fact that she wasn't allowed to raise her own children, etc. They also referred to her as Sissi, when her nickname was always spelled Sisi.\n\nPerhaps because she had so little control over her own life, she had an extreme beauty routine and diet. She prided herself on her appearance, maybe because she was thought of as ugly in her childhood. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Winterhalter_Elisabeth_2.jpg) is the most famous portrait of her ever done. She refused to have photographs taken of her or to sit for portraits after age 32, however a few were taken without her knowledge. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Last-photo-of-empress-elisabeth.jpg) is the last known photo of her, taken at age 60, the day before her assassination (she was stabbed with a file, however her corset was laced so tightly that she didn't bleed out at the scene and they didn't realize she had been stabbed at first). She once said  “Ah, the horror of growing old, to feel the hand of Time laid upon one’s body, to watch the skin wrinkling, to awake and fear the morning light, and to know that one is no longer desirable! Life without beauty would be worthless to me.” \n\nSpending three hours a day getting her hair done, going for intense walks for ten hours at a time, eating very little to the point where she weighed about 100 pounds and stood at 5'8'' tall were normal for her. \n\nHer skincare regimen was also intense. Wikipedia describes it as:\n\n>Unlike other women of her time, Elisabeth used little cosmetics or perfume, as she wished to showcase her natural beauty, but she tested countless beauty products prepared in the court pharmacy, or prepared by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments, to preserve it. Although one favorite, \"Crème Céleste\", was compounded from white wax, spermaceti, sweet almond oil, and rosewater; she attached far less importance to creams and emollients, and experimented with a wide variety of facial tonics and waters, from which she apparently expected more results. Elisabeth slept without a pillow on a metal bedstead, all the better to retain her upright posture, with either raw veal or crushed strawberries lining her nightly leather facial mask. She was heavily massaged and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist, and her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water. To further preserve her skin tone, she took both a cold shower every morning (which in later years aggravated her arthritis) and an olive oil bath in the evening.\n\nShe also used cold cream made for her with \"beeswax, sweet almond oil, rosewater and cocoa butter\" and \"a cream made with lard, marshmallow roots and ground slugs\". From [here](http://www.beautifulwithbrains.com/the-beauty-secrets-of-empress-sissi/)\n\nMy question is (I'm not seeking to emulate her), did this skincare routine do her any good? She obviously looks pretty good for sixty in the last photo of her ever taken, but did those ingredients help?\n\n",

As a law enforcement officer in the Saint Louis area, the artisan is looking to make a great shaving product for consumers while also raising funds for families that have lost loved ones in the line of duty. First Line Shave will be donating a portion of all sales to the The Backstoppers Inc. (https://backstoppers.org/). This organization raises  funds to benefit the families of fallen first responders in the St. Louis Mo area. This set releases on October 3rd only at Firstlineshave.com. Shave soap, Aftershave, EDP and 7 numbered Grizzly Bay Brushes with custom Razor Ruby coin will be available. For other sourcing options of the standard line, you can find First Line Shave at Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nRazor Ruby is inspired by Xerjoff's Nio. The fragrance features notes of; Green notes, Bergamot, Neroli, Nutmeg, Cardamon, Pink Pepper, Jasmine, Vetiver, Patchouli, Woodsy notes and Amber. Having never smelled the cologne inspiration, I can only offer that the scent opens with bright tart bergamot and spicy cardamom and pink pepper. The neroli adds a creaminess to the mix. The backbone of woods and resin round out the entire accord nicely. Mrs. Ruds approves of this scent and finds it sexy and well suited for date night. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the container and for the shave’s duration. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Fine Accoutrements L'Orange Noir as a comparable scent profile.     \n\nFirst Line Shave has updated their soap base to FLS 2.0. This base features the addition of goats milk and remains based in tallow. Ingredients are listed as: Beef Tallow, Goats Milk, Aqua, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Jojoba Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Xanthan Gum, Shea Butter, Kokum Butter, Murumuru Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Cupuacu Butter, Cocoa Butter, Fragrance Oil, Kaolin Clay, Tussah Silk. This soap base is mid firm and a mindlessly easy loader. It is thirsty, but not the thirstiest base. When dialed in, the lather feels like sour cream. Slickness in terms of both primary and residual slickness are excellent. Post shave is dramatically improved and is now elite. This is not an incremental base improvement, this is an overhaul. As such First Line Shave FLS 2.0 receives a ShaveScore of 95. For similar performance from a soap base, I suggest: Declaration (bison) and Wholly Kaw (donkey milk). \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - First Line Shave Razor Ruby (promotional gift)\n* Brush - ​Mozingo Brushworks “Darkside” (purchased)\n* Razor - Wellington (purchased)\n* Post - First Line Shave Razor Ruby (promotional gift)",

APR is widely considered one of the premier perfumers in the wet shaving space, and Dan’s passion for this shines through in his scent creations and brash descriptions of the scents. Australian Private Reserve can be sourced directly from their website and also at: Maggard Razors (www.maggardrazors.com), West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)) and Beard & Blade Supply Co. ([https://www.beardandblade.com.au/](https://www.beardandblade.com.au/)).\n\nLes Santals is a celebration of sandalwood. The fragrance features: Indian Sandalwood and Autralian Sandalwood. The scent is balanced to perfection and paints a masterpiece of creamy woodiness with a slight powdery pop. There are few scent notes as well known or used in men’s fragrances as sandalwood, and this offering puts the scent on full display. Mrs. Ruds is not a fan of straight sandalwood scents, so it is no surprise that she didn’t like me wearing this. Strength of scent is strong out of the container and remains strong once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends The Club The City and Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Supreme Sandalwood Science as similar scent profiles.  \n\nAPR’s soap base features an ingredients list that reads as: Stearic Acid, Aqua, Glycerin, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Allantoin, Citric Acid, Silk Protein. The soap is fairly firm and loading it is easy regardless of what fiber brush you choose. The soap is thirsty, but not in a cumbersome way. The lather is dense, similar to cold sour cream with a vibrant sheen. The slickness is excellent both primary and residual. The post shave is also excellent, as it leaves the skin as soft and supple as you could ask for. The APR soap base comes in with a ShaveScore of 94. Soaps with a ShaveScore and experience similar to this are Noble Otter and Tallow + Steel.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Australian Private Reserve Les Santals (loaner)\n* Brush - Declaration Grooming Jefferson Unicorn Ivory (loaner)\n* Razor - Dovo “Best Quality” (gift)\n* Post - Australian Private Reserve Les Santals (loaner)",

    "body": "Here are some various lotions and balms from Dollar Tree, drug stores (i.e. Walgreens) and Ulta which I’ve tried to organize left to right, top to bottom from lightweight to medium and heavier. Some are empty, others halfway or new to me. \n\n> Skin type: oily, acne prone. Lately dry because of (over)using actives. \n\n##Watery gel\n * Peter Thomas Roth - Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer. New to me. Humectant forward, nice at first but burns a bit after a while if by itself. I think layering it with a moisturizer should be fine. I don’t understand the 30% hyaluronic complex claim—isn’t this ingredient usually only at 1%? \n* (Dollar Tree) B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream. Supposed to dupe the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel (I haven’t tried that one). Similar to the Peter Thomas Roth, not that friendly to my skin, and doesn’t smell as nice (like a baby powder smell). But this one actually is a pretty good as a makeup remover cold cream which can remove eyeliner. \n\n##Gel cream \n* (Dollar Tree) Global Beauty Care - Lift and Firm Eye Cream with Collagen and Peptides. Actually a very nice serum texture. The 0.5 oz lasts a while. I just used as a lightweight face moisturizer instead of eye cream. While I’d want a larger size I would get this texture again. \n* Nivea Breathable body lotion in scent Tropical Breeze. New to me. I got this as people said it’s light enough to be a face lotion, and it’s true, it’s very light. Too light for body really. I have some issues with this one. Perhaps my skin is currently compromised (it’s dry), but there is a consistent cooling feeling to the lotion, that sometimes also feels a bit burning. I don’t know what ingredient it is. It’s interesting there’s a vitamin c derivative sodium ascorbyl phosphate though. The scent is nice like a floral rose, geranium, jasmine type scent, that is true that it smells like Glad Air Freshener, which I happen to like. \n* Gold Bond - Pure Moisture daily body and face lotion. This didn’t work for me as a hand cream (not moisturizing enough). Slightly thin so it does also go by fast. But I started to love it when I thought of it as a face lotion instead. Layers nicely with other lotions too. I’m interested in repurchasing as it comes in large value sizes, although it appears this product may be on the way out in some stores. Seems a great value. \n\n##Lightweight lotion \n* Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion. Similar story to Gold Bone Pure Moisture, didnt value it until I thought of it as a lightweight face lotion instead of for body. This is a nice but plain light lotion. I’ve heard the ceramides complex might not be in an amount to help skin recovery that much. But it’s nice enough anyway. The Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair is a pretty similar product on skin. \n* Vaseline - Intensive Care Soothing Hydration. I liked the Vaseline Advanced Repair unscented a lot so tried this one. I like its cucumber melon type scent. But similar to the Nivea Breathable lotion (above), it has a cooling sensation but also can burn at times, especially on my face which is also currently sensitized. It seems fine for body. \n* The Beauty of Eczema - Moisturizing Cream. Rebranded as a “daily moisturizer,” this independent business which started on Instagram has since closed shop. The moisturizer is quite lightweight but also has sweet almond oil as the second ingredient, making the feel similar to a face oil/lotion hybrid. Not as moisturizing as something with dimethicone or petrolatum (like Cerave Daily Moisturizer or Vaseline Advanced Repair), but did not cause any breakouts. I didn’t find this to be “enough” in winter time but I loved the natural rose scent, just so much like the flower. I don’t have eczema btw. \n\n##Moderate lotion \n* Cetaphil - Moisturizing Lotion. New to me. A bit scared to put on my face as I’ve heard people have had breakouts. But it does seem to moisturize for a long time (applied to hands) and doesn’t cause sensitivity. The pump is a bit annoying as it locks when you turn it 45 degrees and also doesn’t dispense a lot for body use (but enough for face). \n* (Dollar Tree) Dermasil - Eczema Relief Body Lotion with chamomile flower and colloidal oatmeal. Moisturizes well for face and body. Possibly caused stinging once but has been fine after that. Has a light herbal scent kinda like dead flowers (pelargonium graveolens oil), but not bad. \n* (Dollar Tree) Kissable - Diabetics Dry Skin Relief Lotion. Has 30% petrolatum and 1% dimethicone as active ingredient skin protectant. Unscented. Actually love how this moisturizes and has a slight gel feel. It’s similar to Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion but less emollients (no oils). I am comfortable using for face and hands. \n\n##Thicker lotion \n* Alba - Very Emollient Body Lotion. Has a big variety of oils. Actually a godsend for when my nails are dried out because of Bath and Body Works hand soaps, dish detergents and bleach cleaners. Makes nails glossy. But uses a plant based emulsifier (glyceryl stearate SE) so it takes a long time to rub in, where a dimethicone would cut down that time. Seems great as a hand cream rather than a body lotion… takes too long after a shower on damp skin. \n* Gold Bond - Age Renew Retinol Overnight for face and body. Definitely thicker than the Gold Bond Pure Moisture. Has shea butter. Makes my skin soft in the morning (especially with Vaseline on top). Doesn’t seem to cause acne strangely enough. Has a texture like Hempz hand cream. I like this lotion especially in winter. \n* Eucerin - Eczema Relief Cream with 1% colloidal oatmeal. A good balance between a lighter and thicker cream. Doesn’t seem to cause issues. I don’t have eczema but liked this for drier skin days on face and body. \n\n##Cream \n* Lumin - Face Moisturizer for Oily and Normal Skin. A similar thickness to Gold Bond Age Renew Retinol Overnight, except a little more like a gel cream. This is an interesting one as there’s a stickiness similar to Cosrx Snail Mucin (but doesn’t have that ingredient) but also has meadow foam seed oil high in the ingredients list. Enjoyable to use. Is a men’s marketed product and has a citronella scent like bugs spray but also the Belif Aqua Bomb fragrance (not the texture). 1 oz but does take a while to use up. \n* Lumin - Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin. The same as above but includes more meadow foam seed oil (second ingredient) for a somewhat thicker balm. I believe both of these are made in Korea and they do remind me of K-beauty products with the long ingredients lists full of plant extracts to match. \n\n##Balm \n* La Roche Posay - Cicaplast Balm B5. Unscented but kinda smells like white out paint. It’s a white color that takes a bit to rub in, probably because of the zinc Gluconate which I hear does have healing properties. Had madecassoside which is the chemical form of centella. 1% dimethicone is listed as skin protectant (similar to the Dollar Tree Kissable one above). Seems to have great ingredients, but is just expensive and the 1.35 oz goes by quickly for me. Looking for alternative. \n* Cerave - Healing Ointment. Lasts a long time. It’s nice, I like it. A different feel than Aquaphor but similar in its skin protectant qualities. Both of them changed temperature after a particularly hot day though (the Aquaphor became runny and he Cerave became gritty). \n* (Dollar Tree) Revitalizing Body Balm Jelly Stick. Probably meant as a dupe to the Vaseline petroleum jelly stick. Haven’t tried that one but from reviews I’m guessing it’s similar. This is a nice way to put petroleum jelly on nails but tends to get dirty otherwise and is sort of a bit stiff so it can take other product off. \n* (Dollar Tree) Personal Care 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly (not pictured). I got this after the jelly stick, and like how it’s softer and more spreadable for face. It’s unscented but does have a small bit of cocoa butter taste (I think they also sell a cocoa butter iteration). \n\n##Repurchase?\n* ✅ I would buy these again: Gold Bond Pure Moisture, Gold Bond Retinol Overnight, Kissable Diabetics Dry Skin Relief (awesome find), Cerave Healing Ointment, and also Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair (not pictured) as a Cerave Daily Moisturizer alternative as it’s cheaper. I’ll try putting the Alba Very Emollient in a hand cream tube as I think it works great for that purpose specifically. I have it in my bathroom in the meantime. \n* ⚪️ I’d find some alternatives for the other ones as I like to try new products and find great deals. Specifically want a La Roche posay cicaplast replacement (is Triple Paste butt cream good enough?). It’s not that I saw results, it’s just people say this is their holy grail, and I don’t think I was able to go ham on it as it cost 💲💲to my budget ass. \n* ❌ I would avoid: Nivea Breathable and Vaseline Soothing Aloe as my skin seems sensitive to something about these two (fragrance?), especially in my skin’s current somewhat compromised state. \n\n\n\n",

While already known for their mastery of fragrance and very good soap base. Having recently celebrates their 3rd anniversary, APR released a scent set named Fourgere Trois. This project has been in the works for years and is a ground up reflection and modernization of the famed 1882 Fougere Royale. APR can be purchased direct from their site and also internationally at the following stockists: Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)).\n\nFougere Trois is an aromatic fougere and as mentioned above, it aims to reflect upon the fragrance that stated the genre, 1882 Fougere Rolyale. Rather than recreate it or try and duplicate it, APR decided to reflect on the scent, celebrate the scent and perhaps modernize it. Top Notes Include: Lavender, Bergamot, Clarysage & Petitgrain. Heart Notes Include : Geranium, Heliotrope, Rose, Orchid & Carnation. Base notes Include: Oakmoss, Tonka, Musk, Vanilla & Hay. While familiar and classic, this fougere is also unique and stunning. As a lover of the genre, I am impressed. Mrs. Ruds turned her nose to this one, but that is to be expected. Scent strength is mid-strong on this offering. Similar scents from wet shaving are: Barrister’s Reserve Fern. \n\nAPR’s F2 soap base features the addition of lots of skin food. The new ingredients list reads as: Stearic Acid, Aqua, Glycerin, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Allantoin, Citric Acid, Silk Protein.

The EdP gives a more forward powdery scent that's persistent but is still light and fresh, just a bit different than the soap. Rud's spot on regarding the slickness & residual slickness, one of the best performers all around IMO.\n\nEdP will pair well with any lighter more traditionally scented soaps such as MWF, Tabac & La Savonniere du Moulin, but would go great with most foguere scented soaps. It was really nice pairing with Torchwood, which I didn't think I would like after a sniff off the puck, but damn, it's a really fine woody scent!",

F2 is so great, and can really be tweaked to one's liking with its massive water tolerance. I've been singing praises about Australian Private Reserve for the past couple of weeks, and it's not just because I'm partial to the country, but because the soap and scents are just that awesome. If anyone is curious, make the jump. I feel most would be very pleased by the complex scents and stellar performance.\n\nEdit: a word.",

This is masterfully blended with notes of: Cedar Atlas, Dried Apricot, Black Plum, Texas Cedarwood, Rosewood, Mahogany, Tobacco, Teak, Leather, Sandalwood, Civet, Hyrax, Patchouli, Animal Musk. This fragrance shows off APR’s mastery of perfuming. The scent opens to my nose with a creamy sandalwood top before dark smokey cedar rolls into dominate this accord. Hints of leather and tobacco aid the journey into the cedar forest. A redditor, /u/ashbeofwulf, summed this fragrance up nicely, “Torchwood does for cedar, what Santal Auster did for sandalwood”. This shows the complexities a single note can exhibit with the right supporting cast. Unfortunately for me, this scent is a no go with Mrs. Ruds, despite my affection for it. Strength of scent is mid to strong once lathered and right off the soap. Similar scents from wet shaving are: Talbot Shaving River Rouge and Phoenix & Beau Spitfire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAPR’s soap base features the addition of lots of skin food.

A Muji store recently opened up next to my house and I was browsing there yesterday and came across their line of facial oils. They have rosehip oil, squalene oil, sweet almond oil and many others. I want to add a facial oil to my routine to combat my tret face flakiness. But when I searched the sub there doesn’t seem to be any posts about it. Has anyone tried them? Are they comparable to TO facial oils? I’m so tempted to buy them because of the convenience as opposed to ordering the TO facial oils and waiting for it to get delivered xD ",

Below is the text taken from their IG:\n\n**We are making some wonderful changes to our offerings. I pay close attention to reviews and I've seen a trend of folks wanting the rollerballs to be punchier. So, let's do it! Our rollerballs will be changing from the current 10% EDT concentration to 20% EDP concentration.\n\nHowever, I really don't want to raise the price. It's incredibly important to me that my products be accessible.\n\nTo offset the cost, I will be removing our EDP spray perfume\n\noption as the rollerballs will now fill that space. As the perfume\n\nbottles themselves cost significantly more, it will save some money as I'll go through less of them.\n\nThe body mists and parfum options will be unchanged.**\n\nI also noticed their samples will now be little spray bottles. \n\nAnyone think they're going to try out any scents with this change?\n\nEdited for spelling correction and to add, per their website, items now are listed as :\n\n\n10ml perfume oil rollerball (approx. 20% fragrance) - black matte glass bottle with a metal rollerball, in a base of sweet almond oil\n\n2 ounce body mist (approx. 3% fragrance) - black plastic bottle with a spray nozzle, in an alcohol base\n\n15ml parfum spray (approx. 40% fragrance) - in a frosted glass bottle with black spray nozzle, in an alcohol base (for international customers, your parfum will be made in a sweet almond oil base as alcohol is prohibited from air transit",

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nI've included several shots from multiple angles so you can really see how frizzy my hair is.\nI'm not sure how to identify if all of this is split ends, flyaways, frizz, or what the difference even truly is. \n\nRight now I regularly dust my hair starting as high towards my scalp as possible, and trim the ends ~every 12 weeks. \n\nI don't usually heat style, but when I do it's on a low setting with an electric brush, or hair dryer – maybe twice a month. (I have a 3 year old or else I'd probably do this daily.)\n\nRight now I use either Suave or ogx moisturizing coconut shampoo (in either brand) and condition with tresemme botanique coconut milk conditioner. \nOnce a week I use suave daily clarifying shampoo (*it helps manage my dry scalp), and before each shower I oil my scalp and length with either coconut or sweet almond oil. \n\nWhen I get out of the shower I plop with a muslin towel, then use Garnier leave-in conditioner as well as Garnier 10-in-1 keratin spray. (Note: I just started using this keratin spray to see if it would make any difference. So far none, but it has a heat protectant in it which I prefer over adding another hair oil)\n\n~3x/wk I use tresseme extra firm control mousse, as I did in the pictures included. \nOnce totally dry, I usually add more sweet almond oil to the ends, which I did not in these pictures. \n\nI have tried wax spray, and usually just gel my flyaways with Cantu twist and lock gel for updos, but I'm hoping for a smoother finish all the time. \n\nI want to invest in a japanese-style flyaway wax stick, and a new hair mask.\n\n(I have tried CGM and many wavy-specific routines / product guidelines, and I just don't find myself enjoying that after years of trying while growing out my length)\n\nRecommendations?",

    "body": "Hey guys. This forum has helped me quite a bit in dealing with my previously dry/dull skin and recently acne-prone combo skin. I want to give back with some things that are working for me. As obvious as these might be, I hope they help at least one another person. \n\n**Backstory:**\n\nUntil last year, my skin was a bit dry and dull, but otherwise fine. I didn't have a skincare routine aside from moisturizing and wearing sunscreen. Stress + hormones (I'm in my mid 20s) + bad diet + skin becoming oily = breakouts everywhere. I never had acne-prone skin until now. I kept breaking out, and couldn't figure out why it was happening because nothing seemed to trigger it and I didn't make any changes in my life at that time. Then I realized that my ways were just catching up with me, and some people break out in their mid 20s because of hormones.\n\n**My Routine:**\n\nAM\n\n* Cerave Hydrating Cleanser\n* Benton Snail Bee Essence\n* Caudalie Vinosource Sorbet (it's light and hypoallergenic, but pricey so I'll be replacing it when it's done)\n* Ole Henriksen Total Truth Eye Cream (a staple for me)\n* La Roche Posay Anthelios 60 SPF Sunscreen (a staple for me)\n\nPM\n\n* Sweet almond oil to remove eye make up (a staple and the best makeup remover I've ever had)\n* Banila Clean it Zero\n* Cerave Hydrating Cleanser\n* Actives (I alternate between La Roche Posay Derm AHA, Paula's Choice BHA, Neostrata Vitamin C, with off days)\n* Caudalie Vinosource Sorbet\n* Laneige water sleeping mask twice a week\n \n**Also...**\n\n* I spot treat with Biacna\n* I take Omega 3 capsules every day\n\n**What has helped:**\n\n* Sticking to a routine\n* **Waiting 30 mins after applying actives before applying moisturizer.** Holy moly has this helped. I only found out about this (through this forum!) recently. I thought Paula's Choice BHA was overhyped and that my Derm AHA wasn't working anymore because I applied moisturizer after it dried without giving it time to do its job. \n* Sleeping on my back to prevent breakouts and my lotions and potions from rubbing off\n* Cutting out dairy. I figured my crappy diet was exacerbating my skin's condition, so I decided to cut things out one by one so I could figure out what was doing it. I chose dairy 5 days ago, and I'm already seeing an improvement. The other things I was considering cutting out were sugar and caffeine. \n\n\nOther than these changes, I've been trying to keep things low-stress and get enough sleep. It can be due to one or a few of them, or it can be all, but this is what is working for me. I have a couple of blemishes that are on their way out, and then I'm going to start dealing with the scarring/texture. ",

    "body": "I apologise for the long read!!\n\nAbout me:\n\nSelf-Diagnosed Stage 1 Lipedema since puberty, in lower body and arms. My torso looks like it belongs to a different person. My arms and lower body belong to a different person. I have the classic signs, lumpy, scaly skinned, easily bruised legs. I have a tough lump (not very \"hard\", but definitely not squishy) above my knee that doesn't budge. I have spider veins on my thigh. I also have venous insufficiency, it recently got aggravated after overseas travel. My cankles show up when I sit/stand for long durations, rest of the times they are non-existent. Previously, I was between stage 2 and 3 when I was drinking alcohol frequently.\n\nWhat worked for me/and is working for me:\n\n1. WATER: I am the sociopath that  prefers to drink warm water all year. However, I drink room temperature water in summer so that I do not overheat, I avoid cold drinks/water at all costs. The idea here is to make the body burn the fat (like literally). Warm water does not reduce my internal temperature as compared to cooler drinks/water.\n2. FOOD: I have been vegan for 4 years, previously vegetarian for 31 years. Never eaten meat in my life, and never plan to do so. I am able to target 120-150grams of protein per day. Dairy caused me severe inflammation (adult acne), and I developed lactose intolerance which caused me to go vegan.\n3. EXERCISE: I work out 5 days a week, 2 active rest days/core training. I do strength training and cardio on 5 days. For cardio, I walk on inclined for 20-40 mins depending on the day of my cycle. Some days when I have more energy, I push myself to walk for 30-40mins after my strength training, but it's mostly 20-25mins daily average. I make sure I am reaching atleast 8-10k daily steps. I do not have access to a beach, walking barefoot on sand is really good. I walk on grass. I make sure I get sufficient sun. Happy to share my workout routine if anyone is interested.\n4. MISC: I use refrigerated sweet almond oil with my dry brush. I have noticed cellulite is less visible in my arms. It has reduced the appearance of strawberry pores in my legs, but I haven't notice any improvement in cellulite. I pour water with the coldest setting on my legs during bath (Hot water goes inside, cold water goes outside). I rarely drink alcohol, maybe once a year. I do not drink beer, only red wine if at all I have to drink. I try to remember to elevate my legs during resting, but I keep forgetting and need to work on that.\n5. SUPPLEMENTS: I take creatine and post-workout plant-protein shake. I get rest of my nutrients from my food. Happy to share my diet plan if anyone's interested.\n\nI was frequently bouncing from stage 1 to 2 and back, but I have remained stage 1 for a while, and my recent changes are giving me results. I will update if I remember anything else.",

    "body": "I got two - TWO - separate MLM pitches yesterday.\n\nThe first was at my job. I am a massage therapist at a spa. They like to think of themselves as clinical work but most everybody wants a 60 minute full body. I say this because when you work in a clinic you never expect a tip. When you work at a spa, tips are 30-50% of your income.\n\nDude came in and he was clutching a little plastic bag. When we got to the treatment room he pulls out some sweet almond oil and says he would like to use it for the session. I tell him it's against company policy. He seems bothered - \"Even though you're just using it on me?\" So I just repeat \"company policy.\" I don't know how I'll react to it, oil stains the sheets (we use cream) and almond is an allergen.\n\nWe do the massage, he seems to enjoy it (he fell asleep) and at the exit interview he seems happy. I noticed he doesn't have his little plastic bag so I tell him not to forget it. He tells me there's a [little gift for me](https://imgur.com/a/uGKNQ). \n\nI'm super pumped about the Burt's Bees. Don't really care about the Cetaphil wipes. Also the $5 (not pictured). But I've spent too much time on this subreddit apparently, so I googled \"Nature's bounty network marketing\" and the first thing that came up was a false advertising lawsuit against them on MLMlegal.com.\n\nI feel so bad for this guy. He's so desperate to make a sale that his annual massage - the one he can only afford because he gets it as a gift - was turned into a advertisement. That has to take so much out of it.\n\nFast forward to this morning and I'm checking my business's Facebook page and [I have a message](https://imgur.com/kUKSzNi)! Hooray! My name is getting around, my marketing is working. Soon I will be able to flee the spa! Someone is having an online education summit. I like learning. That sounds fun!\n\nSo I go to [her bio](https://imgur.com/gqkvCyY). \n\nThe thing that pisses me off about this? My practice is out of a birth center. She wants me to shill supplements and weight loss stuff to women who are either pregnant or about to give birth. She is intentionally attempting to capitalize on the fear and low self-confidence of my patients. Screw. Her.\n\nI felt bad about the dude having his massage ruined by pressure from his upline. But this woman can stick it where the sun don't shine.\n\nIf there's an update on the second one I'll post that too.\n\nETA:\n\nA friend just clarified something for me: Nature's Bounty is _not_ an MLM but their _marketing department_ is. Apparently they started out like Mary Kay but \"turned legit\" in his words.",

All of my hormone labs have been in normal range with my replacement therapy and I FEEL great! However, now that I finally have normal levels of estrogen, testosterone, DHEA and cortisol my skin has been freaking out.\n\nI had an appointment with a highly recommended dermatologist yesterday. I had a very thorough exam and we discussed my medical history and specific circumstances. She prescribed Tretinoin 0.025% Cream 45gm and said to start with 3 times a week.\n\nI've spent a lot of time doing my research (on this forum and other places) and I never jump into anything without being fully informed, but there are few things I would appreciate advice on as I add in the Tretinoin to my weekly routine. My time with my Dermatologist ran over, and I didnt get to ask these questions at my appointment.\n\nI've read it can be helpful to integrate a stronger retinol like Tretinoin by mixing it with a basic moisturizer. My skin can tolerate Cetaphil, so would that be a good one to integrate with the Tretinoin? If I go that route, how long do I do this before just applying the Tretinoin without mixing it with the Cetaphil?\n\nAlso, on the days that I’m not applying the Tretinoin is it okay for me to continue to use the Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Anti-Wrinkle Deep Wrinkle Night Facial Moisturizer or should I plan on just doing my argan oil moisturizer those evenings?",

So if your conditions make your skin sensitive on its own, I would take this super slow. \n\nI would start even more conservatively than 3 days a week. Some people experience a gnarly purge when starting Tret treatment - many suggest starting at 1x a week for a month, then increasing frequency once a month until you get to your desired frequency. Admittedly, however, doing it once a week makes it really hard to remember to incorporate it into your routine lol (I always forget...) I don’t think you need to buffer the Tret in a moisturizer if you start slow. \n\nAlso noticed your night time moisturizer has retinol in it. Not as strong as Tretinoin, but something you might consider removing or cutting back on while your skin gets used to Tret.",

    "body": "I make soaps and lotions as a hobby, and while I was perusing Ipsy Shopper today I saw this Obsidian Renewal Scrub. I know what most of these ingredients do in cosmetic formulations. I'll go over what I think this product will be like and then I'll break down the ingredients. \n\nMost notably this product does not have any water in it. It will probably be difficult to wash off without a cleanser. It also does not have any preservatives. This is usually not a big deal in products that aren't made with water, but it may cause issues if water gets in it while you're using it. This product has sugar in it, and the combination of water and sugar may cause fermentation. This is something that gives me pause. ESSENTIAL OILS ARE NOT PRESERVATIVES. \n\nDue to the activated charcoal, this product will probably be black or dark gray, which is the only explanation for the use of Obsidian in the name. The oils and the potassium hydroxide will react with each other to create soap. Although it looks like there is so much excess oil that the cleansing effects will be very mild and it will still leave the conditioning oils behind. Sugar appears to be the main exfoliant, and may be too rough for sensitive skin. \n\nMost of the oils are good and are ones I would use for making soaps and lotions. However, due to the potentially irritating essential oils, sugar, and lack of preservatives this is not something I would be interested in using.\n\n\nShea Butter - conditioning to the skin, maintains solidity at room temp\n\nSweet Almond Oil - conditioning to the skin, provides a small amount of lather, may affect people with nut allergies\n\nRaw Sugar - physical exfoliant. Biodegradable, inexpensive, effective. Usually better as a body exfoliator than for the face.\n\nCoconut Oil - conditioning to the skin but can be drying in high concentrations, maintains solidity at room temp, provides some lather\n\nOlive Fruit Oil - conditioning to the skin, fairly inexpensive\n\nJojoba Oil - a good ingredient for dry skin\n\nCoconut derived Activated Charcoal - absorbs oil, mild physical exfoliant, may create a black or gray color in the formulation. Can be drying if improperly balanced with conditioning oils.\n\nTea Tree - tea tree what? We don't know! If it's oil it may have antibacterial properties and provide conditioning. Liquid at room temperature.\n\nSlippery Elm - Not familiar with this one.\n\nTurmeric - *MAY* provide antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Topical efficacy and dosage still not conclusive.\n\nCajeput - aromatic essential oil similar to tea tree\n\nLavender - fragrance\n\nSweet Orange - possibly irritating fragrance\n\nBergamot - possibly irritating fragrance\n\nLemongrass - fragrance\n\nRosemary - fragrant essential oil that may have skin benefits\n\nPeppermint - will most likely cause a tingling sensation. Fragrance.\n\nPalm Kernel Oil - problematic ingredient. Palm oil/palm kernel oil/palm trees are contributing to deforestation and loss of orangutan and other animal habitats. Look for \"sustainability sourced\" or \"RSPO Certified\" on ingredient lists.\n\nPotassium Hydroxide - lye. Used to make liquid soap or to balance pH. A very basic/high pH ingredient. Makes soap when combined with oils.\n\nCitric Acid - used to balance pH. A very acidic/low pH ingredient\n\nTocopherol - fat soluble vitamin E\n\nRosemary CO2 Antioxidant.",

Mohammad, the proprietor and self proclaimed foodie and road cyclist, has continued to reformulate the soap base in order to provide the best possible wet shaving experience. In 2018, the brand received improved packaging and several variants of the popular vegan soap base, and animal fat soap base. In addition to purchasing direct from Grooming Dept, they can also be purchased from West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVeritas is a complex and masculine fragrance that consists of notes of: cocoa, tobacco, leather, cognac, castoreum, tonka bean, osmanthus and patchouli. The scent is rich with an opening of cocoa, tobacco, leather and cognac. The dry down displays the tonka and patchouli backbone that the scent is based on. I am not a huge fan of this scent, I find it fairly muddled and almost thrown together. As you’d expect based on the notes, this scent is also not approved for use by Mrs. Ruds. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the soap container and stays at this level through the entire shave. Scents that share similar vibes from wet shaving are:  Wholly Kaw Cuero Oscuro and Tallow + Steel Echoes of Rain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrooming Dept’s “lusso” formula is utilized for this soap. The base pays homage to italian style shaving soap bases and are tallow only according to the artisans formula page (https://www.groomingdept.com/pages/formulas). The ingredient list is as follows: Aloe Vera Juice, Cow Milk, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Oil, Beef Tallow, Cupuacu Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Pomegranate Oil, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Beta Sitosterol, Silk Amino Acids, Sunflower Lecithin, Sodium Lactate and Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E). The soap is soft on the firmness spectrum. It loads with little effort into your brush fibers regardless of type. This soap is very thirsty, among the thirstiest soaps I’ve used much like the previous review of both “primus tallow” formula and “janus tallow” formula. When dial in, the lather is a mid structure lather with the consistency of creme fraiche . Slickness stands with the elite class soap bases with regards to both primary and secondary slickness. The post shave also takes its place among the standout elites. Given the overall experience with this luxurious soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 96. Similar performing soaps are Declaration Icarus and Arianna & Evans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Grooming Dept Veritas (loaner)\n* Brush - Maseto Shaving 30mm 2 Band (purchased)\n* Razor - Corvette 1965 (gift)\n* Post - Ariana & Evans Signature (purchased)",

As a law enforcement officer in the Saint Louis area, the artisan is looking to make a great shaving product for consumers while also raising funds for families that have lost loved ones in the line of duty. First Line Shave will be donating a portion of all sales to the The Backstoppers Inc. ([https://backstoppers.org/](https://backstoppers.org/)). This organization raises  funds to benefit the families of fallen first responders in the St. Louis Mo area. First Line Shave’s first release is set for Friday, May 3, 2019 5PM CT and will include both soap and aftershave bundle.\n\nFirst Line Shave’s initial offering features notes of Mandarin, Lavender, Green Botanics, Jasmine, Basil, Geranium, Sage, Sandalwood, Vetiver, Rosewood and Amber. This smells sharp but clean and masculine and reminds me quite a bit of Calvin Klein’s Eternity fragrance. I would call this scent an aromatic fougere. I like this scent, it is a classic scent. This scent is also Mrs. Ruds approved as she enjoys CK Eternity. Strength of scent for this offering is mid-strong out of the container and remains that way through the entire shave. A scent with similarities in wet shaving are: Stubble Buster Burnish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst Line Shave is a tallow based soap featuring the following ingredients: Beef Tallow, Aqua, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Jojoba Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Kokum Butter, Murumuru Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Cupuacu Butter, Cocoa Butter, Fragrance Oil, Kaolin Clay,Tussah Silk. The soap is of mid firmness and I experienced no issues loading the brush. The soap is thirstier than most, but not the thirstiest I’ve used. When properly dialed in the lather resemble greek yogurt, displaying good density and a mid level sheen. The slickness in terms of primary is excellent, residual fall back a step to very good. Post shave is excellent as well. My skin felt soft and well hydrated after a complete rinse. Given my experience to date and the metrics mentioned, the ShaveScore for First Line Shave’s soap base is a 91. For similar performance in soap bases I’d recommend: CBL Soaps or Oleo Soapworks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - First Line Shave (promotional gift)\n* Brush - ​Blackship Grooming Custom TSM (purchased)\n* Razor - Boker “Elite” (gift)\n* Post - Aqua Velva Iced Sport (purchased)",

AP Reserve is known for their bold and masterful fragrances and for their collaborative efforts with other notable artisans across the globe. Australian Private Reserve can be sourced directly from their website and also at: Maggard Razors (www.maggardrazors.com), West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)) and Beard & Blade Supply Co. ([https://www.beardandblade.com.au/](https://www.beardandblade.com.au/)).\n\nRaconteur is designed as a cooler weather fragrance. In typical AP Reserve fashion, the scent is designed from the ground up and pushes the boundaries of master fragrancing. The fragrance features notes of; Roast Arabica Coffee, Whisky, Tuberose, Cedarwood, Spice, Labdanum, Leather, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Guaiac Wood, Castoreum, Civet and Animal Musk. The resulting fragrance is bold, rich and masculine. Mrs. Ruds loves this scent. She finds it ideal for date night or casual use and anywhere in between. This scent is on my short list as a candidate for “scent of the year 2019”. Strength of scent is strong out of the container and remains this way for the entire shave. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Barrister and Mann Leviathan as a similar scent profile. \n\nAP Reserve’s soap base features an ingredients list that reads as: Stearic Acid, Aqua, Glycerin, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Allantoin, Citric Acid, Silk Protein. The soap is fairly firm and loading it is easy regardless of what fiber brush you choose. The soap is thirsty, but not in a cumbersome way. The lather is dense, similar to cold sour cream with a vibrant sheen. The slickness is excellent both primary and residual. The post shave is also excellent, as it leaves the skin as soft and supple as you could ask for. The AP Reserve soap base comes in with a ShaveScore of 94. Soaps with a ShaveScore and experience similar to this are Noble Otter and Tallow + Steel.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Australian Private Reserve Raconteur (purchased)\n* Brush - Dogwood Handcrafts Milkglass (purchased)\n* Razor - Blackland Vector (promotional gift)\n* Post - Australian Private Reserve Raconteur (purchased)",

    "body": "Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil is one of the most selling hair oil in the Indian Market. Why not, because it is made from almond oil which is beneficial for better immunity, a sharper brain, and healthy hair. But do this product, really has what it claims? What are the Ingredients? Is it worth using? Let’s find out.\n\nIngredient List of Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* LLP – 76.8% \n* Mustard Oil including Sweet Almond Oil – 21% \n* Perfume \n* Vit. E Acetate \n* TBHQ \n* CL 4700, CL 26100\n\n1. What is LLP? \n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_paraffin_(drug)#Health), LLP stands for Light liquid paraffin. It is a by-product of the petroleum industry and can contain cancer-causing hydrocarbons. This product has 76% of LLP. The reason is just to make it non-sticky. We understand that people don’t like sticky hairs, but this is absurd. Adding paraffin oil in a higher percentage can never add value to your hair.\n\n2. Sweet Almond Oil -\n\nIf you a look at the ingredients carefully, you will find that Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil has Sweet Almond Oil mixed with Mustard Oil. And, the overall percentage of Mustard Oil including Sweet Almond Oil is just 21%. That means, **Its main ingredient sweet almond oil is even less than 21%.** *Isn’t it a funny thing?* \n\n3. Perfume and Colors -\n\nThe brand has added perfume and two colors – CL 4700, CL 26100.  \n\nAs per the data of [MadeSafe,](https://www.madesafe.org/hazard-list-3/)  Perfume is used as an umbrella term for dozens of different ingredients that make up a particular scent. Many common fragrance ingredients, like phthalates and synthetic musks, are toxic to human health.  \n\nAs per the data of [MadeSafe](https://www.madesafe.org/hazard-list-3/),  Artificial colors can be derived from coal tar, but are more commonly made from petroleum. A number of artificial colors, individually and in combination, have been associated with increased hyperactivity in children, including those with pre-existing hyperactivity and without. \n\n4. TBHQ -  TBHQ is another common additive in hair oils. TBHQ stands for ‘Tertiary Butylhydroquinone’. It is mainly a Harsh Preservative used in Mineral Oils and Paraffin Oils. \n\n5. Vit. E Acetate – The only safe ingredient - Vit. E Acetate is also known as Tocopheryl Acetate is a safe ingredient and a great antioxidant. It helps in conditioning the skin. It is the only good thing about this product. Source - Biodizionario \n\nIs it Good & Safe to Use? The Conclusion –\n\nAlmond oil is naturally heavy in nature and as people love non-sticky hair oils, they have added LLP as a solution. It also contains potentially harmful preservatives, colors, and perfume.\n\nNow its your choice to choose whether the value for money products or continue using such products",

    "body": "Okay so I’m a Circle member and I just received my samples for the spring collection! Here’s my impressions right out of the bottle. I may update once I wear them and let them settle. \n\n**ACONITUM: Wolfsbane, tangled roots, wildflower field, metal, storm, rock, black fur, wild musk**\nOoo okay, this is sharp. This is what I wanted Lycanthrope to smell like. It’s very wild but very green. It’s a very clean scent but not soapy, just very bright and sharp, if that makes sense? This is the first rock/stone scent from S92 that doesn’t smell soft and dusty to me. It’s strong, surprising scent. There’s something peppery and I’m not sure what. The only thing that I’m not smelling at all is the wildflowers. \n\n**ATROPA BELLADONNA: Nightshade berry, narcotic flowers, green tomato, green pepper, soil, broomstick, velvet plum**\nSo this was the one I was most excited to try. The tomato and pepper and soil sounded right up my alley, especially because I love S92’s eternal return which is all vegetables and greenery and dirt. But I was disappointed! I didn’t get any of those sharp bright greens! I got much more of that in ACONITUM. It’s not a bad smell but it wasn’t particularly unique. Something about it smells stale, I think perhaps the plum? It’s the only thing that seems out of place.\n\n**CONIUM MACULATUM: Hemlock flower, citrus blossom, coumarin, lavender spike, tobacco leaf, castoreum, oak, bergamot, dried iris (premium)**\nInteresting! First impression is that is smells sort of like good earl grey tea. I can pick up the coumarin, lavender, and iris but not much else. It kind of smells like a hotel lobby for some reason. I’m not particularly excited to wear it but we’ll see. \n\n**DATURA METEL: Datura blossom, sweet almond, rose water, sugar cube, vanilla orchid, moth wing, wild honeycomb**\nThis smells like straight sweet almond oil and that’s about it. There’s a hint of the datura blossom at the end, but overwhelmingly this is a cloyingly sweet almond scent. I tend to find all of S92’s almond scents overwhelming like this, so I’m not surprised. But still disappointed. I’m curious about what the moth wing is supposed to smell like. \n\n**NERIUM OLEANDER: White and pink oleander, heliotrope, apple seed, sweet custard, pineapple, thyme, coconut water**\nWow this is sweet. Syrupy sweetness with a little pineapple. I wish I was getting some of these florals and the thyme but I get nothing except sugary, cloying gourmand. \n\n\nSo as of now, my favorite was ACONITUM for sure. Least favorite is a tie for DATURA METEL and NERIUM OLEANDER. They were just too one-note and gourmand for me! \n\nThis was my first review post so sorry it was so short! I’d love to hear everyone else’s thoughts and I’ll try to update once I let them rest a little longer! ",

It's almost like stepping out of Lycanthrope's forest and into a field bursting with new growth, with a storm brewing in the distance. They both have that musky fur undertone and those stone/rock notes. \n\nYes, that almond note in Datura Metel ruins the blend for me. Oddly enough, the only S92 with almond that I enjoy is Wicked, which I've seen a few people say smells like straight up almond extract. \n\nThank you for the reviews!",

    "body": "[40 Crows](https://imgur.com/UsIusz0) is the new Fall scent From Oz Shaving Co and comes in their new Emerald Base. Base ingredients comparison is as follows: \n\nOld- Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Water, Glycerine, Coconut Milk, Potassium Hydroxide, Palm Kernel Flakes, Sodium Hydroxide, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Castor Oil, Shea Butter, Myristyl Myristate, Safflower Oil, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tussah Silk.\n\nNew- Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Water, Glycerine, Coconut Milk, Aloe Juice, Potassium Hydroxide, Babassu Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Castor Oil, Shea Butter, Myristyl Myristate, Sweet Almond Oil, Hemp Seed Oil, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Tussah Silk.\n\nI wanted to shave with this new soap 3 times so that I could fully enjoy this soap and absorb what it has to offer. To me, loading this base into the brush is a bit different. Just to preface, I face lather. I didnt try to bowl lather, because I just went with whats natural to me. Back to loading, this soap is a bit softer than the other two Oz Soaps that I have which are in the old base. And when I say a bit, I mean a little bit. You can still load it like you hate it and youll be fine, but anything over 10 seconds is possibly overkill.\n\nThe lathering process was the same. To me, it takes a good bit of water. What I like to do is get the lather all sticky when I first put it on my face and then add water as I go via making a divot in the brush and putting water in the brush. Essentially, I turn my brush into a cup and apply the water directly to my face. I normally do this twice before the first pass, and once when I relather for the second pass and it works out perfect.\n\nWhen lathered properly, the soap makes copious amounts of thick, rich, dense, shiny lather, and in comparison to the old base, it is a tad bit congealed? Stringy? I think those are the words im looking for. The Xanthan Gum is noticeable.\n\nOnto the scent. For me, the scent is a winner. Hands down, hands up, left or right. When I did the review for JPH some time ago, I remember saying that the scent strength wasnt that strong. That has been remedied, and it is a strong scent.  The Dried leaves is what I pick up in the most because its a reminiscent scent. I remember raking leaves in the Fall growing up, so it sticks with me. I can pick out the Rose and Lemon as well.\n\nThe Scent Profile is as follows:\n\nA deep dark base of Oakmoss and Amber, with a small hint of Patchouli.  The mid notes contain Neroli, rose and dried leaves and the top notes blend bergamot with lemon.\n\nWhen its all said and done, to me, this soap is a Winner. From the art, to the base, to the scent, to the post shave...its a Winner.\n\nThese thoughts are mine and mine alone, as I bought the Soap and AS Splash. Take care y'all.",

    "body": "I know aromatherapy and essential oils are becoming more popular, and you are finding them for sale a lot more readily available. I thought I'd give some information to everyone on how to properly buy or identify a good grade essential oil. I've supplied a lot of information =] hope some of it makes some sense.\n\nI have this similar post, not as detailed in some other subreddits, but someone suggested I post it again here, so here it is! With more to wrap your brain around.\n\nJust for the record, I am not a certified aromatherapist. The course is ridiculously expensive.. maybe one day. But I am a firm believer in the use of essential oils as well as herbalism. If anyone has any questions on either, I can try my best to help answer with what I know. Or if someone else here is certified aromatherapist or herbalist it would be great to hear from you :) I have many questions!\n\nI am supplying the information I received from some aromatherapy courses, as well as some of my own research since then. So please, do not hold any of my methods, blends ideas accountable for anything. Everything is at your own risk. You should always consult a certified aromatherapist if you are looking to use EO for medicinal use. They can be very dangerous if you don't know the specificity for each oil. There are some oils that cannot be used with pregnant ladies, certain diseases/conditions. Skin sensitivities can be a hazard as well.\n\nIf you are planning to use essential oils on your own, just remember **Always use smaller concentrations with animals and children! Always dilute your oils, unless specified by a certified aromatherapist**\n\nFirst I want to start by saying, I live in Canada.. so we are a part of the Canadian Federation of Aromatherapy (CFA)\n\nThere are many factors that can determine whether or not you are getting legit good grade essential oils. Once you read through this post, it should be clear as to why some oils can be so expensive. Fun fact: It takes about 60000 roses to produce just 1 ounce of rose oil :)\n\n**3 models of aromatherapy** \n\n**-** German emphasizes inhalation of EO\n\n**-** British is very conservative, support high level dilution, no emphasis on therapeutic grade oils\n\n**-** French proactive and support NEAT (direct skin use). Rely strongly on scientific studies, emphasizes therapeutic uses.\n\n**3 Factors to grow the best crop** – Take into consideration for purchasing essential oils (EO)\n\n**-** grown with no pollution.\n\n**-** Harvested properly. Only oil pockets should be harvested not the whole plant.\n\n**-** Harvested when yield is highest.\n\n**Facts about Essential oils you may not know:**\n\n - A bottle of EO only needs 3-5% of actually essential oil to be labeled 'pure' which is why its important to research the brands quality.\n\nOil pockets are specific to each plant they are found in. A plant grown one place will be different to another.\n\n** Extraction methods**\n\nCO2 extracted – not for medicinal use\n\nSteam extracted – is the best. You should only purchase and use this.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAllergic reactions to scents usually come from synthesized material used in place of oil. \n\nAll plants have their own antidotes, there’s no allergens to pure oil. \n\nSandalwood tree grows 50 years before it can be harvested. Forest fires have limited the production of this EO.\n\n*It's always nice to incorporate a drop of a persons 'essence' into their blend. Eg; a showy person, likes attention – they may like cinnamon. A down to earth person – Thyme.*\n\n\n****Quality control***\n\n*What to look for and ask to see when buying oils. If the seller doesn’t have the information, or isn't sure what you mean...* **DO NOT BUY!**\n\n**Botanical name** – normally on the front of the bottle ie. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) Always *Always* Make sure to check the botanical name, there are sometimes mulitple types of one plant and they can be VERY different, for instance, the regular lavendar you know is called lavendar officinalis, but there is also a Lavendar lespica.. it smells different and is used for a stimulant (complete opposites!)\n\n**Geographical location** – where the plant was harvested from\n\n**Plant harvest** – Wild is best. It has natural fighting instincts, making its biochemical make up stronger. \n\n**Stage of development** – if the plant was at its highest peak when harvested\n\n**Distilled organ** – not usually worried about in North America\n\n**Mode of extraction** – You always want steam distilled\n\n**Biochemical specificity** - Designation of biochemical specificity is critical in knowing what unique characteristics are available for therapeutic uses and specific purposes. For example, there are several forms of essential oil of Thyme, each having its own therapeutic benefits and uses. Knowing the distinctions can keep you and your family safe, and benefiting from the wisdom of the ages. [site explaining gas chromatography and steam distillation](http://www.frre.utn.edu.ar/quimobi/clean/files/get/item/1870)\n \n\nThis may seem tricky to begin with, but look these things up online and you will learn better, or take a weekend aromatherapy course :)\n\n**Modes of use**\n\n*topical* – most common\nfor Massage, compresses, hand/foot bath, regular bath. If you are using oils in a path, place your salts/oils/oats ect in cheesecloth to hold everything together. \n\n    Always dilute with skin sensitivities.\n\n    Don't use petroleum based oils, mineral oils, or baby oil they decrease the absorption on skin.\n\n    Essential oils don't mix well with water, they need a medium. Vodka or witch hazel work good, as does any sort of oil – olive, apricot, sweet almond ect.\n\n    Always mix your oils in glass, it can eat through plastic. Once it is mixed with a medium it is alright for plastic containers.\n\n**Aerosols** – affect the limbic system\n**Always use a GLASS diffuser**\n\n    Oil goes through the glass and adamises through the air.\n\n    Heating oils – heat kills the biochems therefore leaving no therapeutic effect, but smells nice\n\n    using pads – all the biochemicals evaporate, leaving only a nice scent.\n\n    Plastic – oils eat through plastic. Not a good idea\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, diluted EO's don't eat plastic, so blends in blastic are ok!\n\n**Cooking** – helps increase flavour, add it right before serving, don't cook the EO. And you only need a drop or two in each personal serving. A little goes a long way.\n\n    Try these – 1 drop of basil on a bowl of chili\n\n    mix 1 drop of ginger in with sugar for sprinkling on gingersnaps\n    \n    peppermint EO in icing for cakes, cookies ect.\n    \n    Peppermint or sweet orange in a cup of hot chocolate. \n\n**Gardening**  \n\nYou can line a garden bed (or plant pots) with a string soaked in a diluted citrus essential oil. \nI don't have much experience with this area, but certain EO's can keep birds away from berries, pests away from trees.. :) you can also use certain EO's on pets to keep ticks away, thyme is one of them! \n\n\n    A nice carpet cleaner/pwder I use before vaccuming – 1 cup of baking soda, 20 drops total of (top)sweet orange, (mid)bergamot, (base) eucalyptus. Sprinkle it all around and let it sit for up to an hour, its safe to walk on I sometimes move it around with my feet. Then vacuum it up! Sometimes I sprinkle EO into my vacuum bag too for a nice scent. \n\n    Floor washing – 1/2c vinegar, with a mixture of orange, grapefruit, eucalyptus\n\n\n*Fragrance notes are based on volatility and viscosity.* This is what gives you Top Mid and Base notes. Lighter oils are top notes meaning they will disappear quicker you add moire of this, where base notes stay and linger, you need less of this one. [site with good information on fragrance notes and much more](http://www.essentialoils.co.za/fragrance-notes.htm#Holistic%20and%20alternative%20medicine)\n\nTop notes: evaporate quickest, increase the # of drops, most stimulating\n\nMid notes: Balancer, increase concentration\n\nBase notes: Smell last, is strongest, dont use a lot, sedative/fixative in the blend.\n\n    A good ratio to use Top4 Mid3 Base1, and apply that to your carrier\n    More ratios If you're wanting something from an acute problem use 10 drops, ratio 1 top 2 mid.\n*Chronic: 7 drops total 2 mid 1 base*\n*Synergistic: 8 drops 1 top 1 mid*\n\n**Here is a Blending guide:**\n\nFor **normal dilution - which is 2.5%**\n\nx amount of carrier oil - divide by 2 = drops of essential oil\nfor example: 20ml carrier oil / 2 = 10 drops.\n\nExample of a 2.5% blend - 5 sandalwood, 3 lavendar, 2 orange in 20ml apricot kernel oil.\n\n**Low dilution 1% for sensitive skin and pregnancy** (always check with a certified aromatherapist or someone of alternative medicine before using when pregnant, for children or babies)\n\nX amount carrier oil in ml - divide by 4 = essential oil drops\n\n**Extremely low dilution, sensitive skin, children, babies**\n1 drop : 10 ml Or use sweet almond oil by itself.\n\n**Some nice blends:**\n\nClary sage + ylangylang – calming\n\nLemon grass – 10 drops in a hotel(or house) tub to help \ncleans air, make it really hot so the room steams up.\n\nGrapefruit – brings joy helps with releasing grief\n\nThyme – gets rid of ticks\n\nLemon – cleansing. Good to diffuse in the air when cleaning, or use in household cleansers\n\nBasil + lavender – helps with insomnia\n\ngeranium – increases ambiance, brings conversation to a party when diffused in air.\n\nClarysage – helps with painful periods, dysmenorrhea\n\nThyme, lineol, honey – good for coughs\n\nnettle herb and rosemary – gives hair a nice effect\n\nwintergreen, lemongrass – good for arthritis relief\n\npatchouli – great for skin in general\n\nvitivere + grapefruit – I just really like this one lol\n\ncitronella, peppermint, lemongrass – repel bugs/ants\n\n\nconsiderations when blending: [Carrier oil info and shelf lives](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html)\n\n**oil chemistry:** volatility, viscolsity and properties.\n\nDesired therapeutic action – blending correctly allows synergistic affect in the blend (action of oils increase by mixing together)\n\nsequence of blend – changing the sequence of blending can chance the bichem properties and smell\n\nBase oils: It's nice to use a mixture of different base oils here's some general information about some different oils, this info is easy to find anywhere on the internet though.\n\n    *All purpose oils – used for cosmetics, massage, fragrant baths. Oils listed below:*\n\nApricot kernel – high mineral and vitamins, natural moisturizer. Light texture, increases penetrative qualities.\n\nSunflower – Fine. Good for massage blends, high in vitamin E\n\nSweet almond – Soothing, softening properites. Good for babies.\n\nGrapeseed – Good for oily skin.\n\n    *Special carrier oils: help increase skin penetration, nourish dry dehydrated skin, increase a lifespan of oil blends.* \n\nCarrot oil – lots of vitamins, A especailly.. helps with tanning careful it can stain.\n\nSesame – 85% unsaturated 15% saturated fat. Used as additive to enrich other oils.\n\nAvocado – lots of vit A, B, lecithin, protiens, fats, gives soft skin, absorbs easy.\n\nJojoba – long shelf life, thicken reams, resembles skins natural sebum. Suitable for face.\n\nWheatgerm – rich and viscous. Strong smell. Use 10-20% ratio to other oils to prevent rancidity.\n\n\n**Chemistry** [site reference](http://www.experience-essential-oils.com/chemistry-of-essential-oil.html)\n\nThis may be a bit in depth. But its useful information if you wanna get more serious about your oils!\n\nTherapeutic oil has no propylene glycol or petrochemicals\n\nmain groups of compounds in EO's are hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds which are further divided...\n\n*monoterpenes:* – inhibit accumulation of toxins, detox kidneys, liver. Enhance therapeutic values of other compounds, balancing.\n\n*High in monoterpenes: Grapefruit, orange, baloomfir*\n\n*Phenolics* – stimulate the nervous system and immune system. Clean receptor sites for cells so faulty information can be deleted from the cell. Antioxidants, increase oxygenating molecules, anti-infectious, anti-bacterial, antiseptic\n\n*High in phenolic – wintergreen, clove, teatree*\n\n*Alcohols* – increase resistance to oxidation. Ability to revert cells to their normal function, anti infectious/viral/bacteraial.\n\n*high in alcohols: rosewood, geranium, rose otto*\n\n*Esters* – reaction of alcohol and acid. Most relaxing, calming, balancing. Regulate the nervous sytem. Anti-fungal decrease inflamation and spasm.\n\n*High in esters: bergamot, valerian, roman chammomile*\n\n* Aldehydes* – Delightful fragrances. Antiviral, inflammation, calms nervous system, helps decrease blood pressure, relieves stress.\n\n*High in aldehydes: cinnamon bark, lemon grass*\n\n*Ketones* – Not as prevalent as monoterpenes and alcohol. Distinctive fragrance. Calming, sedative. Stimulates cell regeneration, increases cell growth and liquivies mucous.\n\n*High in ketones: western red cedar, rosemary, idaho tansy*\n\n*Oxides* – derived from compounds such as alcohol, terpenes, or ketones which have been oxidized. \n\n*High in oxides – Ravensara, eucaluptus*\n\n    other compounds 20% or less: Alkalines, etheres, carboxylic, acids, lactines, coumarins, furanoids.\n\nMost of these sub-groups can be broke down into specific compounds from there you can really see a total chemical profile of an EO.\n\n    ie. grapefruit profile\n    90-95% monoterpenes, 3-8% tetraterpenes, 1-3% aldehydes, >3% furanocoumarines, sesquiterpenones, alochols, thiols. Aka detoxifeir, antiseptic, antiviral due to increased monoterpenes.\n\nThanks for reading, hope this was of some interest and help. Sorry about my typos or grammatical errors, I feel too lazy to go and change them :p\n\nIf anyone has anything else to add to this, please do! \n\n[good site](http://aromaticwisdominstitute.com/are-your-essential-oils-gcms-tested)",

Just because they are 'natural' doesn't mean they are to be used blindly, they are powerful and need to be understood to be used correctly.\n\nI have a couple of extremely minor, mostly anecdotal things to add to that lovely wealth of info...\n\nI myself recently suggested using a spray bottle of water with a few drops of eo to freshen a room - I should have mentioned adding a tiny amount of soap to the water as it acts as a dispersant. Also, always give that bottle a quick shake before spritzing!\n\nI discovered completely by accident that a drop of spearmint oil in a vanilla shake makes a damn fine replica of a McDonald's shamrock shake.

    "body": "I am actually in the process of building a makeup and skincare collection, but I'm trying to do so slowly and mindfully. I started this last summer/fall completely from scratch, for my old makeup collection got lost due to various life circumstances. Beginning, I had homemade chapstick bricks, aloe vera gel, homemade oat/milk scrub, sweet almond oil. I also had half a pack of makeup wipes but no makeup, half a tube of spf moisturizer, and some brushes I got from a woman who had other brushes she liked better.\n\nFirst, I tried drugstore makeup, but everything I bought I had to throw out because it wasn't the right color on me or its formula was absolute crap. I might as well flush money down the toilet. These experiences plus the experiences of drugstore makeup from my old makeup collection convinced me to swear off drugstore makeup items- I will not go into a drugstore and buy makeup. I have gotten some hate on reddit for having this personal rule- maybe it makes me a snob or something?- but it's how I save money in the long run. I don't want a big collection; I want a collection of things that I use regularly and enjoy using. To avoid wasting more and more money, I am instead researching the crap out of any product or product type that interests me. The companies that give out samples are generally the mid-range companies, so that's what my collection centers around. (In addition to the homemade stuff listed above!)\n\nI started out with some tiny eyeshadow samples and a TF Natural Love Palette. I have oily eyelids, so then I researched and tried some eye primers. I bought DS of them until I found one that I liked both the formula and the packaging/application style of. I learned that doefoot applicators are wasteful and squeeze tubes are much more to my tastes. \n\nI got several more DS/travel size makeup items to play with and learn my tastes with. This part is super fun and exciting because it's NEW STUFF! and new stuff is always full of possibilities. Then, comes the overwhelmed part: \"You mean I have to try this one, too? But I'm trying the other one!\" It can feel a little overwhelming, and then frustrating because I will ALWAYS, without fail, pick a favorite, but if the other little sample is not horrid, I still want to use it up. Then, I'm a little grumpy because I'm using up this one sample while thinking \"gotta use THIS one up so that I can use the BETTER one. Why can't I just use the better one? Why didn't I psychically know that the other one was better from the beginning?\" but that is okay because it's really all part of the process. Using up all of the samples can be a little tedious, but it's far better than buying a FS and hoping/praying it's a good one, and I live in the middle of nowhere, so I can't go and test out anything.\n\nI've gotten my makeup to the point where I don't need much more added to it. I purchased my summer foundation using my Beauty Insider discount. I'd like another of my favorite lip balm to last me through the year, but it's no rush, really. I no longer do my makeup and have to stop and wish I had a foundation or some other vital step, so I've drastically slowed down my makeup research and buying.\n\nWhile getting back into makeup, I discovered that using makeup leads to needing a better skincare because the makeup wipes dehydrated my skin and the makeup accentuated the not-taken-care-ness of my face in general. I've had a stressful few years, and I felt I looked 7 years older than I am! Clearly, I needed skincare. So again I started my research phase, figured out what I was interested in, looked at what products were available and researched the ones that I was interested in within that category, then got a couple samples.\n\nI have been going through the cycle of patch testing and trying out a sample, recording my thoughts on it, then trying another. Of course, when you buy a sample of a product, people love to throw in...what else? MORE SAMPLES! so I wound up with a lot more things to try than I had originally planned for. No matter! I'll try many of them anyways. (Within reason. I have very sensitive skin and some serious issues with certain fragrances. Things that were a solid \"no\" upon opening/testing them were tossed, and things I knew I couldn't use from the start have been put in their own baggie to be given to someone else.) It may be slightly overwhelming at times, but I've learned a lot! Personally, I can't stand Lancome's formulas. I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't gotten several extra samples from them, and they would have remained this mysterious fancy brand that gets put in magazines and I might have been tempted to buy their stuff later. This way, I learned that their stuff feels slimy without any extra cost. I also found some good products/brands of things that I will keep in mind for using in the future. It's all recorded on a spreadsheet.\n\nAt this point in my skincare testing, I have my known-for-sure favorites and winners of most product category show-downs. I've got an AM moisturizer, some finalists for PM, a serum, and I'll be testing out some SPF and cleansers but I know what I'm looking for at this point so it shouldn't be difficult. I think that trying out samples various products has really helped lessen the mysterious, magical shiny-ness of many brands and products for me. (though it has truly solidified it for a few!) I can look at fancy brand x and think, \"Oh, I tried their product y. It was okay, I guess, but brand z has something similar and I like it much better.\"\n\nI am also at the point where I feel okay not using up the last few unopened, less-than-interesting samples I got. Some are duplicates I managed to get accidentally and some are things that I'm pretty sure I have chosen my product for already, and most are just not necessary in my life. It feels wasteful to not use them, but then again, they are only foils and I'm putting them in a baggie to give to someone else. I can always raid the baggie if I feel like I actually do want to use one of the foils right that moment.\n\nToday, I used up several things. I know that this subreddit is all about getting use out of things until they are all used up, so here's the list:\n\nToday I finished using up a small bottle of emu oil I re-purposed as a makeup remover because the piercing that I was healing it with stopped needing it a while ago. I had also been using it on a few random scars, but honestly it didn't do that much for them. I am glad to have used it all because this particular oil has a short expiration date which it probably already passed.\n\nI hit pan on my most-used shade of my EL sample quad today! The shade is suuuuuper tiny so it didn't take very long with regular use. It's exciting because it represents just how many times I have applied/practiced applying makeup recently. I'm super excited to use it up and replace its space in my little magnetic palette with m favorite shade, very similar to the one I hit pan on. I've noticed quite a learning curve from deciding to pan this shade until now.\n\nI am about 1/2 to 2/3 way through my least favorite (but still acceptable and good and doesn't break me out) .5oz PM moisturizer. I have 2 other .5oz travel-size PM moisturizers that I like much better than this one, and it will be lots of fun to have a one-on-one duel with them to see which comes out on top. Will it be the one of the same line to my AM moisturizer? Who will win?\n\nI also used up foil samples of a face mask and a face cleanser today. I generally keep them propped up in a closed mason jar until I can finish the whole thing, as I find that each foil contains enough product for a couple uses.\n\nStill left to use up is the remainder of the pan in that EL sample, along with the other 3 shades. I think I'll try and pan 3 of them, but I'm uncertain if the 4th is a good regular color for me. Shade 4 might just sit in my purgatory homemade magnetic palette until I find a way to use it/use it for costumes only. I also have 3 already-opened foils of various skincare categories in mason jars that I want to make use of, even if I don't totally love them. I also have a sample that I want to confirm is breaking me out or not- hopefully not because I like its price, its packaging, and how it feels on my face. The other makeup and skincare products I have are ones that I really like.\n\nI've still got some sample size products that I'm working through (I'm looking at you, unimpressive face oil foil that soaks in less well than sweet almond oil!) and I am not on a no-buy or anything, but I'm getting to the point where I have a routine that works for me.\n\nAbout that no-buy, though...\n\nI'll be moving to another place at the end of next month, even more middle-of-nowhere than here, and I'm not interested in dealing with shipping hassles once I am there. I'm getting the full size of my winner products (mostly off ebay. Don't judge me!) before then and hopefully, my routine will last me until November/through to next year.\n\nThere it is! The life cycle of a sample! It starts out with joy and excitement, becomes overwhelming and then annoying, but ultimately ends in triumph as I find the makeup and skincare that works for me without spending so much money, allowing me to enjoy doing my makeup and take better care of my skin!\n\n(Thanks for reading this if you did. I know it was long, but my SO isn't interested in makeup and no one else around me is interested in it in the same manner that I am.)",

My guess is the amount of patchouli in the accord leads her away from the smell. Strength of scent is strong off the container and remains strong when lathered. \n\nFallout is made from the FLS 2.0 soap base. This base features the addition of goats milk and remains based in tallow. Ingredients are listed as: Beef Tallow, Goats Milk, Aqua, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Jojoba Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Xanthan Gum, Shea Butter, Kokum Butter, Murumuru Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Cupuacu Butter, Cocoa Butter, Fragrance Oil, Kaolin Clay, Tussah Silk. This soap base is mid firm and a mindlessly easy loader. It is thirsty, but not the thirstiest base. When dialed in, the lather feels like sour cream. Slickness in terms of both primary and residual slickness are excellent. Post shave is dramatically improved and is now elite. This is not an incremental base improvement, this is an overhaul. As such First Line Shave FLS 2.0 receives a ShaveScore of 95. For similar performance from a soap base, I suggest: Declaration (bison) and Wholly Kaw (donkey milk). \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - First Line Shave Fallout (purchased)\n* Brush - Mozingo Brushworks “Pure” (gift)\n* Razor - Wellington (purchased)\n* Post - First Line Shave Fallout (purchased)",
