    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "[Find the album here!](http://imgur.com/a/2up5h)\n\nHi AB! I uploaded these pictures a long time ago, about 2 weeks after my first haul, with the idea that I would use the products for six months and then post reviews. Any swatches were also taken at that same time. Six months are up, so I hope my info will help you make better decisions for your skin, body and in turn, your bank account. I will give my thoughts on the product, then leave it a rating out of 5 on the general feel, price and finally, my personal rating (not reflective of the previous ratings). Every link is non-affiliate and I'm posting this on my own accord. The only product that won't be reviewed is the Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream Cotton Fit Samples, as they were a gift.\n\nAdmittedly, as I'm re-reading this I clearly see things I could have done to make this more coherent and easier for you all to understand, but it's a lot of writing and I learned as I went along. I felt like some gossip magazine columnist towards the end, so I'm 100% sorry if that's cringey or off-putting. If I do another review set in future, I hope it'll be better written.\nGoing in order from the photos:\n\n\n*SKIN CARE*\n\n\n**Mizon Original Skin Energy Hyaluronic Acid 100** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_dbe8149455.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-original-skin-energy-hyaluronic-acid-100-30ml.html?search=mizon%20100)\nThis feels similar to Hada Labo original but it's a super small bottle, only 30 ml compared to HL's 170 ml. Way longer ingredient list as well, but my skin swallowed it. It has ceramides and cholesterol, peptide, anti-inflammatory and -aging plant extracts, and adenosine as well as the titular hyaluronic acid (listed as sodium hyaluronate). On RRS it's listed at $10 USD, a 76% discount from $40 USD. I forgot about this when I bought a different hyaluronic acid serum and then pushed it back even more once I got Hada Labo. Turned to it last month when I felt like my skin just couldn't hold moisture, and I don't think I'll go back. It has not broken me out, and I use it right after my BHA/AHA.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>this feels so good to apply. I want to say it smells very, very faintly like some kind of butter/fatty oil? lmao it's not a bad smell at all, it's almost floral. The texture is super slippy and thin, again, like Hada Labo lotion. After application, my face is soft and smooth. It's like my face sucked the stuff into it within a minute.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$9.77 for 30 ml. for what this serum does, less than 10 bucks for 30 ml is an absolute steal. God bless RoseRoseShop.\n\npersonal rating: 5/5\n>I love it. So dearly, I love it. I'll definitely be repurchasing this once I buy from RRS again, and while I'm hesitant to call out holy grails, this is probably mine for moisturizing.\n\n----------\n\n**Tosowoong Syn-Ake Natural Pure Essence** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2dc0196695.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/tosowoong-syn-ake-natural-pure-essence-100ml.html)\nThis was good. It's main purpose seems to be anti-aging. Nothing I remember as truly remarkable, but that might be because I'm barely an adult and thus don't really have any fine lines to speak of. Funnily enough, I don't see anything resembling syn-ake in the ingredients. I still ended up buying this because it has a pretty good-looking formula, which it even touts on the box. Fourth ingredient is niacinamide, and other stars include two different ferments, peptide, centella extract, betaine, hyaluronic acid, and many berry extracts. Despite how unwowed I might seem, I ended up using this up within the 6 months I had it. I suspect it's effects are similar to my Missha FTE Intensive, as in lightened PIH, evened tone/less redness and general lack of irritation. It took a while to see these effects, but because this was used in conjunction with so many new products with brightening ingredients I'm not 100% sure it was the culprit.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Liquidy and clear, smells like nothing. Spreads like any other serum, no complaints here.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$11.80 for 100 ml.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>For me personally, it just doesn't do much. I don’t have any age reversal to see, and even if it did help with my skin tone, I have other products that I know for sure do that. All in all, it's a solid \"good\" from me. If anybody out there with more mature skin and/or fine lines has used this product, please let me know what it did for you!\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Intensive Skin Barrier Serum**\n[CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_38f5180403.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-intensive-skin-barrier-serum-50ml.html?search=Mizon%20Intensive%20Skin%20Barrier%20Serum)\nThis did nothing for me. When I ordered this haul, I had sickly dry winter skin and was desperate for moisture, so what better product than something with \"skin barrier\" right in the name? Turns out, this was hell in a pump. I didn't check the ingredients and was left with a serum that might as well have been smelly pimple slime. I had closed comedones all along my jaw and cheeks, my skin was dry again a few hours after application and the smell made me feel a little sick every time i used it. I've not experienced this with any other AB product. This is more of a testament to using CosDNA zealously than anything else. My bad. To my confusion, the first time I tried to use the pump applicator it wouldn't work. On the bottom of the container, there is a removable cap-looking thing with a notch on the edge that I used to pry it off and fiddle with the stopper that helped to push the product up. Only then was I able to use the pump.\n\nfeel: 2/5\n>Nothing special. Slightly opaque, classic serum consistency. The smell of this is citrusy and reminds me of cheap candles. I'm not one to mind fragrances, but it makes me feel like I need to drink a glass of water and lie down.\n\nprice: 2/5\n>$15.61 for 50 ml, list price is ~$25. Even discounting my personal experience with it, this serum is unimpressive for being one of the more expensive items in this haul. The major ingredients seem to be all filler with a few extracts and some HA tossed in as an afterthought.\n\npersonal rating: 1/5\n>Would not recommend. I have since chucked the bottle, I can’t even use it as a body treatment or hand cream it smells so bad.\n\n----------\n\n**Enprani Dear By Moistfull Booskin** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_0868211750.html) [Product Link](https://us.memebox.com/dear-by-moistfull-booskin)\nI don't really understand this product. It's a very acclaimed toner, which is why I bought it, and I do like it for days when I wear makeup but it puzzles me. My skin never felt dry after using it, but it never felt moisturized either. When I used this before serums, emulsions, creams, etc. it did help them to sink in faster, but over the day my skin felt slightly more parched than usual. I think this helped me to realize that I am really not a toner person. It's typical for me to skip that step most days now, but I do use this when I wear foundation or bb creams/cushions and it does help them wear longer. If you wear makeup often, I would definitely recommend this.\n\nfeel: 4/5\n>Water consistency but with a texture that's like less-stringy snail slime or joseon cream? Yes! Feels good to put on. The smell is strong, like flowery fabric softener. I'm told it's rose scented but I don't know what rose smells like. It dries down to what I would call a matte finish and feeling. Points lost for the eventual dryness and strong smell.\n\nprice: 4.5/5\n>List price now on Memebox is $20 for 120 ml, but I think I paid $18 for this? Regardless, I've used this toner for 6 months and I'm probably only down 20 ml. Worth the investment if it works for you.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>As far as toner goes, I think this will be my go-to forever for makeup prep. I love the smell and the feel, and if I didn't have combination skin, I think this would be perfect. I would recommend this to those with oily skin.\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f37d220631.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-snail-recovery-gel-cream-45ml.html)\nIt's okay, however I much prefer my Cosrx Snail Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence over this. It did help with my acne scars at the time and it's WAY cheaper than cosrx, so I would never be overly harsh on it. I notice some peptides and plant extracts at the bottom of the ingredients, so that's neat. I think this is a good cream for those who want to dip their toes in the pool of snail products without investment. This was my very first haul, after all, and this cream was my gateway to snail. I use this for my legs and other body parts and have nothing bad to say about it.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Cool and jello-y without the messy stringiness of pure snail. Slightly opaque with an earthly cosmetic smell. Dries like a dream.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$4.20 for 45 ml, a total steal.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>Overall, I just have a better snail cream that I prefer over this one. Would still repurchase this as a cheap snail body cream since it's a blessing for ingrown hairs.\n\n----------\n\n**OST C20 Original Pure Vitamin C20 Serum** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e7e3205117.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/o-s-t-c20-original-pure-vitamin-c20-serum-30ml.html?search=c20)\nThis stuff stung like a quick slap to the face every time I used it, but I'm told that's normal. It smells like sharp orange juice and is thick and sticky. It dries like that too, feels like a second skin and not in a good way. It oxidized super fast in the 4 month period that I used it. I stored it in a dark place and in fairly low temperatures. I did like the effects it left me with: a more uniform texture, lightened dark spots, a not-quite-oily-but-definitely-not-matte glow However, the hassle surrounding vit c is too much for me to deal with every day, especially for only 4 months of use.\n\nfeel: 2/5\n>Real, real gross. Very pungent citrus scent. On your skin, it feels kind of like what evaporated sea salt looks like if you feel me. I have to wipe off residue by applying my next step with a cotton pad.\n\nprice: 4/5\n>$11.23 for 30 ml. Not terrible, by far. I'm sure that if you use this serum very diligently you'll be able to use it up before it's the color of maple syrup.\n\npersonal rating: 3/5\n>It's okay. I know that vitamin c isn't supposed to be hydrating or even comfortable, but I feel like there are better, more stable formulas out there, and when people on the sub circlejerk about how unstable this stuff really is, they aren't kidding. If I were to try vitamin c again, I would not repurchase this product.\n\n\n*MAKEUP*\n\n\n**Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream Cover & Bright Fit in W02 Light Beige** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2571201744.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/etude-house-precious-mineral-bb-cream-cover-and-bright-fit-35g-spf30-pa.html?search=Etude%20House%20Precious%20Mineral%20BB%20Cream)\nAND\n**Holika Holika Nabi Cream SPF 25 PA++ in Cottony** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e6f1197705.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=60408&search=holika+nabi)\nTo be up front, I don't wear makeup very often and I have very little to compare this to. My skin's texture is fairly even, but I find my complexion is sallow with dots of PIH here and there, plus the discoloration of faint freckles. Have some [swatches](https://m.imgur.com/a/J0xdx) in artificial light, flash and natural light. Left to right is just primer, then just bb, then bb on top of primer blended out. \nThis will be a bit longer of a review. I used this in conjunction with the Holika Holika Nabi Cream, so I will group these together. I really like this bb cream and primer. They work well together, do not break me out and the color matches me nicely. It looks quite orange at first, but paired with the primer I feel it evens out to a pinky-peach shade. I do not understand undertones, I get very frustrated trying to figure them out for products and my own skin (I still understand heck-all about whether I'm cool, warm or soylent green). So, if anybody out there has this bb cream or would like to make an educated assumption based on the photos on what undertone it is, please let me know and I'll put it in bold.\n\nThe Etude House bb dries down to a semi-matte finish. It does not feel oily or overly-dry at first, however I do mist my face with a moisturizing toner as I like a more sheer look. Depending on how much you layer, you can get moderate to full coverage. However, I would not recommend more than two layers because you can get real cakey real quick. For reference, I always wear one light layer. I find that wearing this without a facial mist dries out my normal/oily combo skin, accentuating both dry and oily parts of my face. Again, this is a somewhat matte formula, so it’s dry by nature. It wears well for about 10 hours, which is when it starts to wear off a little patchy and become overly-shiny. I like this so much that I am looking to purchase the moist version cushion.\n\nThe Holika Holika primer is super nice. It's tinted purple, which gives a subtle brightening effect. The cream feels lightweight and smoothing, like a good primer should. While not feeling tacky, it still helps bb cream to adhere to the skin and last longer. I don't think I would recommend this to those with large pores since it seems to be more of a color correcting product and the smoothing and filling effect is minimal. The Nabi line has 3 shades: Cottony, Vitality and Shiny. Cottony is purple, Vitality is pink, and Shiny is beige. In the imgur album, I listed the one I have as Vitality since that's what I ordered, but now I'm pretty sure that I had Cottony all this time? I didn't think much of it at the time since I'm bad with color and I really liked the results I got with it. This may be the only mishap with RRS I've had to date, and it ended up being a gift since pink makes me look overly-red (EH Face Blur, I love you.... but why?).\n\nfeel: 4.5/5\n>The primer is excellent for what it does. I do not have enlarged pores, so it's really convenient for me to have a primer that acts as both a color corrector and makeup base without being heavy. Etude house makes my favorite bb creams, and it's nice to find a color that matches my semi-light, mystery-undertoned skin while wearing beautifully. The only complaint that I have is the slightly short wear-time and the dryness of the standalone cream. If you like matte/semi-matte products, I would recommend this because it's still a lot gentler than other matte foundations I've tried. Both of these smell like makeup, not overly perfumed or sickly but just kind of like setting powder.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$5.83 for 35g (bb cream) & $7.83 for 50g (primer). Super economical, and it's still amazing. I wear makeup sparingly, so these both will probably last me just under their full 12 month shelf lives.\n\npersonal rating: 4.5/5\n>I'm not one to settle on one product, especially with skincare, but I really feel no inclination to try out any other primers. Between this and my Etude House Face Blur, I'm all good. Would definitely repurchase. For the bb cream, I'll probably use this one all up before trying out its moist cushion type. I really love Etude House for makeup: really good formulas, my skin has no problems with it and all their products look really pretty. Would repurchase from the same brand/makeup line.\n\n----------\n\n**Etude House Dear Darling Tint in 01 Berry Red** [Product Link - Ingredients are not on CosDNA, but can be found in the \"Ingredients\" tab on its Memebox page](https://us.memebox.com/dear-darling-tint-01-berry-red)\nSkipping ahead a little here, but this is still makeup I suppose. I am kind of impartial to this line of tints. They are very pretty and stain well, but they don't last through me biting my lips and applying balm all the time. I am forever searching for one that will, but these do a good job for now. I own two of their tints now. Have [more swatches](http://i.imgur.com/d3r9zxe.jpg) with Berry Red on the left and Vampire Red on the right. The berry red smells sweet, like some kind of fruity candy. It wears well for about an hour before I've bitten or rubbed it off.\n\nfeel: 4/5\n>Smells amazing, decently pigmented and beautiful color. This is a gel type tint, and application can be streaky. The applicator and rim can also become very messy. Color probably lasts longer if you don't eat your lips throughout the day.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$6 for 4.5g. It does run out kind of fast, but for Memebox it's a solid price for the product amount.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>I like this, but I don't like having to reapply all the time. I'll probably keep looking for a tint that survives my lip biting and moisturizing habit. I recommend it to those who can generally leave their lips alone.\n\n\n*CLEANSING*\n\n\n**Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**[CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5319235682.html) [Product Link](https://us.memebox.com/low-ph-good-morning-gel-cleanser)\nI love this cleanser. It's my holy grail for body wash and my go-to for gentle wash after chemical peels. It's a perfect, simple gel cleanser. It does not strip my skin of moisture, it helps keeps my body blemish-free and it lasts for-damn-ever. Seriously, I use this every day and I only just ran out of my first bottle. It contains no sls, but it does of course still have other surfactants and \"sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\". I tend to follow [Fifty Shades of Snail's theory](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/08/23/review-tosowoong-enzyme-powder-wash/) on acidic cleansers and harsh surfactants anyway, and this cleanser clocks in at around 5.5 pH.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Like most low-pH cleansers, it leaves my skin feeling clean, but not dry. It smells noticeably like tea tree oil, (which is a scent I love very much so it scores even more points) and it lathers lightly using just your hands or moderately if you use a washcloth or exfoliating gloves. I use the body shop's brand of exfoliating gloves in conjunction with this, and my skin is always smooth and happily clear of any kind acne.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$10 for 150 ml. RoseRoseShop has it listed for $6.07 and Jolse for $8.80 at the time of writing this review. is gud price friend.\n\npersonal rating: 5/5\n>Holy Grail status achieved. I used to suffer from some pretty frequent breakouts on my back and butt (if you know me personally and are reading this just know that my butt is smooth as hell now, heck outta here) until I started using this cleanser, and now that I combine it with exfoliating gloves I have literally none of the problem spots or painful cysts that I'd been getting since puberty. I will forever continue to purchase this product and have bought 2 more bottles since running out of my first one a couple days ago.\n\n----------\n\n**Holika Holika Soda Pore Cleansing Cleansing Soda Water** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f87f134194.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=60172)\nThis palindrome of a product name belongs to my current eye makeup remover. I bought this product (as well as the Holika Holika primer) after seeing it in the routine of an AB/skincare youtuber named Elaine Mokk. Love her content and reviews despite it being less \"this works, here's why\" and more \"this was cute, it also happened to be a decent product this time\". Anyway, this cleansing water's main ingredients are water and alcohol. I suspect this is why I have problems with it. Not because I'm sensitive to alcohol, which I'm not, but because for me, the purpose of this product as an eye remover means that when it gets in my eye, it's a shitshow. It stings substantially and I end up rubbing my eyes like a madwoman trying to get it over with. I thought that maybe I was using too much product, and while using less made it more bearable and in most cases kept it from getting past my lashes and into my delicate corneas, the pump on this thing is a nightmare. No matter how gently and slowly you try to press the plunger top, you always press too hard and end up with a wet cotton round and a dry office-stare of contempt at the bottle. I thought that I would use this up to avoid being wasteful, but considering that I'm already worried about the integrity and health of my eyes, I think I'll be giving this away or selling it on ABExchange to somebody who would use it for the face instead. It's not bad at removing makeup, it's just not good for eyes.\n\nfeel: 1/5\n>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$6.63 for 150 ml. A great price if you can make it work for you.\n\npersonal rating: 2/5\n>I'm only giving it a 2 because it still removes makeup well. Otherwise, it's totally unenjoyable for what I wanted to use it for. Side note, I used this on my face to remove foundation a few times and found that it worked pretty good, about the same as my camellia and jojoba oil blend. I just don't see myself giving that up for this product, though.\n\n\n*MISCELLANEOUS*\n\n\n**Skinfood Argan Oil Silk Hair Mist**\nThis product apparently no longer exists. It's not on the site I bought it from, it's not on the skinfood website or CosDNA and if you google \"skinfood argan oil silk hair mist\" you get one defunct Skinfood US listing and literally 4 pictures on the images tab that show the product I have. I suppose the argan oil hair line has been reformulated and the mist fell under the radar or it was an exclusive. I'm betting on the former.\nLong story short, I have a love-hate relationship with this. When I bought it, I had no idea what was in it, what problems it claimed to target or what its reputation was. I've been doing no-poo since I was 15 years old and using 100% undiluted baking soda on my scalp, straight scooped out of the orange box and dumped it on my head until I wizened the hell up and used the rest of the time I spend on my hair up to this point doing damage control. Now that the hair that was once on top of my head is at the bottom, I've got basically straw for ends. I was in a state of denial about needing a haircut after not having had one for over 9 months and was looking for some help with fried ends and breakage. This mist is very nice. It smells very floral, if argan oil smells like what I think it smells like, then this smells like that. I remember one of the claims was that the main extract in the formula is broccoli extract. It also claims to have hydrolyzed silk. Whatever it was (and I know what it was), my hair looked amazing. It was sleek and kempt, no flyaways, the broken hairs around the crown of my head stayed down and my ends didn't look as much like a dollar store paintbrush. I used it often.  I took it upon myself to translate the ingredients on the back via google translate's draw feature, plugging in the hangul one at a time.\n\n>Purified water, Ethanol, Glycerin, PEG-Q150, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Polysorbate 20, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glutamic Acid, Dimethicone,\n\nI stopped at dimethicone, which is a big \"don't\" ingredient for my hair and the whole point of the no shampoo method. I like this mist a lot, but not enough to go back to conventional shampoo and conditioner. I’m also not sure if the effects of it were really as great as I thought they were or if it was all the reintroduction of silicone. Since the stuff is out of production anyway, I don’t think it matters. I’ll probably sell/give this away too.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Lightweight, smells great, helps with styling and general appearance.\n\nprice: 4/5\n>$6.43 for 145 ml, which is not bad but considering mists are supposed to be used liberally, you’d go through this fairly fast.\n\npersonal rating: 3/5\n>I’d use this product if it was friendly to my preferences. The ingredients don’t look impressive aside from hydrolyzed glycosaminoglycans, which is an amino sugar that supposedly promotes growth and extends the life cycle of hair. Maybe I’ll try it again and end up changing my routine to incorporate it just to see if it helps.\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Acence AC Care Solution Mark X Blemish After Cream** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_3050164581.html) [Product Link]( http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-acence-ac-care-solution-mark-x-blemish-after-cream-30ml.html)\nThis is an after-care cream that’s meant to be used on spots that have just been squeezed. That’s all I can gather from the little infographic that RoseRoseShop has. I used this on both blemishes that had been drained and ones that had not and I was surprised at how well this worked. My dark spots faded much quicker and after using it there were no recurrences of any of the pimples that I squeezed. It did not irritate my skin. This cream does leave a really waxy residue, though. The directions say to let it absorb into your skin, but it never fully does. Maybe that’s the way it’s supposed to be, but if you use it before bed it can get smeared on your pillow, face and hair. The ingredients are all very promising and effective, which I generally find is a theme for Mizon products. Let’s say a blemish takes 1 week to heal over completely; with this cream applied once every night, overnight, the time is shortened to around 4 days.\n\nfeel: 3/5\n>The effect of this product comes with a price: super waxy, oily film left behind. If you are sensitive to olive oil, try this at your own risk. At one point, I thought this cream was breaking me out, but I have used this many times after that and found that I was wrong.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$4.93 for a 30 ml tube.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>I like what it does for my trouble spots and can tolerate any greasiness that comes with it. I said I used it on both squeezed and closed spots, and I can definitely tell that it’s more effective on a drained area than one that still has gunk beneath the surface.\n\nThat’s it! If you have any questions, leave a comment and I’ll answer with any information that I have (^:",

It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The “factors” they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind.

But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them 🙄. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called “Odele Volumizing Shampoo” which I used before Prose. And yall… The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that’s what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

I get really confused on this topic because I know they say not to use SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) or SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate) to minimize color fading, but I see that a lot of hair ingredients list things that sound very similar to these ingredients such as: sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate and sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, both of which are found in the ouai detox shampoo. Those ingredients are just an example, but basically like anytime I see any of the terms Sodium, Lauryl/Laureth, Sulfate, or anything that ends with -ate, on their own or in conjuction with something else in hair ingredients, I am scared that means the ingredient/product isn't color safe and will ruin my hair. Sorry if this was long, this has just been a months long frustration of mine that I'd like to figure out if I can. Any help would be appreciated!",

It's a bit more complicated than just identifying one ingredient.  But ultimately, water itself will make your hair fade more than most shampoos, so the best way to minimize color fading while washing the hair is to minimize the number of rinses.  This could be done by using a moisturizing shampoo or co-wash, and then skipping the rinse-out conditioner and only using a leave-in.  Decreasing the frequency of washing will help as well, but that might lead to more scalp issues, so keep an eye on that if you're prone to dandruff or other scalp issues.\n\nAlso keep in mind that UV rays from the sun are also quite damaging and contribute to color fading, so protect the hair from sunlight as well.",

I accidentally get products containing silicone in my hair on a daily basis and have no way of removing them. I am also concerned about the potential effects of getting my sunscreen stuck in my hair next to my skin.\n\nI no longer think that dimethicone is a bad or dispensable ingredient. I understand the difference between sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, as well as the difference between cyclomethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone and amodimethicone. I just bought a shampoo containing the mild surfactant sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate and a conditioner containing dimethicone after spending an hour reading the back of haircare products at the shops. Crazy, man! This is a huge deal and I'm totally jittery.\n\nI think that no-poo can work well for some people, mainly those with short or curly hair. I have long, semi-straight hair, and no matter how much I used my BBB I could not get my hair smooth. I had frizzy, split ends just a short time after getting my hair cut. I kinda succeeded for a long time while telling myself that this was what healthy hair looked like, then I reassessed my needs and here I am. I got all of the damaged hair cut off today and I'm ready to try this shit out.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

Even so, everyone can learn and benefit from at least some of the techniques and knowledge of no poo, that they can take with them even if they don't stick to no poo. Using a low-poo is still waaaaaaay better than an SLS shampoo.\n\nIf the BBB you tried doesn't work for your hair type (I'm wondering if it has a lot of plastic bristles mixed in, because often they do, and those damage hair), I highly HIGHLY recommend getting a wooden bristled brush-- whether you are no poo or not. The bristles are spread far apart, still flexible if you get one of the squishy brushes, and the wood does distribute natural hair oils a bit, which is still beneficial even if (or especially if) you use a low-poo or shampoo cleanser. It can give some life back to your ends between washes without looking greasy or damaging your hair. You can get them at whole foods or health foods stores or online. Best of luck to you!",

Suited for oily, acne prone, combination skin\n\n**Texture:** Transparent liquid with green granules type beads\n\n**Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** It was pretty okay. I didn’t enjoy either the fragrance or the texture. It has tiny green granules, granules not beads that usually absorb into your skin on pressing between your fingers. Due to it, it has felt like a mild scrub than a facewash and I’m not comfortable using a scrub like product on my face daily.\n\nIt also felt mildly harsh on my skin, which is why after a few uses, I was easily turned off. \n\nI still have the product left, that I’m now using to clean makeup brushes. It might work on other skins, but not for me. \n\n**➡️Re’equil Fruit AHA Face Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 490/- for 200 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Fruit AHAs\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Decyl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Aqua, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/​Leaf Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Buteth-3, Tributyl Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Ci 19140, Ci 45100\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, sulphates, silicones & mineral oil.\n \n**Texture:** Yellow coloured fluid. (almost looks like Pee)\n\n**Fragrance:** No fragrance\n\n**Packaging:** Bottle\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** This is the harshest facewash I’ve ever used in my life. The texture is so watery but generates foam easily after coming in contact with water. However, after every wash, my skin felt very tight, which  is why after a few washes, I stopped using it.\n\nSeeing as I still had some product left, I decided to use it instead of shower gel. Damn, My skin felt so smooth after first wash that since then, I’ve been using them as Shower gels for Bath. \n\nI wouldn’t recommend this facewash to anyone seeing how harsh it was compared to other facewash. So think before you buy.\n\n_________________\n\nThanks for reading 💕",

    "body": "Unfortunately, I've fallen in love with a shampoo that I can't afford. I was wondering if there was a cheaper shampoo out there that had similar ingredients/properties/etc. I know that it contains a \"patented Healthy Hair Molecule (OFPMA)\" so it may be difficult to find something close enough. \n\n**Some Background Info:**\n\nI have fine/thin shoulder length virgin (undyed) hair. I don't use any styling products or tools. I typically shampoo every two days, air dry, detangle with a wide tooth comb when dry, and wear up in a loose messy bun most of the time. I don't use conditioner.\n\nMy current apartment has very hard water, and I don't have the option of installing a water softener or anything like that. \n\nSulfate free or low sulfate shampoos don't clean my scap well enough, and shampoos with SLS or SLES tend to irritate my scalp and cause increased hair fallout. \n\nLiving Proof shampoo is the only one I've found that cleans well, does not strip or dry my hair, and leaves my scalp happy. It's just lovely silky hair and a balanced scalp. I am not knowledgeable enough, however, to figure out why!\n\n**The ingredients list is here:** \n\n*Water/Eau/Aqua, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Octafluoropentyl Methacrylate (OFPMA), PCA Glyceryl Oleate, Behenyl Alcohol, PEG-150 Pentaerithrityl Tetrastearate, IPDI/PEG-15 Soyamine Copolymer Dimer Dilinoleate, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleammonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-47, Laureth-4, Laureth-23, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Fragrance/Parfum, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Magnesium Nitrate, Magnesium Chloride.*",

        "body": "Okay so this might not be a perfect answer, but I have similar hair to you (fine, short, straight, on the oily side) and have used a bunch of different dry shampoos (thanks to Sephora Play for continually sending me new ones....) I think my top budget recommendations would be either Batiste or Dove Beauty.\n\nIf you're interested in attempting to DIY it, I've also used cornstarch with cinnamon and cocoa added (for color since I'm a brunette) and it works super well. It might leave more build up on your scalp than you want, but on days when I know I'm stretching it but don't want to wash, it gets rid of oiliness incredibly well and leaves my hair feeling pretty clean.",

    "body": "I did bury the company name somewhat, but if you made it here, you'll find it. Everything I say here is my opinion based solely on their website content, and I've never tried their products or even heard of them before today. Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

I use one pump, twice a day, and when it comes in contact with water, it generates just the right amount of beautiful foam.  It is super easy to rinse off, nothing lingers behind.  My skin feels refreshed and clean but not dried out.\n\n**Results:**  I fell in love.  This is my holy grail cleanser, hands down.  It helps my skin retain moisture and cleanses without aggravating redness.  And a huge bonus for me is that it smells like lavender, but I know that isn't for everyone.\n\n**Packaging:**  Standard plastic bottle and pump.  Nothing remarkable in that aspect.\n\n**Repurchase?**  Already did!  I've had a bottle on stand-by since July because I kept thinking I'd run out faster than I actually did.  This stuff lasts *forever*.",

    "body": "Hello all, I have a lot of questions.    \n\n\n\nHair type : fine, thin, pin-straight asian hair    \n\n\nScalp : naturally very dry (My facial skin is super dry too)    \n\n\nWash : every other day since I live in a hot and humid country and sweat and exercise a lot....    \n\n\nDilemma : shampooing and conditioning my hair with the two products below makes my scalp dry and itchy (not psisoraris or eczema, just dry) but when I don't do it, it also becomes itchy and gross due to sweat  and oil buildup    \n\n\n\n\nI use the sebamed normal shampoo    \n\n\nAqua, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, PEG-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxypropyl Oxidized Starch PG-Trimonium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, PEG-18 Glyceryl Oleate/Cocoate, Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate    \n\n\n\nMy scalp feels way too stripped after shampooing and I'm gonna change to the sukin shampoo reocmmended in the recommendations page    \n\n\n\nAnd the petal fresh tea tree conditioner with tea tree as the key ingredient.    \n\n\n\nAqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate (Derived from Coconut), Betaine (Derived from Sugar Beets), Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate (Derived from Coconut Oil), Ammonium Cocoyl Isethionate (Derived from Coconut Oil), Hydroxypropylcellulose (Derived from Cotton Fiber), *Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Orbignya Oleifera (Babassu) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Derived from Coconut Oil), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Glycerin (Derived from Vegetable Oil), *Tussilago Farfara (Coltsfoot) Flower Extract, *Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow) Extract, *Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail) Extract,\n*Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, *Althaea Officinalis (Marshmallow) Leaf Extract, *Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, *Melissa Officinalis (Lemon Balm) Leaf Extract, *Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Extract, Polysorbate-20 (Derived from Coconut Oil), Citric Acid (Derived from Citrus Fruit), Dehydroacetic Acid (Derived from Cane Sugar), Ethylhexylglycerin (Derived from Vegetable Oil), Sodium Chloride (Derived from Salt),    \n\n\n\nI use it as a conditioner by massaging it and then leaving it for 25-30 mins. I don't understand why my scalp is still dry and itchy when it's supposed to soothe me with all the nourishing ingredients. I also have a bad habit of scalp picking due to severe anxiety (that I'm trying hard to cut), I know tea tree is drying as the small portion of spillage on my forehead is dry....    \n\n\n\nI used to use coconut oil as a hair mask but I stopped cause I can't stand the smell and it's so hard to get out too. I had to shampoo 3x and then my scalp would be dry again ugh.    \n\n\n\nI can't find the products recommended for dry sensitive scalp in my local drugstores so I buy products with similar ingredients cheap and accessible to me.    \n\n\n\nQuestion 1 : does this mean tea tree doesn't work for me? A lot of the recommended conditioners have all these ingredients of the petal fresh, this brand is really cheap and accessible to me too. Where did it go wrong?    \n\n\nQuestion 2 : the products recommendations page recommended tresemme naturals conditioner but It was discontinued and I read reviews that says it has to be used as a leave in and not a rinse conditioner. That baffled me! How do I know it's if a rinse or leave in?    \n\n   \n\nQuestion 3 : I plan on buying the sukin protein conditioner, is this okay?    \n\n\nWater (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract (Nettle), Arctium Lappa Root Extract (Burdock), Equisetum Arvense Extract (Horsetail), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil (Rose Hip), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Citrus Nobili   \n\nI got a lot of help last time. Thank you so much!! Any and all help would be greatly, greatly appreciated. My scalp feels so dry and itchy as in typing this. ",

Doesn't seem to have anything to do with sulfate, or the usual things people say to avoid. My only suggestion is to buy somewhere that takes returns with no questions! Or, buy cheap stuff so you don't go broke trying to figure it out. I spent years (and wayyyyy too much energy) trying to figure out which certain ingredients to avoid, and never figured it out. I have adverse reactions to lots of things, especially meds, so researching other peoples' opinions/reviews doesn't usually work for me....it's all trial and error. 😣",

    "body": "It’s finally here LOL…my Review for the Cleanser that pretty much everyone else besides me has tried. I don’t know if I have much more to say that hasn’t already been said. But, this Cleanser seems to be a real love it or hate it type of Product…and I fall somewhere in between.\n\nSome of the basics…this Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser is a lightweight gel style cleanser that claims to offer a thorough cleanse without being stripping. \n\nFeatured Ingredients here include Japanese Snowbell Extracts, Saccharomyces Ferment, Japanese Cedar Leaf Extract, Lotus Leaf Extract, BHA, and Tea Tree Oil.\n\nEven with the Low pH-ness and thin gel…this Cleanser foamed/lathered really nicely! I really did have a nice time applying and massaging this Product into my Skin. Using my whip-maker created a super dense foam that lasted a really long time. \n\nAs for the result on my Skin??? It has been rather nice LOL! I know, I know…half of you are like “YES” and have of you are like “Anthony is cancelled”. \n\nOnce thing to keep in mind is that I started using this Cleanser after coming off of the Mad Hippie Cream Cleanser. That Product left me super congested and oily after a month and I really needed something with a bit of “power” to make my Skin happy again. This Low pH Cleanser from Cosrx was the perfect fit to be honest. \n\nHowever, once my Skin returned to normal…there were times where I felt a bit dry after using this Product (I used it both day and night). \n\nAbout a week ago, I actually over exfoliated a bit with the Tend Skin Solution and was feeling that tight/sunburn-y feeling on my cheeks. I really needed a Cleanser that was extra gentle and calming…but this Cosrx Cleanser just didn’t have that quality and it was probably something I should have set aside until my Skin was repaired. It didn’t hurt anything really…but it didn’t soothe/calm/hydrate my Skin which is what I probably needed at the time.\n\nAll in all, when my Skin is in its normal Oily/Combination/Sebum-y state…this is a really great Product. It wasn’t stripping (for me) and has some nice Ingredients that help to keep acne at bay. But, for compromised or super sensitive Skin…this is probably a bit too much. Also, those with dry Skin that are tackling acne may want to use this one only once a day or every other day. \n\nThere you have it, I think I will keep this Product in mind for a later purchase if my Skin becomes super clogged/congested in the future. It’s also a really good value that I can look to in a pinch. For my Skincare Fam that is looking for an affordable Cleanser to address Oily/Combination/Acne Prone Skin…I think this is a fine option. However, if budget allows you to spend a bit more…I find the Youth To The People Gel Cleanser to offer some similar results while not being quite as “intense”. That Product doesn’t contain Tea Tree or BHA so it may be more approachable to a wider variety of Skin Types and conditions. \n\nOh…and about that scent LOL! I personally didn’t have an issue with it. It verges on cheap floor cleaner scent LOL…but it stayed just far enough away from that for me to kind of like it. Those of you that dislike minty/pine-y/Tea Tree-y scents will most likely throw this bottle across the bathroom in disgust. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polysorbate 20, Styrax Japonicus Branch/Fruit/Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Saccharomyces Ferment, Cryptomeria Japonica Leaf Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Leaf Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Betaine Salicylate, Citric Acid, Ethyl Hexanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy:\n\nSoko Glam ($12.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/cosrx/products/cosrx-low-ph-good-morning-cleanser](https://sokoglam.com/collections/cosrx/products/cosrx-low-ph-good-morning-cleanser) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1o1y7deavn41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ced0af00f204912da11c4c32aa2a386de445409d",

    "body": "Hair\n\nHairtype: Oily with dry ends, sensitive and dandruff-prone scalp\n\nDaxxin Shampoo Extra Volume\n\nAqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Chloride, Glycereth-7 Caprylate/Caprate, Piroctone Olamine, Polyquaternium-47, Glycerin, Xylitol, Lactitol, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Disodium Edta, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate.\n\nContains piroctone olamine, an anti-fungal. Love this as an everyday shampoo, very mild fruity scent. Not sure about the volumizing, but cleans well for a sulfate-free shampoo.\n\nWella Invigo Sensitive Mask\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Betaine, Panthenol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Valine, Methylparaben, Allantoin, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\nLove this hair mask, one of the very few that I’ve found that’s fungal acne safe. I can use it close to my scalp without an uncomfortable feeling.\n\nI haven’t found a great conditioner. Right now I use The Ordinary’s conditioner, which is very basic but at least detangles my knotty hair. Does contain cetearyl alcohol.\n\n\nFace\n\nSkintype: Oily but easily dehydrated, acne-prone\n\nAvène Cicalfate+ Purifying Cleansing Gel\n\nAvene Aqua, Aqua, Glycerin, Disodium Coco-Glucoside Citrate, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Pentylene Glycol, Aquaphilus Dolomiae Ferment Filtrate, Arginine, Citric Acid, Copper Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Trisodium, Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Sulfate.\n\nI haven’t seen much written about this cleanser, but I think it’s really good. Mild but cleansing, non-drying for a gel (more of a liquid texture). It’s blue in color due to the copper in it.\n\nDr. Eddie's Happy Cappy Medicated Shampoo\n\nI bit the bullet and ordered this from iHerb (expensive from where I am). It’s really good, I can use it on my face for a couple of minutes and still not get super dry. Calms down the small spots. I use it about three times a week.\n\nGeek & Gorgous Hydration Station\n\nWater, C15-19 Alkane, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG/ PPG/ Polybutylene Glycol-8/ 5/ 3 Glycerin, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Ectoin, Xylitylglucoside, Bisabolol, Allantoin, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Glucose, Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nVery moisturising for a moisturiser geared towards oily skin and it doesn’t break me out.  Great for winter.\n\nBioderma Sebium Sensitive\n\nAqua/Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Dipropylene Glycol, Zinc Gluconate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Sodium Polyacrylate, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Bakuchiol, Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Sodium Metabisulfite, Rhamnose, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Tocopherol, Fructooligosaccharides, Fragrance (Parfum).\n\nLight moisturiser, it’s fragranced but I don’t mind this particular scent (kind of fresh). Actually feels soothing on the skin, but only 30 ml. \n\nBonus:\n\nPurito Daily Soft Touch Sunscreen\n\nWater, Propanediol, Dibutyl Adipate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Amylopectin, Butylene Glycol, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Glycerin, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Disterarate, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Carbomer, Tromethamine, Decyl Glucoside, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Alpha-Bisabolol, Panthenol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ceramide NP, Dipropylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide NS, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide EOP\n\nThis sunscreen is not technically safe (esters), but for some reason it works for me. I have tried a LOT of sunscreens and they break me out, makes me shiny, dehydrates etc. The finish is not matte, but not shiny on me when in sinks in. And it doesn’t break me out!",

        "body": "It looks like a somewhat gentle cleanser, but I don't think this shampoo will help much with dandruff.  The herbs included aren't particularly antifungal, and dandruff is often caused by fungal overgrowth.  If you want a gentle, natural shampoo that's going to help fight dandruff, you might try the [Faith in Nature rosemary shampoo](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/faith-in-nature-rosemary-shampoo-60019691), or a tea tree oil shampoo like [Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Giovanni-Cosmetics-Triple-Invigorating-Conditioner/dp/B0011UVCKU/ref=sr_1_15_sspa?crid=BD3ZMNERYDBT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.pm4KXp9UQKtRLRg9wTgATx_Gl-us353mbx7opTGWVJOAdSL-n8Lmd4voFuXt7PeQhWjp3_fseu2wUJm3RfQeDa3nQ_s1DWfGZxperZU2eIwAaLLBTHPy8XoFaINn2sxjBdmzPswkcr6wqB95MXD0oThIK_YS25GnnZS6KB4tBAZPsL_mSPbMRVeSbwyuLrPeENIPU20bYwEjqfOw9zorRYESQK3hgPqu3w0eaVxJmgfyejQxGxqzX_YuUWsB7Zk-R1EYfsphZL47gj_E5XHCOW_YodHK9fBa-AVtD_hUUYc.KdqC32l0HqTX4rFNB9ysF8fTZuphx1zBl8-ni7pDWsY&dib_tag=se&keywords=giovanni+tea+tree+shampoo&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1729591824&refresh=1&sprefix=giovanni+tea+tree%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-15-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&psc=1).  (I'm using UK amazon links as I'm assuming that you're in the UK because of the Holland & Barrett link.) You would need to moisturize your hair after shampooing somehow; there is a section in the wiki of this sub for natural moisturizers.  I don't recommend diluting the shampoo to minimize the drying effect, because then you'd also be diluting the concentration of the herbs which can help fight the dandruff.  Another option is to try co-washing with a tea tree oil conditioner instead; the Giovanni tea tree oil conditioner is a great option for this.  It wouldn't dry out the hair and you'd get the same benefit of the antifungal herbs.  Co-washing involves applying conditioner as if it's shampoo, massaging it really well into the scalp and hair, which can help break up some of the oil and buildup because conditioners have gentle cleansing agents in them as well, and oils can break down other oils.\n\nDo you do any mechanical cleaning to maintain the scalp, or are you just rinsing your hair with water?  If you don't currently do mechanical cleaning, it's an important aspect of scalp care in No Poo hair washing.  There is an article linked in the side column on Water Only washing that explains what's involved for mechanical cleaning.",

Nizoral will probably dry out your scalp but dandruff means fungal overgrowth and fungus loves moisture. If rhe dryness becomes unbearable try using less + if you have medium-long hair you can still condition the ends. The only home remedies I know for the fungus that causes this is salt water and apple cider vinegar but never tried them because most home remedies I've tried have been BS. Might also be worth looking at your lifestyle and diet and see if you've changed anything as dandruff can be triggered by other health conditions or life changes e.g. mine was triggered by a hormonal treatment but went away when I stopped. Then I got it SO bad when I was vaping daily that it even spread to my face and I had to use canesten cream on my face twice a day (my hypothesis is because vape juices usually contain sugar alcohol sweeteners and fungus likes sugar but im not a scientist so who knows lol) but again after a week of quitting all the dandruff was gone",

But, this Cleanser seems to be a real love it or hate it type of Product…and I fall somewhere in between.\n\nSome of the basics…this Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser is a lightweight gel style cleanser that claims to offer a thorough cleanse without being stripping. \n\nFeatured Ingredients here include Japanese Snowbell Extracts, Saccharomyces Ferment, Japanese Cedar Leaf Extract, Lotus Leaf Extract, BHA, and Tea Tree Oil.\n\nEven with the Low pH-ness and thin gel…this Cleanser foamed/lathered really nicely! I really did have a nice time applying and massaging this Product into my Skin. Using my whip-maker created a super dense foam that lasted a really long time. \n\nAs for the result on my Skin??? It has been rather nice LOL! I know, I know…half of you are like “YES” and have of you are like “Anthony is cancelled”. \n\nOnce thing to keep in mind is that I started using this Cleanser after coming off of the Mad Hippie Cream Cleanser. That Product left me super congested and oily after a month and I really needed something with a bit of “power” to make my Skin happy again. This Low pH Cleanser from Cosrx was the perfect fit to be honest. \n\nHowever, once my Skin returned to normal…there were times where I felt a bit dry after using this Product (I used it both day and night). \n\nAbout a week ago, I actually over exfoliated a bit with the Tend Skin Solution and was feeling that tight/sunburn-y feeling on my cheeks. I really needed a Cleanser that was extra gentle and calming…but this Cosrx Cleanser just didn’t have that quality and it was probably something I should have set aside until my Skin was repaired. It didn’t hurt anything really…but it didn’t soothe/calm/hydrate my Skin which is what I probably needed at the time.\n\nAll in all, when my Skin is in its normal Oily/Combination/Sebum-y state…this is a really great Product. It wasn’t stripping (for me) and has some nice Ingredients that help to keep acne at bay. But, for compromised or super sensitive Skin…this is probably a bit too much. Also, those with dry Skin that are tackling acne may want to use this one only once a day or every other day. \n\nThere you have it, I think I will keep this Product in mind for a later purchase if my Skin becomes super clogged/congested in the future. It’s also a really good value that I can look to in a pinch. For my Skincare Fam that is looking for an affordable Cleanser to address Oily/Combination/Acne Prone Skin…I think this is a fine option. However, if budget allows you to spend a bit more…I find the Youth To The People Gel Cleanser to offer some similar results while not being quite as “intense”.

    "body": "Hello\n\nI have been growing my hair out for almost 1 year. I used a shampoo that contained sulphates and used no conditioner :$. But recently i switched to a sulphate free shampoo and conditioner from petal fresh (Ingredients below). I used your ingredient checker to see if these products were okay and they were :).\n\nBut now i got this problem that after i wash my hair and use the conditioner my hair kinda feels waxy and heavy (for some reason its mostly at the back of the head) + my ends of my hair kinda feel brittle. Like there's something in it but i pay attention that i rinse everything out. But when i wash my hair it kinda sticks together and is difficult to rinse everything out but i really pay attention to it. I don't know why this is happening but it is really bothering me. \n\nCould this be that i am using conditioner now and never used it before? Or that i am using sulphate free shampoo which makes something build up in my hair? Because when i just used shampoo with sulphates i didn't had this problem. Or is this the way the hair should feel when using no sulphates and conditioner? Because i noticed that my hair is more wavier now then it was when i used sulphate shampoo and no conditioner? Or is it hard water build up? Because i have moderatly hard water.\n\nMy hair is not really curly (more wavy actually) but i didn't know where to post this question and i have been reading this reddit for the past few days and i am really impressed by the knowledge of this subreddit. And you also use this sulphate / silicon free approach to get healthy looking hair. :) But if this is not the right sub to ask this could you please redirect me?

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a bit of a haircare/hair science newbie, and I searched the sub and combed through the wiki to try to figure this out myself, but I’m still at a loss, probably because I just don’t quite understand which haircare ingredients do what. Anyway, all this to say that I’m sorry if this has been asked or covered before. I just couldn’t find it on my own. If there are any posts you think I should refer to, please link it below!\n\n\nI recently tried the Pureology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner set, and after rinsing out the conditioner, I could immediately tell that my hair felt softer. After drying, my hair was much smoother/less frizzy, had a lot of body, and was the shiniest I’ve ever seen it. My parents, who have never commented on my hair, even said that my hair looked really healthy when we were FaceTiming. Given that the price of the products makes me want to cry, I’m hoping to get some help in figuring out what exactly is in it that my hair really loves, and I want to see if I can find those ingredients in other shampoos/conditioners. \n\n\nA little bit about my hair:\n\n\nI have thin, low porosity (I think), fine, black hair. My ends are drier and I have a very oily scalp. The oily scalp is very odd to me because I am extremely dry everywhere else on my body, but my scalp has always been oily.\n\n\nI wash and condition my hair every night, wrap in an Aquis microfiber towel for a while, remove the towel, spray It’s A 10 leave-in lite, then dry my hair with a hairdryer. I’ve tried not washing my hair every day, but it just gets too oily by the second day and my hair gets stringy and looks limp. Sometimes I will use dry shampoo, but I find that it just feels like there’s a lot of gunk in my hair and I break out on my scalp. \n\n\nFor the past couple of years, I’ve used Matrix Biolage Ultra Hydrasource Shampoo and ultra Hydrasource conditioning balm. I’ve also used the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo/conditioner set on the days I have to wash dry shampoo out of my hair because I feel like the tea tree helps with the breakouts. For deep conditioning, I used the briogeo don’t despair repair conditioning mask, but honestly that just felt like an everyday conditioner to me, and I would mix that in with the tea tree conditioner because I didn’t feel like the Paul Mitchell one did anything for my hair. Currently I’m using the living proof restore hair mask in the same way. When I ran out of the matrix set, I switched over to the Bondi Boost hair growth shampoo and conditioner because when I finally was able to get a hair cut, my hairdresser told me that I had lost a lot of hair. Although I think it was due to stress and the fact that I couldn’t go get my hair done because COVID and I live in a different state than my home state for grad school, so my hair got really long and I don’t think it was very healthy (but it also looked really good after the Pureology set, and it looks even better now that I got a haircut and feel like my hair is a bit healthier than before). The Pureology was used here and there throughout my time with these aforementioned products, mainly because I was trying to make the product last longer, but each time I use it, I notice an immediate difference. \n\n\nPlease let me know if there’s any other info you need to know about my hair, and thanks in advance for reading this post and for any insight you might have for me!\n\n\nShampoo Infredients:\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Glycol Distearate, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Glycereth-26, Panthenol, Parfum/Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Ppg-5-Ceteth-20, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyquaternium-10, Amodimethicone, Peg-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Carbomer, C11-15 Pareth-7, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Laureth-9, Glycerin, C12-13 Pareth-23, Benzyl Alcohol, C12-13 Pareth-3, Trideceth-12, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Magnesium Nitrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Isopropyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Melanin, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Pentylene Glycol, Bht, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nConditioner Ingredients\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Benzoic Acid, Trideceth-6, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Potassium Hydroxide, Caramel, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, CI 15985/Yellow 6, CI 14700/Red 4, BHT, Melanin, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

Soaps and shampoos can sometimes trigger these symptoms as well, but I’ve FINALLY found a shampoo that doesn’t do those things and I truly love its scent. Because of my unfortunate sensitivities, it’s difficult to find things like scented candles or room air fresheners that don’t trigger some kind of adverse response. I would LOVE to know what comprises their “Fragrance (parfum)” as listed on their Ingredients list. It would be wonderful to be one of those people whose house smells of a lovely candle and be able to breathe comfortably in the surrounding aroma. I might even find a perfume I could wear. (I can handle wearing a touch of D&G Light Blue for a couple hours before the pinch of a headache begins.)\n\nI’ve written to and emailed the company asking about their “Exclusive Agadir aroma,” but have not gotten any reply or response. I’d guess it’s a secret proprietary formula or something, but I’d be happy to learn even one of the scents Agadir uses for their aroma. I’m reading more about the argania spinosa kernel oil, but the ingredients list still contains that elusive “Fragrance (parfum).”\n\nThanks to any and all who took the time to look at this post and I’d like to express sincere gratitude to anybody that might be able to shine some light on this. I don’t even know the name(s) of my favorite scent!\n\nIngredients :\nPurified Water (aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Polysorbate-20, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan Oil), Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (parfum), Benzyl Benzoate\n\n[Agadir Argan Oil Daily Volumizing Shampoo Website](https://agadirint.com/collections/gold-line/products/agadir-argan-oil-daily-volumizing-shampoo)\n\nIf this belongs elsewhere, please let me know!

Argan oil has a very very mild smell like most carrier oils. \n\nRather than think in terms of ingredients or trying to find ingredients, try smelling it to figure out how it smells or what it smells like to you.  You could also ask the company how they intended this product to smell. You're more likely to get an answer to that rather than a list of ingredients because that's proprietary obviously. Hope you get some feedback from the company.  Once you have some idea, post in the Recommend Me a Fragrance thread pinned to the top of the feed (sort feed by HOT).",

I have straightened my hair almost every day since I was about 13, and have no idea how to take care of my natural hair. (Don't know if natural hair is the correct word as I am white, please tell me if there is a better term) . I can't keep straightening my hair, even though I use heat protection sprays and try to be gentle. CG looks very promising, but I have some major inconveniences when it comes to actually doing it. I will try to keep it short, but I have a lot on my mind.\n\n**Current state:**\n\nIn these \\~quarantine times\\~ I've managed to keep away from the straightening iron. I have used the repairing shampoo and conditioner from By Veira, which I thought was CG approved (no silicones or sulphates), but both contain alcohol and the shampoo contains  sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate and sodium lauryl sulfoacetate. My hair has gotten used to more infrequent washing, so I wash my hair 2-3 times a week. My waves are definitely more prominent and less frizzy than before.\n\n**I straightened my hair from an early age**\n\n* My mom makes rude remarks about my unstraightened hair, and got mad if I went out \"unkempt\" or \"not trying to do something about my hair\"\n* Having straight hair is so ingrained in me now, I can go out without makeup (and my skin is fullll of acne scars), but I won't go outside with my unstraightened hair (unless I have a ponytail). I want to be comfortable with curly hair, but I feel so ugly with it :(\n* I know I had wavy hair before, with occasional loose ringlets\n* Whenever I shower and let it air dry/sleep with damp hair, it ends up looking somewhere between second movie Hermione Granger and Hagrid\n\n**I'm from Scandinavia**\n\n* There are so many product tips here, but 99.9% aren't available, or they are way out of my price range. \n* There are barely *any* CG approved products\n* I don't live in a major city, so I can't try specialty stores\n* I want to try the Curl Girl brand that Normal has, but it's brand new and not reviewed, and even though it's a fair price it's too much if it doesn't work.\n\n**I was a competitive swimmer from 6-18, and swim as often as I can now (about once a week)**\n\n* Obv chlorine and silicone cap wear and tear on my hair\n* My training schedule then and now is late evening (after 8 pm), and I have to sleep with wet hair\n\n**My job requires me to have my hair up, both hygiene and convenience reasons**\n\n* Also I love wearing ponytails, but I have to brush my hair to properly make one and it makes my hair bushy\n\n**I have ADHD**\n\n* Again, I love wearing ponytails. If I keep my hair down I constantly fidget with it and run my fingers over my scalp which makes my hair greasy faster\n\n**tl;dr:** limited access to products, love ponytails, swim regularly, adhd hair fidgeter, student budget, hair dysmorphia i guess?",

However longer alkyl chains give better foam stability ([source using SLS as an example](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927775722021495)).\n\nThe coconut oil-derived surfactants have a mixture of C8-C10, while the lauryl group (C12) has a longer chain length and will have a more stable foam. \n\nBetween SLI and SLEI, the ethoxylated portion reduces foaming ability ever so slightly because it the ethoxylated groups lead to a slightly higher surface tension compared to non-ethixylated versions. This is probably because of how the ethoxylated groups affect packing at the air-water interface. \n\nSo SLI will have the best foam stability. You can also use enhancers of foaming that reduce surface tension while still be gentle (like CAPB) creating mixed micelles. Not all surfactants do this well, so play around and see what you like. \n\nI do think a few percent SLI in a shampoo does a lot for foaming while still leaving a alkylglucosides formula rather mild. I usually don't use more than 10 wt% in a AG-derived formula.",

    "body": "I struggle so much with my hair. It is very fine, but there is plenty of it. It is wavy and prone to breakage and frizz. It is color treated (because I have some greys) and I rarely use heat to style. The one upside it that is tends to be very soft (except when I pick the wrong product and dry it out). \n\nI am getting so turned around and confused with all the hair care advice I read. I am currently using [HairStory](https://www.hairstory.com/products/new-wash/) and it is going alright, but that s\\*&t is expensive. I made the mistake of using a leave-in that came in an Ipsy bag ( [FoxyBae Magic Daily Leave In Hair Mask - 12-in-1](https://www.foxybae.com/products/12-in-1-magic-daily-leave-in-hair-mask)). It was good the first time I used it but now my hair is feeling a bit grubby (so I guess I need to use a clarifying shampoo). I like to wash my hair ever other day, but on day two I always have to wear it in a ponytail. I'm tired of fighting it every day and spending a fortune on stuff that never seems to work. \n\nI have tried CG method, untold products for decades, products for curly hair, products for wavy hair, products for fine hair...). If I don't wash my hair frequently my scalp itches, so I have never managed more than three days. It takes my hair a long time to air dry, so I hate washing it because I have to go to work with wet hair or sleep with wet hair. \n\nI just want my hair to be moisture/protein balanced and not weighed down. I don't like complicated hair routines and prefer to use little or no product outside of shampoo and conditioner. I occasionally use [L'anza Bounce Up Spray](https://www.ulta.com/healing-oil-bounce-up-spray?productId=xlsImpprod18041073) and that seems to be magic. I have [Olaplex](https://olaplex.com/) 3 and it worked great the first time and has had diminishing returns since. I also have Olaplex 6 and it feels heavy in my hair. \n\nI tried that hair in water test and it never sunk despite leaving it in the cup for over an hour; however, I hear that this test may not be that helpful. Again, I get conflicting information. \n\nI am currently eyeing the [Verb Ghost line](https://www.verbproducts.com/products/smooth-shine-duo?variant=32294608240729). Ingredients below. Should I try that one? Or is there something else that could work for me? Please help.

I’ve use the shampoo and conditioner for about six months, and I’ve tried the hair mask and oil from the same line. The Ghost hair mask is very light, so if you felt weighed down by others, definitely try that one. I use the oil sparingly at night any time my ends feel dry and I always wake up to super soft hair. I bought one of those [shampoo brush things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZDXFL6?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) for a scalp massage while shampooing and that feels nice and I think my roots are less greasy for longer.

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This baby shampoo has gentle cleansing agents like Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate and Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate. However, the presence of Pyrithione Zinc signifies the shampoo is aimed at treating specific scalp conditions, such as cradle cap. It's important to use this only under a healthcare professional's advice for infants. The formula also includes Apple Extract, known for its antioxidant properties, and Panthenol, beneficial for skin hydration. Despite the inclusion of Phenoxyethanol as a preservative, it's typically safe in concentrations below 1%. Always perform a patch test to monitor possible allergic reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Pyrithione Zinc, Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Acrylates Copolymer, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Hydroxide\n   * Sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda or lye, is a strong alkaline compound that is sometimes used in the manufacturing process of personal care products, including baby lotions. It is used to adjust the pH of the formulation to ensure stability and efficacy. However, it is important to note that sodium hydroxide itself is not typically listed as an active ingredient in baby lotions, but rather used in very small amounts for pH adjustment purposes.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Sodium hydroxide, if present in higher concentrations, can cause skin irritation in some individuals. This may manifest as redness, itching, burning sensation, or rash. It is important to discontinue use if your baby experiences any of these symptoms and consult a healthcare professional.\n      * Eye Irritation: Direct contact of baby lotion containing sodium hydroxide with the eyes can cause mild to moderate eye irritation. It is crucial to avoid contact with the eyes and rinse thoroughly with water if accidental exposure occurs.\n      * Chemical Burns: Sodium hydroxide is a caustic substance and can cause chemical burns if used undiluted or in high concentrations. However, in properly formulated baby lotions, the concentration of sodium hydroxide is typically low and safe for use.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Zinc Pyrithione\n   * Zinc Pyrithione is a coordination complex of zinc that's primarily used as an antifungal and antibacterial agent. It's often found in products like dandruff shampoos, certain types of soap, and some skin care products due to its ability to treat seborrheic dermatitis, an inflammatory skin disorder that causes flaky, scaly patches on the skin. In baby shampoo, Zinc Pyrithione would likely be used to help manage cradle cap (a form of seborrheic dermatitis in infants) or other minor skin conditions. However, it's worth noting that not all baby shampoos will contain this ingredient, as its use will depend on the specific formulation of the product.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some individuals may experience skin irritation, including redness, itching, or a rash, particularly if they have sensitive skin.\n      * Allergic Reactions: While rare, allergic reactions can occur. Symptoms might include severe redness, itching, hives, or swelling. In extreme cases, difficulty breathing could occur, which requires immediate medical attention.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product with Zinc Pyrithione gets into the eyes, it can cause redness, watering, and irritation.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 6\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Phenoxyethanol\n   * Phenoxyethanol is used as a preservative in cosmetic products and also as a stabilizer in perfumes and soaps. Exposure to phenoxyethanol has been linked to reactions ranging from eczema to severe, life-threatening allergic reactions. Infant oral exposure to phenoxyethanol can acutely affect nervous system function.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some cases, phenoxyethanol can cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction, presenting as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin and may be more susceptible to such reactions.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though less common, some people may experience an allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol, which could result in symptoms like hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Eczema: It is also a common allergic reaction to skin exposure of products containing one percent or more phenoxyethanol. Reactions only occur in the area of application and eczema subsides after avoidance of the product causing irritation.\n      * Acute nervous system effects (infants): In 2008, the FDA warned consumers not to purchase Mommy’s Bliss Nipple Cream. Phenoxyethanol, found in the cream, was depressing the central nervous system and causing vomiting and diarrhea in breast feeding infants. Symptoms of a depressed nervous system include a decrease in infant’s appetite, difficulty waking the infant, limpness of extremities and change in skin color. There is no known health risk to the mother.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

I feel like I have zero way to predict whether my scalp will like a shampoo or not; some with supposedly \"harsher\" ingredients work great for me and others that are \"gentler\" make me super dry and itchy! I have to stick to low-poo because my low-porosity, medium-thickness 2C hair gets weighed down really easily. I desperately want to experiment with new shampoos but I have no way of narrowing down which ones might work for me!!\n\nHere are some of the products I've tried, how my scalp liked them, and their ingredients.\n\nTHE BODY SHOP GINGER SHAMPOO - Somehow? this is the nicest of all the shampoos I've ever tried on my scalp?? I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm. I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky.

Acid exfoliants need time to penetrate the skin in order to do their work.\n\nTo purchase acid exfoliants in the UK, you can try Paula's Choice UK (expensive), Forever Young Active Solutions (cheap), or Nip + Fab (mid-range), which is available in Boots and Superdrug.\n\nI use Korean products as I find they suit my skin best and are pretty good value: CosRX Blackhead Power Liquid for BHA and Whitehead Power Liquid for AHA (this is quite strong and not necessarily for beginners). They are around £7 each for around 3 months of product. There's a lot of info over on /r/AsianBeauty.\n\nIf you worry about sunlight, do you wear a high factor sunscreen every day? This is important regardless, but if you do start using acids it's absolutely essential. Asian sunscreens are believed to be higher quality in terms of sun protection, and sit more nicely on the skin than Western products. I use Biore Watery Essence, which is SPF 50+ PA++++, and you can buy it from Ebay and Amazon UK for around £7-10.\n\nPIH (acne scarring) can potentially be helped to heal with a Vitamin C serum, but honestly, sunscreen is your bff in the fight against scarring, at least to start with.\n\nWe sound like similar skin types, so feel free to ask me anything else! This is my routine, which is keeping my hormonal acne under control.

I used the All Bright serum (see AHA/ BHA mega review in the sidebar) and was underwhelmed.\n\nFurthermore the UV index is pretty low at present, low enough not to be useful for vitamin D production in the skin. I would be more concerned about getting enough bioavailable vitamin D in your diet since that and the long chain omega-3s also in oily fish are really important for skin health. Experts recommend up to four servings of oily fish a week.\n\nConsult your family doctor about the breakouts because the most effective acne fighting actives are on prescription. Some of those may necessitate vigilant use of a broad spectrum sunscreen. Do also check out our ingredients Wiki, particularly the entries on vitamin A, vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate) and niacinamide.",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI've been following a simple routine consistently for about a month, just cleanser and toner w/salicylic acid, added a moisturiser for about a week, then switched that and added a spot-on acne gel. Just wondering if some products of the ones I have are better than others, if some might be a bad idea and need switching, and what to be looking to add in. Maybe some from The Ordinary? I understand I need to go slowly, so if you tell me 'wait a few weeks, then add [product]', I can do that. I am, Ok, tempted to try some kind of drastic acid peel-all-the-skin-dramatically-off treatment in the vague hope of getting to start with a cleaner slate, but I guess that's probably not wise?\n\nIf there's anything I should do with spacing/timing and order to use things in, please suggest that too, I'm just layering products. Should I still be using everything first if I'm going to put make-up on in the morning too?\n\nAge: 33\n\nSkin type: Combination I think, but so oily on face it might as well just be oily\n\nConcerns: Acne, probs. hormonal, suspect seb derm which may be related issue (have salicylic acid shampoo). Noticeable sebaceous filaments. Visible oiliness. Some redness. One very fine line, may be vertical frown line, may be a scar.\n\nMake-up: Only recently got any again, have rarely used it.\n\nSuitability requirements: Vegan\n\nOther notes: I quit using products before as a teen because it wasn't working. The only thing that has ever made a significant ongoing difference, as a happy and unexpected side-effect, was switching to a dairy-free diet. I really don't like that one fine line due to the placement. I get that 'pores are normal', but the visibility makes me want to do something drastic involving strong acid. I have nerve damage so anything I use is prone to feel tingly/burny, making it hard to use that as a gauge, but my skin doesn't actually seem very sensitive in terms of real reactions to products. Not sure it absorbs products well. I'm not using SPF at present because I'm most often housebound currently, but feel free to advise on how to add this in for times that's not the case.\n\nCurrent products:\n\n**Cleansers**\n\nPrevise Dermapothecary Purify Botanic Wash\n\nI've liked this. Noticeable improvement just from using it and the toner dabbed on the worst problem areas, it seems to have fixed the flaky itchy skin under my eyebrows, skin is softer. Possibly pretty much anything would've had the same result, admittedly. The instructions don't actually say to wash it off with water, so, eh...?\nDid not seem to help with removing new mascara, as it dawned on me that I was not actually sure *how* to remove mascara.\n\nIngredients: Water, Algae Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Xantham Gum, Pentylene Glycol, Helianthus Anthus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Organic Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Oil, Organic Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Oil, Diglycerin, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Citric Acid, Silver Citrate\n\nSukin Clearing Facial Wash\n\nNot yet used.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Punica Granatum Fruit Extract (Pomegranate), Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Glycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Toner/Salicylic Acid**\n\nSukin Pore Perfecting Toner\n\nSmells satisfyingly medicinal, but results have varied from 'I'm almost sure this is helping' to 'I'm not sure this is doing a darn thing', which is possibly just usual breakout fluctuation.\n\nIngedients: Water(Aqua), Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract(Quince), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(Green Tea/White Tea), Zingiber Officinale(Ginger)Root Extract, Mentha Piperita(Peppermint)Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia(Lavender)Oil, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Salicylic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Oleate, Sodium Surfactin, Sorbic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\nSukin Spot-Banishing Gel\n\nI was hoping this would have the same kind of near-instant spot drying-out effect I remembered from the gels I'd used as a teen, but while it might be a little better, eh, not really, so far. Think might be a little drying.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Salicylic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Zingiber Officinal (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract (Chamomile), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Sorbic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Moisturiser**\n\nDr Organic Rose Otto Day Cream\n\nWas a little burny.

        "body": "It definitely sounds like you’ve been taking the right approach so well done for being patient (it took me YEARS of throwing new harsh stuff at my face every other week to realise a slow and simple routine worked better for me!)\n\nI’m not super knowledgable and unfortunately I have zero experience of the brands you’ve mentioned, but one thing I’ve noticed from the ingredients is that the Sukin products have a lot of botanical oils and in general the products all have a lot of ingredients. Have you tried simpler “dermatology” brands like Avene, La Roche Posay, Cerave, Cetaphil or at a cheaper high street level Simple? It may be worth reading up about some of these, they’re a staple on subs like this and obviously not everything works for every person but a lot of people see results when using their targeted but quite sensitively formulated products. For example the Sukin moisturiser says it’s oil free, which sounds great if you have oily skin, but there are a lot of plant extracts which can be quite reactive on some skin so could be less than ideal. Also I know it sounds strange but being oily is often to do with being dehydrated and your skin overcompensating, so you don’t always have to shy away from rich moisturising products - I didn’t use moisturiser at all for years because I thought it would make oily ness worse, but the moment I started to use a plain moisturiser my skin (including spots) was so much happier!\n\nI am waffling now, basically I don’t have very wise or specific words for you but you are definitely taking the right approach but maybe products from different brands or with simpler formulas might help? It’s such a pain figuring this stuff out, I wish you luck!",

    "body": "I did a search and wasn't really able to answer this question satisfactorily so I was hoping to get some thoughts.\n\nI'm noticing that some shampoos being recommended here as \"low-poos\" and others as \"clarifying\" both seem to have some ingredients that  in the \"stronger cleanser\" category (according to curlscan.com) but are not sulfates. For instance, I bought NYM Matcha and Apple Blossom shampoo a couple weeks ago as a low-poo, and generally like it, and it contains the \"stronger cleanser\" sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate. I just realized this week that I had unwittingly used a product with silicones and thus was considering clarifying and was doing some research on good clarifying shampoos since I didn't care for the sulfate shampoo I'd used before. I found several recommendations that I was interested in, including Kinky Curly Come Clean, Trader Joe's Tea Tree Shampoo, and Noughty's Detox Dynamo... and none of them have sulfates either, but some other \"stronger cleanser.\" \n\nSo... what's the difference? Should I just not worry about getting a separate clarifying shampoo? Does adding an ACV rinse accomplish the same thing?? I've done 50:50 ACV in the past so I tolerate it fairly well. Or do I need to be targeting a shampoo that for sure has sulfates to get the full clarifying effect? It seems like the shampoos labeled clarifying tend to have some chelating ingredient, but I don't think I have particularly hard water so I don't know if that matters much for me, but I don't know for sure. \n\nAnd I have seen Mel's video about how sulfates/silicones are not inherently bad, but I'm in the phase of trying to figure out which ingredients and methods work for me so I'm trying to be consistent with keeping silicones out of my hair for now. \n\nThanks in advance, I know that's a lot of questions and the answer seems likely to be \"just try some stuff\" but any thoughts are helpful!",

(Or maybe once, after a 3 months tan earned by surfing without sunscreen...

I feel like it could also help with my under eyes wrinkles, don't you think ? \"***, I asked.\n* ***\"Retin-A is not appropriate for inflammatory acne, and one does not put Retin-A under eyes... I'll give you differin.\"***\n* ***\"Ok... But what about anti-aging ?\" \"Just put some moisturizer under your eyes\"***\n* ***\" What about niacinamide ? \"There's no large scale study that shows strong benefits\"***\n* ***\"Hm.

(I currently use something similar) I was more thinking about going for something like that : [TOLERIANE HYDRATING GENTLE FACIAL CLEANSER](https://www.laroche-posay.us/face-and-body-skin-care/face-products/face-wash/toleriane-hydrating-gentle-facial-cleanser-3337875545778.html)\n2. The derm told me to apply differin on the pimples... Wtf ? Shouldn't I use it like other retinoids, a pea sized amount all over the face ?\n3. What about anti-aging and under eyes ? I've read some studies showed potential anti aging effects with differin, should I cross my fingers and got for it ?\n4. What about vaseline ?\n\nIt took her 10 years studying medicine, 10 minutes to confuse me. It cost me 100$... And she didn't even try to sell me hyaluronic or PRP whatever injection !\n\nJust after me, there was an old botox lady waiting. The doctor almost high fived her : Not all patients are created equals.",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: I believe this product stands as one of the top baby shampoo options available at a reasonable price. It has obtained the EWG's certification for safety compliance, containing only a single moderate hazard ingredient. While there are reports from the EWG associating Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice with potential carcinogenic risks, it's worth noting that most commercial aloe vera products, including skincare and topical applications, utilize the clear gel from within the aloe vera leaf, excluding the outer part containing aloin. Manufacturers typically employ processes that remove aloin to undetectable levels. However, parents who harbor concerns regarding the presence of Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice may opt for alternative products. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\\*, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\\*, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\\*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract\\*, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract\\*, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract\\*, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Sodium Chloride, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Dehydroacetic Acid, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid \\*Organic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\n   * Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice is widely used in skincare products, including baby shampoos, due to its soothing, hydrating, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is generally considered safe for topical use.\n   * However, it's worth noting that certain parts of the aloe vera plant contain a compound called aloin, which has been linked to potential carcinogenic effects when ingested in large amounts. Most commercial aloe vera products, including skincare products and topical applications, are made from the clear gel found inside the aloe vera leaf, not the outer part of the leaf where aloin is found. The process used to prepare aloe vera for commercial use generally removes aloin to non-detectable levels.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Aloe vera is usually soothing, but some individuals may experience skin irritation or allergic reactions, such as redness, rash, burning or itching sensations, especially with frequent use.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Rarely, some individuals may have a more severe allergic reaction to aloe vera. This could result in symptoms like swelling, severe redness, or difficulty breathing.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

This would be good for both color and curls and sufficient for cleansing unless you have a lot of buildup or certain scalp conditions. It would be a little harsher on hair than the kinky moves, but a lot of people can't cowash.\n\nIf you can't cowash, try alternating cowashing with low poo (both the curl defining and love for hue shampoos are low poos).

    "body": "Hi there! I have been transitioning into “no poo” or at least as little as I can, for a month and a half. I have very thick, wavy-curly hair almost down to my waist. \n\nMy regular routine before finding out about “no poo” was to shower every day using, sadly, a shampoo with SLS and a conditioner with silicone in it. \n\nWhen I started transitioning I bought a new hairbrush, used the SLS shampoo to strip my hair of the silicone coating conditioner and switched to Andalou Naturals which has sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate in it which I read was a much more mild version of SLS. I was taking showers using Andalou Naturals without any conditioner every other day and then transitioned to every 3 days. \n\nI found that my hair from the crown of my head to my ears was feeling very waxy and almost sticky! It was driving me nuts and was extremely hard to brush as it created lots of tangles. I don’t have hard water but I read on here that an Apple Cider Vinegar wash can help break up the waxiness. I also was experiencing very dry, almost straw-like ends, well really the bottom 7” of my hair. It was not appealing looking and didn’t feel healthy. My waves and curls were being turned into straight straw. I also read on here about using oil in hair to hydrate it. \n\nSo, since I was camping at the time and only had limited access to supplies, I started tending to my hair by adding coconut oil to my hair from my neck length down to the tips. What a game changer!! I loved the results but felt like I could do better. When I got home and had access to more supplies I started an ACV wash, diluting 1 tablespoon of homemade ACV in one cup filtered water, massaging it into my scalp and the parts of my hair that felt waxy/sticky. I then used jojoba oil on my “ends.” I’m only on my second day of the vinegar wash and jojoba oil hydration, not having used my Andalou Naturals shampoo for 7 days now! My curls and waves are BACK! There is no more waxy feeling in my hair either. I feel like it’s a win but I have some questions: \n\nHow often do people recommend using the ACV wash? I don’t want to hurt my hair doing it too much.  Have people found certain herbs they like infusing into their ACV? What herbs do you use and do they benefit your hair in different ways, other than a lovely smell of course. :) \n\nAlso, how often do folks recommend oiling their hair with jojoba oil? I don’t want to over do it. \n\nMy hope is to find a routine that works using mainly ACV wash and hydrating with oils and possibly once weekly using the Andalou Naturals shampoo. Maybe I won’t even need that in time! \n\nThanks for your help! \n",

I get really confused on this topic because I know they say not to use SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) or SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate) to minimize color fading, but I see that a lot of hair ingredients list things that sound very similar to these ingredients such as: sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate and sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, both of which are found in the ouai detox shampoo. Those ingredients are just an example, but basically like anytime I see any of the terms Sodium, Lauryl/Laureth, Sulfate, or anything that ends with -ate, on their own or in conjuction with something else in hair ingredients, I am scared that means the ingredient/product isn't color safe and will ruin my hair. Sorry if this was long, this has just been a months long frustration of mine that I'd like to figure out if I can. Any help would be appreciated!",

        "body": "Same sounding ingredients don’t necessarily have same function or chemical structure.\n\nFor example SLS is commonly said to be not colour safe but with haircare products overall formulation of the product is even more important than the absence or presence of a single ingredient. It would be possible to create as colour safe formula as possible (saying as possible as in the end even rinsing with water will fade dyed hair) with sulfates or create very deeply cleansing formula without sulfates (and some see for example that sulfonate (Olefin C14-16 Sulfonate) you mentioned as more harsh type ingredient). \n\nSulfates like SLS or SLES tend to be efficient cleansing type ingredients and they might be harsh on certain scalp types but they are also tolerated by many. Regarding sulfates in shampoos generally you might be interested to watch this (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-_3P3OGVzSA) video from Michelle Wong aka LabMuffin, a science educator and cosmetic scientist. \n\nWhat kind of colour you have, what type dye was used and what is your current care routine? Certain type dyes like e.g. direct type dyes that only more or less adhere on hair can be even easier to wash out of hair but in the end even permanent dyes do fade at some point and to certain extent.",

The living proof brand seems to be my top choice but the fragrances have a lot of extracts that give me anxiety like orange and bergamot extract. \n\nCould someone just read thru these ingredients and reassure me I can use this shampoo? Planning on relying solely on the implant soon and just really want to make sure this won’t affect it. \n\nAlso, I know this might seem irrational but I do have a therapist for my anxiety and have been doing so much better.
