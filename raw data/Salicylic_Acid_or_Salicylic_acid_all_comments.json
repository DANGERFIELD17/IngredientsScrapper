    "body": "Hi everyone! I posted this on another sub not too long ago and because of the positive reaction I wanted to share it with you all. Hope you like it.      \n      \nLittle bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n                \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My pimples reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n  \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**\n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.

Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n        \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My acne reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n   \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**   \n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.",

Took long enough! \n\nI found this routine and ditching the foundation has helped loads. \n\n- Carbon theory charcoal cleansing bar\n- The body shop camomile cleansing butter \n- The ordinary copper peptide serum \n- ROC multi correxion vitamin c serum\n- Neutrogena 0.5% salicylic acid moisturiser \n- Neutrogena 7% aha liquid exfoliant (great cheaper dupe for Paula’s Choice) \n- Cerave retinol serum once a week \n\nInstead of foundation I now use Dr Jart’s Cicapair and whatever random concealer I have with a translucent setting powder to stop the oiliness. \n\nI suffer from RBF 😂 so get regular botox for frown lines and I’m looking into co2 laser for under my eyes and an upper bleph soon. I’ve noticed my eyes in particular are looking way more tired at this age. I’ve got a really square jaw so was contemplating masseter botox but been told this can cause jowls so think I’ll avoid that one! \n\n\n",

Do you notice your face looking more blemishy as the day progresses?\n\nI have noticed that when I wake up in the morning, my face often looks much smoother and more even. Like, that peak glow, ya know? But as the day goes on, I feel like my complexion gets more uneven and any texture I have becomes more pronounced. I have combo oily skin, sensitive, mildly acne prone (mostly hormonal), so I kind of expect my skin to look a little rougher when I'm no longer peacefully sleeping after a nice PM routine. But nevertheless, I wish I could hold onto that morning niceness for longer!\n\nI am assuming this is totally natural and just the result of being a living human (much like how many people feel that their body is tighter in the morning but then as the day goes they feel more bloated from simply being a human that has to eat and drink and live). But I just hadn't seen any discussion on it and was curious if others have similar experiences.\n\nDo you feel like your skin is at its \"peak\" in the very start of your day, and then it loses that niceness throughout the day? Do you have any tips or tricks for maintaining that morning freshness for longer?\n\n(I don't really mean to force people to feel like they have to discuss routine here, this is more of a general rant/discussion, but in case it is helpful: AM Routine is wash face with just water, then use TO Moisturizing Factors and LRP Antihelios mineral sunscreen. PM Routine is wash face with LRP effaclar salicylic acid wash, exfoliate with stridex only 3x a week. On non-exfoliation nights, I use TO niacinamide after washing. Then finish with same TO moisurtizer.)\n\nEdit: Wow, so turns out I am not the only one who experiences this :) Thanks so much for all your comments!! ",

I had only one resolution this year, because rarely have I ever stuck to a resolution, and I wanted to make it INCREDIBLY easy this year. So, what was that resolution?\n\nIt was flossing.\n\nHear me out. I have flossed almost everyday this year and will continue to do the same in the future. But how did flossing cause me to get my life together? The reason is very similar to the *diderot effect.*\n\nFor those who don’t know, Diderot lived in the 1700s and was very poor. Then Catherine the Great offered to buy his library for a large sum of money (side note: she let him keep it, and just borrowed books from him). With this, he bought a new scarlet robe. He loved the robe, but soon found that all of his other possessions looked drab in comparison to it. Slowly, he began replacing things in his house with higher-end items that would better match his robe. Before long, Diderot didn’t have any money left.\n\nWhen we buy a nice item that doesn’t match other items, we will start to replace the other items. This is called the diderot effect.\n\nA similar thing happened to me, only the end result was not debt. I made the resolution to floss, and was determined to keep it. Even if I remembered after I got in bed and was about to fall asleep, I would get up and do it. I made it so there wasn’t an option, as I had already made the choice when I made the resolution. After a little over a month, I was getting the habit and didn’t dread it anymore. So, in my own eyes, I became something more, I became Someone Who Flossed™.\n\nPretty soon, my nighttime routine looked pretty drab in comparison to my newfound identity (kind of like Diderot, right?). At first, I just made sure to brush my teeth twice a day so that my hard work in flossing wasn’t undone. Then I decided to start a simple skincare routine. To do this, I happened to buy a product with salicylic acid in it that helped my acne significantly. Because of this, I got super into skincare and started a full-fledged routine by browsing [r/SkincareAddiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/) and skincare videos on YouTube. After a month, I became Someone Who Had a Skincare Routine™ as well as Someone Who Flossed™.\n\nThese became a part of my identity, but other parts of my life were looking bad in comparison. Also, in my mind, people who floss everyday and have a skincare routine not only have their life together, but are just more advanced at life. Because of this I tried reading more adult-level books, like The Shining and 1984. Then I picked up Crime and Punishment and fell in love. For the first time, I realized old classics are actually very interesting and fun, especially Russian classics. Thus, I started reading only these (and I’m still working my way through the most popular classics). As a result, I became Someone Who Reads Classics™.\n\nI think you all see the trend here. Exercise and meditation were added after I took that free Yale course, “The Science of Well Being” (which I highly recommend).\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nMaybe other people can have a similar experience, in the same way Diderot’s experience became common. If anything, you could make it your resolution to floss this upcoming year, like I did. Otherwise, pick a different, very easy resolution that you associate with people who have their lives together. Even if you want to have other resolutions, just make this one the one you don’t have a choice but to stick to. Worse comes to worse, nothing else changes but your dentist is very happy with you.\n\nI know this sounds a little gimmicky, but it really worked for me, so I wanted to share. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nTldr: The resolution was flossing. I changed everything else to become the type of person I thought someone who flosses was. It’s kind of hard to explain concisely, but it’s similar to the diderot effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm so pleasantly surprised at the number of people saying they're going to do this as well. Please feel free to comment your progress (or lack of it) on this post in the future. Also, I want to emphasize how long this process took. I only added a second habit after two full months of flossing. So, don't be discouraged by very slow progress, and you can do it!",

    "body": "Hey-Oh! So, I see some form of this question multiple times per day in various skin and personal care subs: How do I deal with my hyperpigmentation? I also asked myself this question a few years ago. See, I'm prone to freckles and a little melasma and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern, especially among people in their 30s. This started as a small post about my routine and ballooned into a massive book about hyperpigmentation. I hope it's helpful!\n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* I use the term \"brightening\" instead of \"lightening\" which is a subtle distinction. None of the ingredients or methods I recommend bleach your skin as \"lightening\" would suggest, but they can reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. \"Brightening\" tends to be a confusing term in skincare, but for the purposes of this post, I use it as a descriptor for anything that helps prevent or reduce melanin in hyperpigmented skin.\n* I will use the term \"hyperpigmentation\" ad nauseam as a catch-all term for excess pigmentation in the skin including freckles, melasma, PIH and dark spots. This does not encompass moles which are different. This is also different from redness, which is a whole other post.\n* Speaking about hyperpigmentation requires some sensitivity to very real issues around it including cultural implications. This post is not intended to moralize hyperpigmentation nor is it intended to alienate the normal melaninization of skin across various tones. Hyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production on the skin in the form of spots that are darker than the surrounding skin. It's not bad or wrong, nor does it speak to anyone not \"doing a good enough job\" of taking care of themselves.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't have any products I've formulated myself to promote. \n\nThis is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:hyperpigmentation. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need:\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Hyperpigmentation\n2. What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n3. How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n4. How to Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n5. Body Hyperpigmentation\n6. Nuclear Options\n\nLet's get to it!\n\n# Types of Hyperpigmentation\n\nHyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production in the skin, but it can actually take a couple different forms. Knowing the type of hyperpigmentation you're experiencing is key to understanding if and how it can be treated.\n\n**Freckles:** Freckles are incredibly common, especially for people with lighter skin tones. They are small, brown or reddish-brown dots often clustered on the skin. They develop on the surface and are not raised bumps. Freckles can appear anywhere on the body but are common on the face. Freckles are permanent, but the color, contrast and severity can vary and be tempered.\n\n**Melasma:** Melasma appears as dark patches or splotches around the face, though usually found on the forehead, upper lip, and high on the cheeks. Melasma forms deeper in the skin and appears more amorphous than freckles, moles, or age spots. It can create a “muddy” appearance and is very common among pregnant and postpartum women due to hormonal factors. But it can literally happen to anyone and anywhere on the body.\n\n**Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH):** Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) occurs when damaged skin forms melanin during the healing process leaving dark spots. This is common after acne, injuries, eczema, burns, and other trauma to the skin. Exposure to UV rays during healing can make PIH worse. Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) is similar, but leaves pink or red marks on the skin as a result of damage to the capillaries from injury or inflammation. Basically, when skin is compromised by injury, as part of the immune response cells will begin to generate melanin in an attempt to prevent further damage from UV exposure, so what will happen is the wound/legion/blemish will heal but the pigmented skin remains.\n\n**Age Spots:** This is kind of a forgotten form of hyperpigmentation. Sun spots, also referred to as liver spots, and solar lentigines are large spots/patches of dark skin with distinct borders. They vary in color from light brown to almost black. They develop on the surface of the skin usually later in life, but reflect damage that often occurred from improper sun protection at a younger age. They can appear on the face, neck, chest, hands, and arms, usually on areas that had UV exposure. For many people, they can begin to appear in your 30s or 40s.\n\n# What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of hyperpigmentation. Generally, it forms as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Everyone is unique, but these are some of the most common causes of hyperpigmentation and dark spots:\n\n**Genetics** can play a role in the development of hyperpigmentation and dark spots in several ways:\n\n* **Melanin production:** Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount of melanin produced and distributed in the skin is largely determined by genetics. People with a greater genetic predisposition to melanin production in their skin are more likely to experience hyperpigmentation and dark spots as a result of sun exposure, hormonal changes, and other factors. People with darker skin are also more prone to melanin production in the form of hyperpigmentation.\n* **Genetic anomalies:** Certain genetic anomalies, such as oculocutaneous albinism, can affect melanin production and distribution in the skin, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n* **Family history:** If you have a family history of hyperpigmentation or dark spots, you may be more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\n* **Enzymes and genes:** The enzymes that control melanin production and distribution are regulated by specific genes. Variations in these genes can impact melanin production, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n\n**Sun (UV) Exposure.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, UV exposure is the leading environmental cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. It acts as a natural sunscreen (but don't treat it like natural sunscreen!!! This isn't the point of the exercise), absorbing UV radiation to protect the skin from damage.\n\nWhen the skin is exposed to UV radiation, the melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in the skin go into overdrive, producing more melanin to protect the skin from further damage. This increased melanin production can result in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation on the skin.\n\n**Hormones.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, hormones and hormonal sensitivity is a leading internal cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots.\n\nOne of the most well-known examples of hormonal hyperpigmentation is melasma, a condition characterized by dark, amorphous patches on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. Melasma is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, hormonal therapy, or birth control pill use. The hormonal changes can stimulate an increase in melanin production, resulting in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation. This can happen irrespective of UV exposure, though the sun does exacerbate it.\n\nHormones can also affect melanin production by altering the skin's metabolism and pigmentation pathways. For example, high levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands during stress, can trigger an increase in melanin production, resulting in hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Inflammation, Injury & Trauma** to the skin can result in hyperpigmentation by triggering an increase in melanin production. When the skin is inflamed or injured, it triggers a response from the body's immune system, which can stimulate an increase in melanin production as a protective measure.\n\nFor example, acne breakouts or other skin injuries can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which is characterized by dark spots or areas of discoloration on the skin. The dark spots are a result of an increase in melanin production in the affected area, which occurs in response to the inflammation or injury. In addition to acne and other skin injuries, other conditions that can result in PIH include eczema, psoriasis, and insect bites.\n\n**Medication Side Effects.** Certain medications can cause hyperpigmentation on the skin. Medications that can cause hyperpigmentation include:\n\n* **Tetracycline antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline, can cause discoloration of the skin and teeth when taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Chemotherapy drugs:** Certain chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, can cause hyperpigmentation, especially in areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun.\n* **Hormonal medications:** Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills and estrogen replacements, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if they are taken for an extended period of time.\n* **Antimalarial drugs:** Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Isotretinoin** aka accutane when taken for acne can cause hyperpigmentation due to the increase of cell turnover and exposing delicate new skin cells to UV rays before they have shored up.\n\nIf using these medications is necessary for your livelihood, it is not recommended to stop their use without the recommendation of your doctor.\n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n\nWhen looking for skin care products to treat and prevent hyperpigmentation and dark spots, it's important to look for ingredients that can help encourage cell turnover, curb melanin production, and block harmful UV rays. A lot of these things overlap with treatments for other conditions like acne and general anti-aging, but I've noted ones that specifically work on the mechanisms controlling melanin production. Now, this is an extensive list, but I know it doesn't have everything. I've included the ingredients that had the most compelling evidence and/or worked the best for me or people at my practice. But it's also not necessarily a shopping list. You don't have to have all of these things to treat hyperpigmentation, but I'll get to that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets hyperpigmentation based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include:\n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat hyperpigmentation by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help fade dark spots and improve overall skin tone by replacing pigmented skin cells at the surface. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen hyperpigmentation if you're not vigilant about sun protection and avoidance. Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms.\n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. UV exposure is one of the biggest causes of fine hyperpigmentation and wrinkles so adequate protection is essential. I know I'm not winning any science awards for this declaration, but a lot of people who struggle with hyperpigmentation aren't adequately protecting themselves from the sun. But you also have to be kind of realistic. Even with perfect protection and avoidance, sometimes your hyperpigmentation will still flare. This happens during the summer for a lot of people and something even I grapple with. The key is to do your best and SPF actually works well with numerous other ingredients (like the ones listed below) to help solve that problem.\n\n**Arbutin** is a Tyrosinase Inhibitor that blocks melanin production. Arbutin, or the synthesized version called alpha arbutin, is a favorite brightening ingredient because it's a slow-release derivative of hydroquinone that inhibits melanin production. This results in both healing and prevention of dark spots, especially when paired with topical acids. It metabolizes on the skin into hydroquinone which is super effective for hyperpigmentation while being a less controversial and hard-to-come-by ingredient than pure hydroquinone. More on hydroquinone in part 6.\n\n**Tranexamic acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. This was first used in wound care and it was found to have profound effects on hyperpigmentation. Although it's an acid, it's not a chemical exfoliant, kinda like how hyaluronic acid is not a chemical exfoliant. The exact mechanism by which tranexamic acid works to reduce hyperpigmentation is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by reducing inflammation by blocking plasmin which contributes to melanin production when unchecked. It is particularly effective in treating melasma and one of my personal favorite ingredients.\n\n**Kojic Acid** is *another* Tyrosinase Inhibitor. Kojic acid is a natural skin brightener that is derived from various fungi. Kojic acid can also help to exfoliate because it's a slight chemical exfoliant, which can remove dead skin cells that contribute to hyperpigmentation and improve overall appearance. But it does both things: block melanin production and turn skin cells over.\n\n**Azelaic Acid** has a lot of things going for it that can help with hyperpigmentation. It's an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic that disrupts melanin production. Azelaic acid works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin like those other tyrosinase inhibitors. In addition, azelaic acid also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which help to improve the overall health and appearance of the skin by reducing melanin production as a result of injury or inflammation. It's also an anti-acne ingredient that can address the root cause of PIH by reducing acne on the skin. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths.\n\n**Niacinamide** is another one that directly and indirectly addresses hyperpigmentation. It's a skin soother that decreases inflammation and it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne which can curb PIH. It actually took me a little while to figure out that this was another solid hyperpigmentation treatment for these reasons because I used to look at it as being more of an acne treatment. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that works by inhibiting the transfer of pigment within the skin, which can help to reduce the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone. So while it doesn't block tyrosinase, it prevents transfer of pigmented skin cells to the surface.\n\n**Vitamin C aka L-ascorbic acid** is an antioxidant that fights free radical damage. It treats and prevents hyperpigmentation in three ways. First, it reduces free radical damage from UV exposure which helps increase the effectiveness of SPF when worn together. Second, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor that blocks melanin production. And finally, vitamin C encourages skin cell turnover. The key is finding a nice stable version of it.\n\n**Glycolic and Lactic Acid.** Since this list is getting long I am going to group these together. Glycolic Acid is a water-soluble alpha hydroxy acid that penetrates into the pores to treat pigmentation by providing general exfoliation and resurfacing of the skin. The result is improvements in dark spots, texture and other signs of aging. Lactic Acid is also an AHA but with a slightly larger molecular size than glycolic acid so it doesn't penetrate as deep and acts more as a surface exfoliant. As a result it provides more gentle exfoliation to buff away surface pigmentation with an added benefit of acting as a humectant to seal moisture into the skin.\n\n**Licorice Extract** is a plant extract that inhibits melanin production. Licorice root extract contains a compound called glabridin, which has been shown to have skin brightening effects as, you guessed it, a tyrosinase inhibitor. In addition, licorice root extract also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and inflammation associated with hyperpigmentation. I'm seeing more and more of this pop up in skin care.\n\n**Soy Proteins** are another plant extract that inhibits melanin production. They contain compounds known as isoflavones, which have been shown to help reduce the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the skin. Additionally, soy proteins have antioxidant properties that can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation.\n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n\nThis is adapted from numerous comments, posts and DMs I've written on the topic and also comprises a large portion of my own personal routine and routines we recommend to patients. This is a generalist routine meaning it targets all the forms of hyperpigmentation I've mentioned; freckles, melasma, PIH, and age spots though it can be tweaked to address these individually more specifically. This is really my jumping off point for people to get a good idea of what they can achieve as a baseline with OTC ingredients before fine tuning or enlisting the help of a dermatologist. For a lot of people, this is enough to fully resolve, but even if it gets you part of the way there, this should give you a good idea of reactivity.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n* Freckles cannot ever be 100% eradicated. You can however reduce their appearance and prevent them from getting darker. It's important to have realistic goals and understand that sometimes our genetics will overrule any routine we have.\n* This routine and any hyperpigmentation routine will not address moles. Moles are a totally different thing that can only be eradicated through removal by a medical practitioner. Moles can be raised or not, but no amount of topicals will get rid of them.\n* Melasma is a beast. Sometimes it can be treated with OTC topicals, sometimes it requires prescription strength topicals like hydroquinone, sometimes you need in-office procedures like fractal lasers or IPL. Again, this routine is a jumping off point to see what you can accomplish at home before going down that road (and more on that at the bottom in part 6).\n* You'll notice I don't mention products with all the ingredients I listed above. This is because the more you put on your face, the greater your risk of causing irritation. Again, you can adjust and tweak by switching out products with these ingredients or add/subtract as it suits your personal needs.\n* If you're struggling with hyperpigmentation while pregnant or breastfeeding, these recommendations may need to be paused.\n\nAlright, let's get to it!\n\n**AM routine -- The Goal: Heal, Protect, and Prevent. In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n* Azelaic acid\n* Alpha Arbutin\n* Vitamin C serum\n* Moisturizer\n* SPF\n\nThe combo of C+AZ+AA+SPF is an absolute powerhouse for healing existing hyperpigmentation and preventing new hyperpigmentation from forming. It makes your SPF more effective, it inhibits the production of melanin from UV exposure (not your natural melanin production though), and it speeds cell turnover with dual antioxidant action and gentle chemical exfoliation. The result is brighter skin in a few months of consistent use.\n\n**For Azelaic Acid**, this is the ingredient for serious treatment. It's considered one of the most effective ways to reverse melasma aka serious hyperpigmentation short of hydroquinone -- which is both controversial and hard to get. It brings a little bit of exfoliation to the table in addition to inhibiting UV melanin production, but it also has a slight antiseptic property which can help with acne. Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. I get about 6 months out of a tube and a little bit goes a long way.\n\n**For Alpha Arbutin**, the Ordinary's formulation is pretty solid. I prefer the Ordinary's AA 2% + HA as opposed to their AA 2% + Ascorbic Acid 8% as I don't believe the quality and stability of their Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is great. That's why I opt for a separate Vitamin C serum step. But the AA + HA also has a little bit of lactic acid in it which provides some gentle exfoliation and encourages AA deeper into the skin where it's more effective. Lactic acid is mild enough that it's safe for use in a morning routine, but you still want to protect with SPF. There are a couple AA products floating around but I think TO's product is probably the best, most straightforward one. Alpha Arbutin metabolizes into hydroquinone on the skin so is basically one of the best OTC pigment correctors you can get.\n\n**For Vitamin C,** the gold standard really is Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. This is stupid expensive though so I’m going to suggest Timeless Vitamin C. I like that it comes in an airless pump that prevents oxidation over time. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that increases the rate of skin cell turnover bringing forward new, skin cells while simultaneously improving the effects of SPF. It's a great foundation for a fix.\n\nThese ingredients can be layered on one right after the other then topped with your **moisturizer** (I like a basic one like cetaphil daily lotion), then topped with your **SPF**. The SPF I would recommend is Canmake UV mermaid gel in clear as this will not leave a white cast on your skin and it’s generally a very elegant SPF. It's SPF 50 which means it gives really good protection, but there are numerous SPFs you can try. I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Biore Aqua Rich (another Japanese brand), Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD.\n\nOf all the products I’ve tried that could act as a stand-in for vitamin c, azelaic acid, and alpha arbutin, there’s one Japanese serum from Hada Labo called “whitening lotion” which has had the biggest impact on my hyperpigmentation in a single product of anything I’ve tried. This might be a little too effective though, I actually find that it washed me out within the first 2 weeks of twice daily use, so now I only use it in the morning. And I’m not a fan of the translation… which is a direct but mistranslation. It’s not a bleaching lotion, it also relies on a form of vitamin C and tranexamic acid to brighten skin. But it's a really interesting to try if you wanted a simplified morning routine in which case I would apply this, then your moisturizer, then your SPF.\n\n**PM routine -- The Goal: Renew and Reveal. In order of application:**\n\n* Cleanse\n* Buffer\n* Tranexamic acid and exfoliant OR retinoid\\*\\*\n* Moisturize\n\n**To cleanse**, I have a really basic recommendation that will remove your SPF, makeup, and any grime/sebum from your day. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. Then apply a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser which foams. This will sweep away anything that’s left and give you a good foundation for the rest of your routine. While this doesn't directly help hyperpigmentation specifically, it's a critical step especially for people who are acne>PIH prone. It also gives you a nice clean slate to apply the rest of your skincare. I've tried dozens of cleansers but always come back to these two as good basic options.\n\n**For your Buffer** this is an important step that can be done prior to using a chemical exfoliant or retinoid: applying an occlusive that will block the active from more sensitive skin. I recommend buffering around your eyes and nostrils with La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm because it kind of doubles as a nice eye cream, but this can also be done with basic vaseline or aquaphor for a more budget-friendly option.\n\n**For Tranexamic Acid**, my holy grail TXA product, La Roche Posay Glycolic B5 is actually a multipurpose serum that combines ingredients to treat hyperpigmentation with chemical exfoliants. It contains two hyperpigmentation heavy hitters -- Tranexamic acid and Kojic Acid which are great for melasma -- and two exfoliants -- Glycolic Acid and Lipo-Hydroxy Acid (LHA) which is like fancy salicylic acid -- so it both reveals new skin cells that are less prone to pigmenting from UV exposure while sloughing away your old skin cells. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize.\n\n**For a Retinoid** if you can get prescription tretinoin, this is going to be the best bet. Your doctor will advise you on the concentration. More on that in part 6. It will help speed up the rate of cell turnover bringing new, unpigmented skin cells to the surface faster. Some other OTC options include differin (which is rated more for acne but uses the same mechanism for cell turnover so it's also effective in this use case) and retinols. Now, I haven't tried every retinol on the market but I have two that I stand by: SkinCeuticals retinol and L'Oreal retinol serum. The SkinCeuticals is, in my opinion, the closest to RX tretinoin in terms of efficacy, but it's a little pricey. The L'Oreal also does a really good job and is a little more affordable. It's currently my go-to OTC on the days I'm not using my RX retinoid tazarotene. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize.\n\n**\\*\\* My recommendations for tranexamic acid and retinoids CANNOT be used in the same night.** You'll nuke your skin. And for most people, both aren't necessary, you can get away with using one or the other. If I had a preference, I would say use the TXA serum instead of a retinoid, but if you can build up a tolerance to using them both without damaging your barrier, they work really well together. So, proceed with caution. If you want to use both, use them on alternate nights and give yourself a night or two without either to let your skin recover. For me personally, I do retinoids on Sundays, and Wednesdays, chemical exfoliants on Mondays and Thursdays, and I let my skin rest (cleanse, moisturize, squalene oil) on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.\n\nOn top of whichever active you choose, apply your moisturizer. You can use the same one you use in your morning routine, the Cetaphil daily lotion as it’s nice and light. I also like La Roche Posay Toleraine double repair for a ceramide-based cream alternative if you want something richer. You do not want to \"slug\" over actives. This advice gets mixed in a lot. Slugging refers to applying an occlusive layer over your skincare such as vaseline, aquaphor, oils like squalene oil, or healing balms like La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm. While this can be done on hydration nights, it should not be done on nights when you're using chemical exfoliants or retinoids as this may make them too effective causing irritation and breakouts.\n\n# Body Hyperpigmentation\n\nOk, I need everyone to be a grownup for two seconds. These products and methods (both from the prior section and this section) should NOT be used on your genitals. First, you can cause serious irritation or infection by applying active skincare to your genitals. Second, it's really not going to do anything to change the pigmentation of the skin there. The skin on your genitals is different than your body and facial skin and it pigments in different ways for different reasons so it's not going to respond to topicals the same way the rest of your body does. Don't even try it.\n\n**To be perfectly clear, these are the areas you should not be applying skincare:** labia majora, labia minora, vaginal entrance or vagina, clitoral hood, perineum, anus, intergluteal cleft aka inside your butt crack, penis, or scrotum. And I say this as someone who chaffed the precipice of her \"intergluteal cleft\" in an unfortunate crunches-in-the-wrong-gym-shorts accident leaving me with some deeply incriminating hyperpigmentation and earning me the nickname \"skid mark\" from my ever loving boyfriend. It faded after a year but you can still send prayers.\n\n**These are areas you can apply skincare but do so with absolute caution and at your own risk:** bikini line, mons pubis, inner thigh up to the groin fold, butt cheeks.\n\nOk, now that we've got the disclaimers out of the way, let's move forward. Hyperpigmentation can also occur on body skin for the same reason it appears on the face, but it can also be triggered by friction. And because body skin is different from facial skin, it requires a slightly different approach. This is my recommendation for both hyperpigmentation and KP (Keratosis pilaris) because they rely on the same mechanism for treatment: chemical exfoliation.\n\nIn the case of body hyperpigmentation, I recommend a two prong approach: a body wash in the shower and a topical treatment to be used after. Oh, and SPF again if there are areas that are exposed to the sun, and I have a holy grail SPF recommendation for this.\n\nNow you may have noticed in my facial skin recommendation that I did not mention CeraVe as a treatment brand. I have posted numerous takedowns of CeraVe on other threads so I won't rehash them here suffice it to say that it's no longer a brand I can in good faith recommend since it's acquisition by L'Oreal. This is often the brand that's considered when treating KP on the body, but I don't believe their formulations and ingredient quality works for everyone.\n\n**For the body wash**, I recommend Neutrogena body clear with Salicylic acid. This is an exfoliating body wash that will help clear away dead skin cells on the surface allowing new ones to come through. To be effective, you want it to sit on your skin for a little while. I recommend lathering it up and applying it after turning off your shower faucet and letting it sit for 2 or 3 minutes. This is when I like to knock out shower emails. Then rinse away.\n\n**On towel dried skin after your shower**, apply AmLactin Bumps Be Gone. Again, this is formulated for KP but the reason I like it is because it contains lactic acid which will also give the assist on brightening hyperpigmented body skin. The wash and this should be effective, but you might also want to mix in a few drops of the alpha arbutin serum I recommended for your facial routine, maybe three drops per application area (each leg, each arm, chest, etc). I generally don't encourage facial products on the body because it's not an economical use for them, and also because body skin is a little more resilient and doesn't need skincare that's formulated for more sensitive facial skin. The AA serum from the Ordinary is very affordable however and is a good hyperpigmentation generalist.\n\nAnother one that I mentioned in the facial hyperpigmentation portion that can work well on the body is the Hada Labo whitening lotion. Again, this is formulated around tranexamic acid which is very effective for hyperpigmentation and a little bit if this stuff goes a long way. I buy it in bulk from Japanese Importers though it's also available on Amazon for a slightly higher price. If you find yourself in Asia, stock up on it. I use this specifically for fading tan lines that happen (even with diligent/neurotic SPF use) around my fitness watch and the straps of my workout tops that I run in.\n\n**You also want to wear SPF on areas that are exposed to the sun** to prevent pigmentation from occurring. The one I absolutely love that’s not your 90’s banana boat is Aveeno Protect + Hydrate lotion with SPF 60. This is a great SPF for a lot of reasons: it finishes like a lotion instead of a sunscreen, it dries down totally clear, and it has a pleasant, slight sweet scent. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being bare skin, 10 being banana boat slathered on by your mom in 1997, and regular body lotion being a 2, I give Aveeno Protect + Hydrate a 2.5 in terms of texture and feel-finish. I use it as my daily lotion on my neck, arms, shoulders, and chest. If you're more active you might need a heavier hitter here like a sport sunscreen.\n\n# Nuclear Options\n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the in-office procedure route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office procedures and RX treatments easier and more effective. Part of it is so you have a good maintenance routine in place to use after the fact to preserve the results of your in-office procedure which can sometimes be costly. Lastly, while some procedures can solve the immediate problem completely, topical skincare can be really effective at treating other adjacent conditions like redness, acne, and fine lines.\n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues like acne and hyperpigmentation. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat hyperpigmentation such as melasma, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting procedures and topicals that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options.\n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done by dermatologists. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or phenol peels may be done for cases of severe hyperpigmentation, but high concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used. I do these twice a year. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup.\n\n\\*\\*\\*IPL Therapy and Laser Therapy may not work for everyone and in some cases may exacerbate hyperpigmentation so you really want to work with dermatologists with a lot of experience in treating cases similar to yours to determine if these interventions are appropriate for you.\n\n**IPL Treatment:** Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy can treat hyperpigmentation by targeting the melanin in the skin with a broad spectrum of light wavelengths, heating and breaking the melanin down. IPL is particularly effective for treating sun damage and age spots, as well as other forms of hyperpigmentation. The treatment is relatively non-invasive, with minimal downtime, making it a popular option. This is also a great treatment for the redness associated with enlarged blood vessels (often confused for broken capillaries) on the surface of the skin which can also appear alongside hyperpigmentation. There isn't any clinical evidence to support at-home IPL devices being effective in the same way. That doesn't mean it's not possible, it's just not studied enough to be certain. Most at-home IPL devices do not operate in effective wavelengths the way professional grade ones do.\n\n**Laser Therapy:** Fractional and CO2 lasers can be used to treat a range of hyperpigmentation issues, including sun damage, age spots, and melasma. The treatment works by removing the top layers of skin, which contain the excess pigmentation, revealing fresh, healthy skin cells underneath. The lasers also stimulate the production of collagen, which helps to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n**Hydroquinone:** This isn't an in-office procedure like the aforementioned treatments, but it is firewalled behind a prescription meaning you can only access hydroquinone in effective concentrations by working with a doctor. This is a somewhat new development at least in the US following some covid-era rejiggering of prescription clearances. HDQ is controversial because it's a skin bleaching agent which has some cultural implications in places where light skin is favored over natural pigmentation. HDQ technically works the same way other OTC tyrosinase inhibitors do (in fact arbutin actually metabolizes into HDQ when applied to the skin), pure HDQ happens to be the most powerful version of them. It lightens any skin it touches, not just hyperpigmented skin in higher concentrations which can make it tough to use. This effect isn't as profound in the other tyrosinase inhibitors I mentioned making them much easier to use over HDQ which, in high concentrations, must be dotted on the skin in only hyperpigmented areas. So HDQ is really reserved for intervention in extreme or OTC treatment-resistance cases.\n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. I mentioned retinoids in the routine so if you're able to get your hands on a prescription from a doctor, it may be more effective than OTC retinols. Most doctors will prescribe a retinoid over hydroquinone, so this is usually easier to procure and can be quite effective on its own as a hyperpigmentation treatment. OTC differin is the only retinoid available over-the-counter (in the US) which can also be used for hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, or as an acne treatment because of its antiseptic properties, but it can also be an effective hyperpigmentation treatment for its tyrosinase-inhibiting ability.\n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

I was feeling great today, I had just bought a new pair of short shorts. They're sheer and billowy so I just threw on a little nude thong underneath. For lunch I grabbed a huge sandwich with a friend, she didn't want her pickles (this place makes their own and they're AWESOME) so I happily scarfed down a huge amount with my lunch. 10 minutes later I was driving home and start to get that familiar rumble in my stomach signaling I might need to make da poopy pretty soon, but I could wait. Within 5 minutes that rumble turned into an INTENSE cramping, the kind that makes you break out in a cold sweat, my hands were shaking and I was starting to see double. I was about 10 minutes from my house. I floored it as the cramping intensified. Just as I rounded the corner to my street, shit started reverse raping my poor virgin asshole in a violent poo-nami. Tears flowed from my eyes as diarrhea flowed from my ass. But not just any diarrhea, it's like my digestive system literally forgot it had to digest those pickles and my poop could be described as nothing less than the feeling of swabbing my tender balloon knot with a red hot branding iron. I was sobbing hysterically while pulling into my driveway as I had now ruined my shorts and car seat. I frantically dashed from my car and ran directly into the mailman, his face instantly went pale as he noticed putrid coffee pickle shit seeping through my shorts, my thong not doing a thing to stop it, I burst into tears again and ran to my bathroom where I ripped my shorts and panties off and started trying to clean myself up. I thought I had suffered enough now...but no, the gods were still angry for as I weakly reached for some summers eve wipes (vagina wipes to keep your lady bits smelling like flowers) But I accidentally grabbed some makeup remover wipes that are essentially just napkins soaked in salicylic acid. Now, for those of you that have never put salicylic acid on your face it fucking BURNS. Now, imagine having shit razor blades and fire and bleach and having the equivalent of an open wound (MY VAGINA) and rubbing those acid wipes ALL OVER YOUR DOWNSTAIRS. I began screaming as the pain immediately hit me. I crawled into the shower and sat spread eagle on the floor furiously rubbing my poor puss and tush. My labia turned bright red and my ass never stopped stinging. I dragged myself like a dog with broken legs to my bed and am now lying naked with a pillow crammed between my legs praying for the pain and misery to end. \n\n**EDIT:**Hey thanks for the gold, man. Glad you felt my burning crotch and ass was worth it, and as for an update: I used \"anti-icky-poo\" to clean my car seats, threw away my shorts and underwear, and the swelling in my labia went down. It's still a little uncomfortable to sit in certain positions but I think I'm going to make it!",

My skin is really prone to pigmentation at the slightest bit of friction or cut, and I had lots of it. I used Kojie San   and it cleared up almost all of it for me. Have so many pics of not just my face, but also my body that have improved beyond recognition because of this Tretinoin + Kojie San Soap. Tretinoin is the ultimate product for getting that plump, youthful looking and smooth skin and reducing acne. Meanwhile Kojie San will take care of any and all pigmentation.

It got to the point I had no self-confidence left whatsoever and I am a very experienced and trusted General Manager who is sent to other countries to build teams, get the business on its feet and then move on to the next assignment.\n\nI started avoiding being in pictures and rarely had face to face meetings, which is not my leadership style.\n\nAnyway, after seeing countless dermatologists (in New Zealand, Singapore, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Malaysia), specialists, blood works, herbal treatments and just about anything anyone would swear by, I would give it a shot; out of desperation.\n\n*Please note that my acne got a lot worse after my divorce and I was on antidepressants for a wee while but my hormones tests showed everything was ok and I was off of them after a short use.\n\nThen, after years and years of agony, I finally gave tretinoin a shot. My sister is the one who first recommended it to me and I started using it after watching one particular YouTuber.\n\n*Happy to say that 1 year later, I am completely acne free and my scars are gone (mostly).\n\n*I also stopped getting tanned and avoided sun completely. I always wore sunscreen but would still go out in the sun because like most Kiwis, I liked to get tanned. But now I wear sunscreen and still stay out of the sun. Yeah I am starting to look paler now but a worthy tradeoff\n\nMy routine is very simple. I am not going to go into the details of all the products I tried and that helped a little. I'll just mention the ones that not on helped but transformed my skin:\n\n- Tretinoin 0.025%\n- CeraVe moisturizing cream (the tub kind)\n- Mineral sunscreen (unfortunately Neutrogena is the only popular and easily available one in Oman where I was recently stationed)\n- For face wash I used Kojie San soap bar for like 7 months and it really did work but then I couldn't find it anywhere so I started using Neutrogena Grapefruit extract mild daily scrub face wash with 2% salicylic Acid. (This face wash made my skin a bit sensitive though)\n\nAny and all questions are welcome my friends and I wish you all the best and believe me, it will get better. There is always a way, and if you can't find it, make your own. I was starting to lose hope after all these years but now I am the happiest I have been in a very very long time (clear skin is a big part of it).",

My sis helped me figure that out\n- I have IBS and my acne ALWAYS got worse when I had eggs. I didn't have eggs for over 5 years but now I have gradually reintroduced eggs in my diet and no flare-ups. Now I make sure I only consume free-range (cage free), vegetarian fed eggs. The once I get always have Halal stamp on them.\n- Ever since I got my skin cleared up, I only had one breakout and the culprit was egg. I was staying at a hotel and gave the F&B supervisor my own eggs that I had brought with me and told them my specific dietary requirements for eggs (not the first time I had done this, they are always super nice about it and I tip them all handsomely for going that extra mile). There was a communication breakdown and I was served regular eggs Benedict in the morning. Supervisor was honest enough to come clean and inform me in case if it were a medical emergency.\n- please remember that everyone has a different skin type and what worked for me may not work for you but don't be discouraged. You will find what suits you the best and it will be all ok\n- Be patient and consistent. Take everything you read online or watch on YouTube with a pinch of salt. Nothing is black and white.

    "body": "Hey-Oh! So, I see some form of this question multiple times per day in various skin and personal care subs: How do I deal with my hyperpigmentation? I also asked myself this question a few years ago. See, I'm prone to freckles and a little melasma and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern, especially among people in their 30s. This started as a small post about my routine and ballooned into a massive book about hyperpigmentation. I hope it's helpful! \n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* I use the term \"brightening\" instead of \"lightening\" which is a subtle distinction. None of the ingredients or methods I recommend bleach your skin as \"lightening\" would suggest, but they can reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. \"Brightening\" tends to be a confusing term in skincare, but for the purposes of this post, I use it as a descriptor for anything that helps prevent or reduce melanin in hyperpigmented skin.\n* I will use the term \"hyperpigmentation\" ad nauseam as a catch-all term for excess pigmentation in the skin including freckles, melasma, PIH and dark spots. This does not encompass moles which are different. This is also different from redness, which is a whole other post.\n* Speaking about hyperpigmentation requires some sensitivity to very real issues around it including cultural implications. This post is not intended to moralize hyperpigmentation nor is it intended to alienate the normal melaninization of skin across various tones. Hyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production on the skin in the form of spots that are darker than the surrounding skin. It's not bad or wrong, nor does it speak to anyone not \"doing a good enough job\" of taking care of themselves.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't have any products I've formulated myself to promote. This is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:hyperpigmentation. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need: \n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Hyperpigmentation\n2. What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n3. How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n4. How to Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n5. Body Hyperpigmentation\n6. Nuclear Options \n\nLet's get to it! \n\n**Types of Hyperpigmentation** \n\nHyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production in the skin, but it can actually take a couple different forms. Knowing the type of hyperpigmentation you're experiencing is key to understanding if and how it can be treated. \n\n**Freckles**: Freckles are incredibly common, especially for people with lighter skin tones. They are small, brown or reddish-brown dots often clustered on the skin. They develop on the surface and are not raised bumps. Freckles can appear anywhere on the body but are common on the face. Freckles are permanent, but the color, contrast and severity can vary and be tempered. \n\n**Melasma**: Melasma appears as dark patches or splotches around the face, though usually found on the forehead, upper lip, and high on the cheeks. Melasma forms deeper in the skin and appears more amorphous than freckles, moles, or age spots. It can create a “muddy” appearance and is very common among pregnant and postpartum women due to hormonal factors. But it can literally happen to anyone and anywhere on the body. \n\n**Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH)**: Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) occurs when damaged skin forms melanin during the healing process leaving dark spots. This is common after acne, injuries, eczema, burns, and other trauma to the skin. Exposure to UV rays during healing can make PIH worse. Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) is similar, but leaves pink or red marks on the skin as a result of damage to the capillaries from injury or inflammation. Basically, when skin is compromised by injury, as part of the immune response cells will begin to generate melanin in an attempt to prevent further damage from UV exposure, so what will happen is the wound/legion/blemish will heal but the pigmented skin remains. \n\n**Age Spots**: This is kind of a forgotten form of hyperpigmentation. Sun spots, also referred to as liver spots, and solar lentigines are large spots/patches of dark skin with distinct borders. They vary in color from light brown to almost black. They develop on the surface of the skin usually later in life, but reflect damage that often occurred from improper sun protection at a younger age. They can appear on the face, neck, chest, hands, and arms, usually on areas that had UV exposure. For many people, they can begin to appear in your 30s or 40s. \n\n# What Causes Hyperpigmentation? \n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of hyperpigmentation. Generally, it forms as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Everyone is unique, but these are some of the most common causes of hyperpigmentation and dark spots: \n\n**Genetics** can play a role in the development of hyperpigmentation and dark spots in several ways:\n\n* **Melanin production:** Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount of melanin produced and distributed in the skin is largely determined by genetics. People with a greater genetic predisposition to melanin production in their skin are more likely to experience hyperpigmentation and dark spots as a result of sun exposure, hormonal changes, and other factors. People with darker skin are also more prone to melanin production in the form of hyperpigmentation.\n* **Genetic anomalies**: Certain genetic anomalies, such as oculocutaneous albinism, can affect melanin production and distribution in the skin, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n* **Family history:** If you have a family history of hyperpigmentation or dark spots, you may be more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\n* **Enzymes and genes**: The enzymes that control melanin production and distribution are regulated by specific genes. Variations in these genes can impact melanin production, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots. \n\n**Sun (UV) Exposure.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, UV exposure is the leading environmental cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. It acts as a natural sunscreen (but don't treat it like natural sunscreen!!! This isn't the point of the exercise), absorbing UV radiation to protect the skin from damage. \n\nWhen the skin is exposed to UV radiation, the melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in the skin go into overdrive, producing more melanin to protect the skin from further damage. This increased melanin production can result in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation on the skin. \n\n**Hormones**. In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, hormones and hormonal sensitivity is a leading internal cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. One of the most well-known examples of hormonal hyperpigmentation is melasma, a condition characterized by dark, amorphous patches on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. Melasma is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, hormonal therapy, or birth control pill use. The hormonal changes can stimulate an increase in melanin production, resulting in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation. This can happen irrespective of UV exposure, though the sun does exacerbate it. \n\nHormones can also affect melanin production by altering the skin's metabolism and pigmentation pathways. For example, high levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands during stress, can trigger an increase in melanin production, resulting in hyperpigmentation. \n\n**Inflammation, Injury & Trauma** to the skin can result in hyperpigmentation by triggering an increase in melanin production. When the skin is inflamed or injured, it triggers a response from the body's immune system, which can stimulate an increase in melanin production as a protective measure. For example, acne breakouts or other skin injuries can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which is characterized by dark spots or areas of discoloration on the skin. The dark spots are a result of an increase in melanin production in the affected area, which occurs in response to the inflammation or injury. In addition to acne and other skin injuries, other conditions that can result in PIH include eczema, psoriasis, and insect bites. \n\n**Medication Side Effects.** Certain medications can cause hyperpigmentation on the skin. Medications that can cause hyperpigmentation include:\n\n* **Tetracycline antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline, can cause discoloration of the skin and teeth when taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Chemotherapy drugs:** Certain chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, can cause hyperpigmentation, especially in areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun.\n* **Hormonal medications:** Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills and estrogen replacements, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if they are taken for an extended period of time.\n* **Antimalarial drugs:** Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Isotretinoin** aka accutane when taken for acne can cause hyperpigmentation due to the increase of cell turnover and exposing delicate new skin cells to UV rays before they have shored up. \n\nIf using these medications is necessary for your livelihood, it is not recommended to stop their use without the recommendation of your doctor. \n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients \n\nWhen looking for skin care products to treat and prevent hyperpigmentation and dark spots, it's important to look for ingredients that can help encourage cell turnover, curb melanin production, and block harmful UV rays. A lot of these things overlap with treatments for other conditions like acne and general anti-aging, but I've noted ones that specifically work on the mechanisms controlling melanin production. Now, this is an extensive list, but I know it doesn't have everything. I've included the ingredients that had the most compelling evidence and/or worked the best for me or people at my practice. But it's also not necessarily a shopping list. You don't have to have all of these things to treat hyperpigmentation, but I'll get to that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets hyperpigmentation based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include: \n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat hyperpigmentation by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help fade dark spots and improve overall skin tone by replacing pigmented skin cells at the surface. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen hyperpigmentation if you're not vigilant about sun protection and avoidance. Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms. \n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. UV exposure is one of the biggest causes of fine hyperpigmentation and wrinkles so adequate protection is essential. I know I'm not winning any science awards for this declaration, but a lot of people who struggle with hyperpigmentation aren't adequately protecting themselves from the sun. But you also have to be kind of realistic. Even with perfect protection and avoidance, sometimes your hyperpigmentation will still flare. This happens during the summer for a lot of people and something even I grapple with. The key is to do your best and SPF actually works well with numerous other ingredients (like the ones listed below) to help solve that problem. Arbutin is a Tyrosinase Inhibitor that blocks melanin production. \n\n**Arbutin**, or the synthesized version called alpha arbutin, is a favorite brightening ingredient because it's a slow-release derivative of hydroquinone that inhibits melanin production. This results in both healing and prevention of dark spots, especially when paired with topical acids. It metabolizes on the skin into hydroquinone which is super effective for hyperpigmentation while being a less controversial and hard-to-come-by ingredient than pure hydroquinone. More on hydroquinone in part 6. \n\n**Tranexamic acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. This was first used in wound care and it was found to have profound effects on hyperpigmentation. Although it's an acid, it's not a chemical exfoliant, kinda like how hyaluronic acid is not a chemical exfoliant. The exact mechanism by which tranexamic acid works to reduce hyperpigmentation is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by reducing inflammation by blocking plasmin which contributes to melanin production when unchecked. It is particularly effective in treating melasma and one of my personal favorite ingredients. \n\n**Kojic Acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. Kojic acid is a natural skin brightener that is derived from various fungi. Kojic acid can also help to exfoliate because it's a slight chemical exfoliant, which can remove dead skin cells that contribute to hyperpigmentation and improve overall appearance. But it does both things: block melanin production and turn skin cells over. Azelaic Acid has a lot of things going for it that can help with hyperpigmentation. It's an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic that disrupts melanin production. \n\n**Azelaic acid** works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin like those other tyrosinase inhibitors. In addition, azelaic acid also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which help to improve the overall health and appearance of the skin by reducing melanin production as a result of injury or inflammation. It's also an anti-acne ingredient that can address the root cause of PIH by reducing acne on the skin. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths. \n\n**Niacinamide** is another one that directly and indirectly addresses hyperpigmentation. It's a skin soother that decreases inflammation and it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne which can curb PIH. It actually took me a little while to figure out that this was another solid hyperpigmentation treatment for these reasons because I used to look at it as being more of an acne treatment. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that works by inhibiting the transfer of pigment within the skin, which can help to reduce the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone. So while it doesn't block tyrosinase, it prevents transfer of pigmented skin cells to the surface. \n\n**Vitamin C aka L-ascorbic acid** is an antioxidant that fights free radical damage. It treats and prevents hyperpigmentation in three ways. First, it reduces free radical damage from UV exposure which helps increase the effectiveness of SPF when worn together. Second, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor that blocks melanin production. And finally, vitamin C encourages skin cell turnover. The key is finding a nice stable version of it. \n\n**Glycolic and Lactic Acid.** Since this list is getting long I am going to group these together. Glycolic Acid is a water-soluble alpha hydroxy acid that penetrates into the pores to treat pigmentation by providing general exfoliation and resurfacing of the skin. The result is improvements in dark spots, texture and other signs of aging. Lactic Acid is also an AHA but with a slightly larger molecular size than glycolic acid so it doesn't penetrate as deep and acts more as a surface exfoliant. As a result it provides more gentle exfoliation to buff away surface pigmentation with an added benefit of acting as a humectant to seal moisture into the skin. Licorice Extract is a plant extract that inhibits melanin production. \n\n**Licorice root extract** contains a compound called glabridin, which has been shown to have skin brightening effects as, you guessed it, a tyrosinase inhibitor. In addition, licorice root extract also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and inflammation associated with hyperpigmentation. I'm seeing more and more of this pop up in skin care. \n\n**Soy Proteins** are another plant extract that inhibits melanin production. They contain compounds known as isoflavones, which have been shown to help reduce the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the skin. Additionally, soy proteins have antioxidant properties that can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation. \n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations \n\nThis is adapted from numerous comments, posts and DMs I've written on the topic and also comprises a large portion of my own personal routine and routines we recommend to patients. This is a generalist routine meaning it targets all the forms of hyperpigmentation I've mentioned; freckles, melasma, PIH, and age spots though it can be tweaked to address these individually more specifically. This is really my jumping off point for people to get a good idea of what they can achieve as a baseline with OTC ingredients before fine tuning or enlisting the help of a dermatologist. For a lot of people, this is enough to fully resolve, but even if it gets you part of the way there, this should give you a good idea of reactivity. A few caveats:\n\n* Freckles cannot ever be 100% eradicated. You can however reduce their appearance and prevent them from getting darker. It's important to have realistic goals and understand that sometimes our genetics will overrule any routine we have.\n* This routine and any hyperpigmentation routine will not address moles. Moles are a totally different thing that can only be eradicated through removal by a medical practitioner. Moles can be raised or not, but no amount of topicals will get rid of them.\n* Melasma is a beast. Sometimes it can be treated with OTC topicals, sometimes it requires prescription strength topicals like hydroquinone, sometimes you need in-office procedures like fractal lasers or IPL. Again, this routine is a jumping off point to see what you can accomplish at home before going down that road.\n* You'll notice I don't mention products with all the ingredients I listed above. This is because the more you put on your face, the greater your risk of causing irritation. Again, you can adjust and tweak by switching out products with these ingredients or add/subtract as it suits your personal needs.\n* If you're struggling with hyperpigmentation while pregnant or breastfeeding, these recommendations may need to be paused. \n\nAlright, let's get to it! \n\n**AM routine -- The Goal: Heal, Protect, and Prevent. In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n* Azelaic acid\n* Alpha Arbutin\n* Vitamin C serum\n* Moisturizer\n* SPF \n\nThe combo of C+AZ+AA+SPF is an absolute powerhouse for healing existing hyperpigmentation and preventing new hyperpigmentation from forming. It makes your SPF more effective, it inhibits the production of melanin from UV exposure (not your natural melanin production though), and it speeds cell turnover with dual antioxidant action and gentle chemical exfoliation. The result is brighter skin in a few months of consistent use. \n\n**For Azelaic Acid**, this is the ingredient for serious treatment. It's considered one of the most effective ways to reverse melasma aka serious hyperpigmentation short of hydroquinone -- which is both controversial and hard to get. It brings a little bit of exfoliation to the table in addition to inhibiting UV melanin production, but it also has a slight antiseptic property which can help with acne. Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. I get about 6 months out of a tube and a little bit goes a long way. \n\n**For Alpha Arbutin**, the Ordinary's formulation is pretty solid. I prefer the Ordinary's AA 2% + HA as opposed to their AA 2% + Ascorbic Acid 8% as I don't believe the quality and stability of their Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is great. That's why I opt for a separate Vitamin C serum step. But the AA + HA also has a little bit of lactic acid in it which provides some gentle exfoliation and encourages AA deeper into the skin where it's more effective. Lactic acid is mild enough that it's safe for use in a morning routine, but you still want to protect with SPF. There are a couple AA products floating around but I think TO's product is probably the best, most straightforward one. Alpha Arbutin metabolizes into hydroquinone on the skin so is basically one of the best OTC pigment correctors you can get. \n\n**For Vitamin C**, the gold standard really is Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. This is stupid expensive though so I’m going to suggest Timeless Vitamin C. I like that it comes in an airless pump that prevents oxidation over time. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that increases the rate of skin cell turnover bringing forward new, skin cells while simultaneously improving the effects of SPF. It's a great foundation for a fix. \n\nThese ingredients can be layered on one right after the other then topped with your **moisturizer** (I like a basic one like cetaphil daily lotion), then topped with your **SPF**. The SPF I would recommend is Canmake UV mermaid gel in clear as this will not leave a white cast on your skin and it’s generally a very elegant SPF. It's SPF 50 which means it gives really good protection, but there are numerous SPFs you can try. I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Biore Aqua Rich (another Japanese brand), Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD. \n\nOf all the products I’ve tried that could act as a stand-in for vitamin c, azelaic acid, and alpha arbutin, there’s one Japanese serum from **Hada Labo called “whitening lotion”** which has had the biggest impact on my hyperpigmentation in a single product of anything I’ve tried. This might be a little too effective though, I actually find that it washed me out within the first 2 weeks of twice daily use, so now I only use it in the morning. And I’m not a fan of the translation… which is a direct but mistranslation. It’s not a bleaching lotion, it also relies on a form of vitamin C and tranexamic acid to brighten skin. But it's a really interesting to try if you wanted a simplified morning routine in which case I would apply this, then your moisturizer, then your SPF. \n\n**PM routine -- The Goal: Renew and Reveal. In order of application:**\n\n* Cleanse\n* Buffer\n* Tranexamic acid and exfoliant OR retinoid\\*\\*\n* Moisturize \n\n**To cleanse**, I have a really basic recommendation that will remove your SPF, makeup, and any grime/sebum from your day. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. Then apply a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser which foams. This will sweep away anything that’s left and give you a good foundation for the rest of your routine. While this doesn't directly help hyperpigmentation specifically, it's a critical step especially for people who are acne>PIH prone. It also gives you a nice clean slate to apply the rest of your skincare. I've tried dozens of cleansers but always come back to these two as good basic options. \n\n**For your Buffer** this is an important step that can be done prior to using a chemical exfoliant or retinoid: applying an occlusive that will block the active from more sensitive skin. I recommend buffering around your eyes and nostrils with La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm because it kind of doubles as a nice eye cream, but this can also be done with basic vaseline or aquaphor for a more budget-friendly option. \n\n**For Tranexamic Acid**, my holy grail TXA product, La Roche Posay Glycolic B5 is actually a multipurpose serum that combines ingredients to treat hyperpigmentation with chemical exfoliants. It contains two hyperpigmentation heavy hitters -- Tranexamic acid and Kojic Acid which are great for melasma -- and two exfoliants -- Glycolic Acid and Lipo-Hydroxy Acid (LHA) which is like fancy salicylic acid -- so it both reveals new skin cells that are less prone to pigmenting from UV exposure while sloughing away your old skin cells. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize. \n\n**For a Retinoid** if you can get prescription tretinoin, this is going to be the best bet. Your doctor will advise you on the concentration. More on that in part 6. It will help speed up the rate of cell turnover bringing new, unpigmented skin cells to the surface faster. Some other OTC options include differin (which is rated more for acne but uses the same mechanism for cell turnover so it's also effective in this use case) and retinols. Now, I haven't tried every retinol on the market but I have two that I stand by: SkinCeuticals retinol and L'Oreal retinol serum. The SkinCeuticals is, in my opinion, the closest to RX tretinoin in terms of efficacy, but it's a little pricey. The L'Oreal also does a really good job and is a little more affordable. It's currently my go-to OTC on the days I'm not using my RX retinoid tazarotene. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize. \n\n**\\*\\* My recommendations for tranexamic acid and retinoids CANNOT be used in the same night.** You'll nuke your skin. And for most people, both aren't necessary, you can get away with using one or the other. If I had a preference, I would say use the TXA serum instead of a retinoid, but if you can build up a tolerance to using them both without damaging your barrier, they work really well together. So, proceed with caution. If you want to use both, use them on alternate nights and give yourself a night or two without either to let your skin recover. For me personally, I do retinoids on Sundays, and Wednesdays, chemical exfoliants on Mondays and Thursdays, and I let my skin rest (cleanse, moisturize, squalene oil) on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. \n\nOn top of whichever active you choose, apply your **moisturizer**. You can use the same one you use in your morning routine, the Cetaphil daily lotion as it’s nice and light. I also like La Roche Posay Toleraine double repair for a ceramide-based cream alternative if you want something richer. \n\nYou do not want to \"slug\" over actives. This advice gets mixed in a lot. Slugging refers to applying an occlusive layer over your skincare such as vaseline, aquaphor, oils like squalene oil, or healing balms like La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm. While this can be done on hydration nights, it should not be done on nights when you're using chemical exfoliants or retinoids as this may make them too effective causing irritation and breakouts. \n\n# Body Hyperpigmentation \n\nOk, I need everyone to be a grownup for two seconds. These products and methods (both from the prior section and this section) should NOT be used on your genitals. First, you can cause serious irritation or infection by applying active skincare to your genitals. Second, it's really not going to do anything to change the pigmentation of the skin there. The skin on your genitals is different than your body and facial skin and it pigments in different ways for different reasons so it's not going to respond to topicals the same way the rest of your body does. Don't even try it. \n\n**To be perfectly clear, these are the areas you should not be applying skincare:** labia majora, labia minora, vaginal entrance or vagina, clitoral hood, perineum, anus, intergluteal cleft aka inside your butt crack, penis, or scrotum. And I say this as someone who chaffed the precipice of her \"intergluteal cleft\" in an unfortunate crunches-in-the-wrong-gym-shorts accident leaving me with some deeply incriminating hyperpigmentation and earning me the nickname \"skid mark\" from my ever loving boyfriend. It faded after a year but you can still send prayers. \n\n**These are areas you can apply skincare but do so with absolute caution and at your own risk**: bikini line, mons pubis, inner thigh up to the groin fold, butt cheeks. Ok, now that we've got the disclaimers out of the way, let's move forward. \n\nHyperpigmentation can also occur on body skin for the same reason it appears on the face, but it can also be triggered by friction. And because body skin is different from facial skin, it requires a slightly different approach. This is my recommendation for both hyperpigmentation and KP (Keratosis pilaris) because they rely on the same mechanism for treatment: chemical exfoliation. \n\nIn the case of body hyperpigmentation, I recommend a two prong approach: a body wash in the shower and a topical treatment to be used after. Oh, and SPF again if there are areas that are exposed to the sun, and I have a holy grail SPF recommendation for this. \n\nNow you may have noticed in my facial skin recommendation that I did not mention CeraVe as a treatment brand. I have posted numerous takedowns of CeraVe on other threads so I won't rehash them here suffice it to say that it's no longer a brand I can in good faith recommend since it's acquisition by L'Oreal. This is often the brand that's considered when treating KP on the body, but I don't believe their formulations and ingredient quality works for everyone. \n\n**For the body wash**, I recommend Neutrogena body clear with Salicylic acid. This is an exfoliating body wash that will help clear away dead skin cells on the surface allowing new ones to come through. To be effective, you want it to sit on your skin for a little while. I recommend lathering it up and applying it after turning off your shower faucet and letting it sit for 2 or 3 minutes. This is when I like to knock out shower emails. Then rinse away. \n\n**On towel dried skin** after your shower, apply AmLactin Bumps Be Gone. Again, this is formulated for KP but the reason I like it is because it contains lactic acid which will also give the assist on brightening hyperpigmented body skin. The wash and this should be effective, but you might also want to mix in a few drops of the alpha arbutin serum I recommended for your facial routine, maybe three drops per application area (each leg, each arm, chest, etc). I generally don't encourage facial products on the body because it's not an economical use for them, and also because body skin is a little more resilient and doesn't need skincare that's formulated for more sensitive facial skin. The AA serum from the Ordinary is very affordable however and is a good hyperpigmentation generalist. \n\nAnother one that I mentioned in the facial hyperpigmentation portion that can work well on the body is the Hada Labo whitening lotion. Again, this is formulated around tranexamic acid which is very effective for hyperpigmentation and a little bit if this stuff goes a long way. I buy it in bulk from Japanese Importers though it's also available on Amazon for a slightly higher price. If you find yourself in Asia, stock up on it. I use this specifically for fading tan lines that happen (even with diligent/neurotic SPF use) around my fitness watch and the straps of my workout tops that I run in. \n\n**You also want to wear SPF on areas that are exposed to the sun** to prevent pigmentation from occurring. The one I absolutely love that’s not your 90’s banana boat is Aveeno Protect + Hydrate lotion with SPF 60. This is a great SPF for a lot of reasons: it finishes like a lotion instead of a sunscreen, it dries down totally clear, and it has a pleasant, slight sweet scent. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being bare skin, 10 being banana boat slathered on by your mom in 1997, and regular body lotion being a 2, I give Aveeno Protect + Hydrate a 2.5 in terms of texture and feel-finish. I use it as my daily lotion on my neck, arms, shoulders, and chest. If you're more active you might need a heavier hitter here like a sport sunscreen. \n\n# Nuclear Options \n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the in-office procedure route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office procedures and RX treatments easier and more effective. Part of it is so you have a good maintenance routine in place to use after the fact to preserve the results of your in-office procedure which can sometimes be costly. Lastly, while some procedures can solve the immediate problem completely, topical skincare can be really effective at treating other adjacent conditions like redness, acne, and fine lines. \n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues like acne and hyperpigmentation. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat hyperpigmentation such as melasma, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting procedures and topicals that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options. \n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done by dermatologists. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or phenol peels may be done for cases of severe hyperpigmentation, but high concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used. I do these twice a year. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup. \n\n\\*\\*\\*IPL Therapy and Laser Therapy may not work for everyone and in some cases may exacerbate hyperpigmentation so you really want to work with dermatologists with a lot of experience in treating cases similar to yours to determine if these interventions are appropriate for you. \n\n**IPL Treatment:** Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy can treat hyperpigmentation by targeting the melanin in the skin with a broad spectrum of light wavelengths, heating and breaking the melanin down. IPL is particularly effective for treating sun damage and age spots, as well as other forms of hyperpigmentation. The treatment is relatively non-invasive, with minimal downtime, making it a popular option. This is also a great treatment for the redness associated with enlarged blood vessels (often confused for broken capillaries) on the surface of the skin which can also appear alongside hyperpigmentation. There isn't any clinical evidence to support at-home IPL devices being effective in the same way. That doesn't mean it's not possible, it's just not studied enough to be certain. Most at-home IPL devices do not operate in effective wavelengths the way professional grade ones do. \n\n**Laser Therapy:** Fractional and CO2 lasers can be used to treat a range of hyperpigmentation issues, including sun damage, age spots, and melasma. The treatment works by removing the top layers of skin, which contain the excess pigmentation, revealing fresh, healthy skin cells underneath. The lasers also stimulate the production of collagen, which helps to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. \n\n**Hydroquinone**: This isn't an in-office procedure like the aforementioned treatments, but it is firewalled behind a prescription meaning you can only access hydroquinone in effective concentrations by working with a doctor. This is a somewhat new development at least in the US following some covid-era rejiggering of prescription clearances. HDQ is controversial because it's a skin bleaching agent which has some cultural implications in places where light skin is favored over natural pigmentation. HDQ technically works the same way other OTC tyrosinase inhibitors do (in fact arbutin actually metabolizes into HDQ when applied to the skin), pure HDQ happens to be the most powerful version of them. It lightens any skin it touches, not just hyperpigmented skin in higher concentrations which can make it tough to use. This effect isn't as profound in the other tyrosinase inhibitors I mentioned making them much easier to use over HDQ which, in high concentrations, must be dotted on the skin in only hyperpigmented areas. So HDQ is really reserved for intervention in extreme or OTC treatment-resistance cases. \n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. I mentioned retinoids in the routine so if you're able to get your hands on a prescription from a doctor, it may be more effective than OTC retinols. Most doctors will prescribe a retinoid over hydroquinone, so this is usually easier to procure and can be quite effective on its own as a hyperpigmentation treatment. OTC differin is the only retinoid available over-the-counter (in the US) which can also be used for hyperpigmentation. \n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, or as an acne treatment because of its antiseptic properties, but it can also be an effective hyperpigmentation treatment for its tyrosinase-inhibiting ability. \n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

        "body": "Wowwowow insanely comprehensive and great info. Also beautifully presented and well formatted! So glad to see so many great suggestions and some of my favorite combinations too.\n\n  \n\n\nOne thing I wanted to comment on was the part about using tranexamic OR retinoids and how you suggested using them and just further clarify that that's, as you pointed out, something specific to the products you were suggesting in this example because the LRP glycolic b5 obviously has glycolic. So it is very much appreciated that you were attentive enough to point out that using retinoids and glycolic on the same night is a big risk for most people 😇\n\n  \n\n\nSince tranexamic itself isn't going to lead to any additional irritation risk, by itself it's safe to use with whatever else you'd like if the formualtion doesn't contain other actives that would add irritation risk. Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic + niacinamide) is one of the generic options I would suggest that won't be adding additional irritation risk, and can certainly be used with retinoids comfortably. Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic + niacinamide). Some other options with just slight exfoliation power but can be comfortably layered with retinoids without significant tolerance risk is Be Minimalist Tranexamic acid serum has no niacinamide, but has 3% mandelic and 0.3% salicylic, and HPA. Those are my 2 primary reccs. There's also Naturium Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic acid, niacinamide, licorice, kojic acid) which is more impressive on paper but all of them are excellent.\n\n  \n\n\nThe second is the retinoid application method. I always advise using moisturizer BEFORE your retinoid rather than after. Since there's no reduction in efficacy, theres only upside of decelerated absorbtion leading to less oversaturation of the retinoic acid receptors which is what leads to those side effects. (Using moisturizer before retinoids is also referred to as buffering but I don't want to confuse anyone with using the word buffering in 2 different ways here). Ideally in the simplest routine example, you would cleanse, apply the cos de baha tranexamic serum, moisturize on damp skin. then wait for it to dry down and then apply your retinoid.\n\n  \n\n\nI have a whole guide on how to use retinoids optimally and a list of reccs which I think would be great here for some affordable options in varying potency ranges. I particularly suggest one of the RetinAL products for anyone seeking the most potent OTC options aside from Adapelene depending on your country and very affordable!\n\n  \n\n\n> Retinoid reccs and guidance [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/qtodqu/routine_help_how_to_cleanse_once_a_day_when_you/hkp4w8t/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/qtodqu/routine_help_how_to_cleanse_once_a_day_when_you/hkp4w8t/)\n\n  \n\n\nAnd if it interests you, I believe I have a whole different post linked within that specifically dedicated to discussing the cost:benefit analysis of using moisturizer before retinoids or applying it to clean skin instead. (spoiler: there is no benefit to not using moisturizer before, only risk.)\n\n  \n\n\nFor vitamin C, a fav is the Minimalist 10% or 16% vitamin C which uses centella water as a base so you also get some great additional anti-inflammatory benefit to further reduce any potential irritation. I'm not a huge vitamin C fan, it's great if you can tolerate the extra irritation potential and already have many of those other ingredients you mentioned incorporated since azelaic and retinoids and tyrosinase inhibitors are going to be much more hard hitting for hyperpigmentation :) and having anti-inflammatory ingredients included in your routine can make a huge difference for PIE and consequently PIH to prevent the melanocytes from being irritated.\n\n  \n\n\nI also definitely agree with the TO azelaic being very sensorially and cosmetically unpleasant 🤣. It has a hard time not just pulling with ITSELF which is an impressive feat that they managed to botch the formulation so badly.\n\nWhat I normally suggest is one of:\n\n *  Q +A 8%Azelaic Acid serum\n *  Cosde Baha azelaic acid 10% serum (has Niacinamide)\n *  Peach Slices azelaic acid 10% serum\n *  Finacea 15% azelaic acid prescription (preferably the foam if accessible as it's much more comfortable and elegant, but insurance can make that prohibitive for some).\n\nThsts all I have to comment on for now. Your post was excellent and I hope people get to see it!",

    "body": "July last year, I had severe acne breakout. I was brought to a dermatologist (she’s famous on tiktok and also on this sub, but kinda not in a good way haha) and it was diagnosed as adult acne. I remember not having this kind of breakout in my teenage years but I didn’t really expect it to occur in my 30s. \n\nI was prescribed to take isotretinion, an Everwhite soap and Everwhite sunblock. The oral med really did wonders, it healed my acne and cleared my face. The soap is okay but the sunblock is a struggle to apply. It is very thick and kind of drying. So while I was still on isotret, I switched back to the skincare products I used prior which are: Cosrx Good Morning gentle cleanser, Cosrx Advance Snail Mucin & Cosrx Aloevera soothing gel sunscreen. These products were a great help para mas lalong mag-heal ang skin ko.\n\nI only took 180 capsules of isotret in total. 90 caps for one month and a half, after that, blood testing to ensure your liver/kidney is okay (I did blood testing before taking too) then 90 caps again for another month and a half. I was supposed to take another round pa but after my 2nd round of taking it, hindi na ako bumalik sa derma kasi parang wala naman siyang pake haha plus my face has totally cleared na rin so I thought it was okay to stop. \n\nSo far, I don’t get pimples anymore, even during my period, as in wala na talaga. Though I was left with some stubborn acne marks and may mga pitted scars din. I do hope they will disappear overtime. My current skincare routine includes:\n\nAM: Hada Labo Shirojyun cleanser - Hada Labo Shirojyun lotion - CC Melano Vitamin C - Skinoren Azelaic acid - Skin Aqua moisture sunscreen\n\nPM: Cosrx Salicylic acid cleanser - Hada Labo Shirojyun lotion - Skinoren - Olay Regenerist retinol - Bioten moisturizer - Vaseline lip care therapy for my lips\n\nLast two photos, I had minimal makeup on. Slowly introducing myself into makeup too. \n\nProducts used: \n\nStokes Veil filter foundation in shade medium 003\n\nHouse of hur ampoule blusher in shade cherry blossom \n \nVice Co brontour in push \n\nKiko Milano lip crayon shade pink mauve \n\nStrokes brow pomade \n\n\n",

Keeping them on prevents the scabbing that usually happens w pimples during the healing process which is also the reason it minimizes discoloration/scarring etc. So maybe by having it on/taking it off all day/putting it back on at night its just scabbing over and trapping whatever's left under the scab? Im not sure? If i cover a normal cut w a bandaid the scab stays soft, but if i dont use one I get the typical hard scabs that you can like pick off. Im not a fan of wearing them to work but id rather look like maybe i have a scratch or something and thats why its on there than the discolored creatures that i get just out in the open all day lol And when i try to cover w makeup , even if i use a color corrector first, i feel like it emphasizes it so i just say fck it and rock the bandaid.",

    "body": "The intention of this post isn't to spread hate but to encourage you to be more careful when buying products and taking advice.\n\nYesterday I was scrolling through Tiktok and saw a video of a woman recommending best products for acne. All products were by brand called ClarityRx. One of those products was Fix it 2% pore perfecting solution. The ingredients of that product are water, alcohol denatured and salicylic acid. The insane part is that this product costs $50. I'm not an expert but i think i have basic skincare knowledge to notice that it's obviously overpriced and bad for skin especially for people who have acne. I commented on her video the same thing i wrote here to what she rudely and aggressively replied that they have good stuff, that alcohol denat is purely made, that i should do more research and made fun of me because every product has water (don't know why she said that because i only copied ingredients list). After that i said that those are some of the cheapest skincare ingredients so the product is way expensive for what it is then she blocked me. Her statements in other videos are also contradictory, for example she says that double cleansing isn't good for your skin because it can clog pores and in other videos she recommends cleansers that are all based not saying you should follow after that with water based cleanser.\n\nThis woman also claims to be licensed esthetician (i don't know if that's true cause you can claim to be whoever you want on internet), she said that video wasn't sponsored (she was either lying about that or she's just bad at her job) and she is also giving online skincare advice for $30/h and on top of that she's rude. \n\nSo next time when you see post about skincare online check the ingredients list and also the person recommending it, don't blindly believe everything someone says, be careful who you trust and ALWAYS DO YOUR RESEARCH.\n\nEdit: I'm aware that Tiktok isn't reliable source of information (video popped on my fyp page because it had a lot of views and i got interested) and neither are YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, blogs, articles etc. but I'm also aware that's where majority of people get their information especially product recommendations including me. People don't usually go to library to read about skin or read scientific research on internet.",

It's just like saltwater, heals the skin. I wish I knew this growing up, would of saved money going to dermatologist.  I remember the tanning booth and quick use of dry ice on skin for treatment!! 😳.   The directions read to avoid use with irritated skin, but honestly she hasn't had any problems.

My sleep was better, I had more energy for the gym, body aches and pains lessened, the list goes on. 2018 IS THE YEAR WE EAT HEALTHIER. I got really tired of juicing all of my fruits and veggies so I just started to buy prejuiced packets. I felt that since I was already spending $5 every day for my Starbucks the least I could do was spend that money on something that would actually benefit my health. I tried a lot of different juices but my favorite so far was the Sunrise from Kyani. My brother-in-law recommended it to me and it's really nice. It tastes just like cranberry juice. I buy mine from dtwellness.kyani.com but you can buy it from Amazon as well. \n\nSorry first post but longtime lurker.

Someone also asked for a pdf version,* [*which I posted on Dropbox*](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bkyhwccr9r9cb6lcwptbo/A-Guide-To-Personal-Hygiene.pdf?rlkey=4mytb6c4j0xxck9qyuqk8e3yk&st=kfq799s6&dl=0)*.*\n\n*This guide is very much an 'everything permitting and aligning' type of scenario. Some times you won't have the time, some times you won't have the resources, some times you just... won't, and that's fine. Feel free to adapt this information to suit your needs and capabilities. If this kind of thing is overwhelming or difficult, trust your own judgment and be kind to yourself!*\n\n# Step 0: Health and wellness\n\nAs disappointing as it is to a lot of us, myself included, the best way for the average person to smell neutral is to be healthy. You need your organs to be efficiently processing and expelling the toxins they come across. If you have a medical condition or anything else affecting you, it might be different but… Drinking a ton of water; eating a clean, varied, balanced diet low in ultra-processed foods; getting regular exercise; reducing alcohol and other stuff that’s bad for your body; they all have an effect on how we operate, feel, and smell. I wish it was different, trust me.\n\n# Step 1: Clean your body\n\nIf you’re physically able to do so, try to clean yourself *at least* ***once a day***. Even if you don't believe you need the shower, **take the shower**.\n\n·        Clean your whole body. Behind and inside the ears, in every corner, under any flaps, inside your bellybutton, in between your fingers and toes, under your feet, under your nails. *Wash your butt, your crack, and your butthole.* Don’t be scared to touch any part of your own body. Clean all of it, every day.\n\n·        Don’t just stand in the water and think you’re getting clean; massage the soap into your skin, then rinse it off. (Your legs and feet are not completely clean if you haven’t soaped, rubbed, and rinsed them; make sure to include them if you're able).\n\n·        Wash before applying deodorant. Deodorant isn't a fix for odour—it prevents it. If you notice any smell during the day, use soap and water to clean up before reapplying (try hand sanitizer or skin-safe wet wipes in a pinch). The same goes for perfume and body sprays. Don’t be afraid to buy men’s deodorant if you need something a little stronger – I do!  \nIf you sweat a lot, you’ll have to repeat these processes more often. Also try showering and applying deodorant at night before bed, it gives the deodorant more time to absorb into the skin. Some people also suggest using acids like glycolic acid or salicylic acid to kill bacteria on the armpits.  \nIf you struggle with excessive sweating, consider seeing your doctor for stronger options.\n\n·        Add exfoliation to your routine sometimes, if not every day. Smellier areas like the underarms and feet can benefit from a good slough to remove buildup of products and dead skin (don’t do this in sensitive areas). Consider using a washcloth if you don’t already (or other exfoliators like bath mitts, loofahs, African bath nets, Korean Italy towels, etc.). Exfoliating can also help with ingrown hairs and other skin bumps.\n\n·        There are no rules about when you can shower. If you feel like you need or want that shower, take it as soon as you have the time.\n\n·        You don't have to wash your hair *every single* time you shower. Our skin and hair have different needs, tolerances, and cycles, so stick to what's best for your hair. This will depend on your haircare needs.\n\n**Mouth and breath:**\n\n·        Keep bad breath in check. Not sure if you have bad breath? Ask a trusted person about it (or lick the back of your hand; if it smells bad after about a minute, it’s not looking good brev).\n\n·        Brush your teeth twice a day. Aim for at least 2 minutes, focusing on hard to reach areas like your back molars.\n\n·        Replace your toothbrush every 3 months or when the bristles start to get bent.\n\n·        Clean your tongue. Use a tongue scraper or brush it to remove bacteria buildup.\n\n·        Floss daily. Your toothbrush can’t get everything, and the stuff left between your teeth could be causing bad breath and other complications. Or use a water flosser / Waterpik.\n\n·        Stay hydrated. A dry mouth leads to bad breath, so drink water regularly and don’t go too long without eating.\n\n·        Just like showering, there are no rules about when you *have to* brush your teeth. If you forgot earlier but you have time now, brush them now.\n\n·        Check for [tonsil stones](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21505-tonsil-stones) if you still have bad breath despite good oral hygiene. Tonsil stones can cause a foul odour, and you might not even know you have them.\n\n·        Mints and gum are helpful, but they should complement, not replace, proper oral hygiene. Using mouthwash alone is not proper oral hygiene – brush your teeth!\n\n**Feet:**\n\n·        Dry feet thoroughly after washing, especially between the toes. To avoid odour buildup, don’t wear the same shoes every day, keep closed shoes in a place where they can get some air, and consider wearing open shoes or breathable shoes with mesh panels often, for better airflow to your feet.\n\n·        Foot powders might be helpful with reducing odours.\n\n**Hand washing:**\n\nIt's important to wash your hands often and clean anything that you touch a lot. This includes wiping down items like your phone, keys, glasses, devices (wipe down devices when off, and use a wet wipe or very slightly damp cloth), keyboards, and surfaces regularly.\n\nHands and wrists should be washed with clean soap and water, using a nail or hand brush if your fingernails are dirty. Dry your hands with something clean like a paper towel or a fresh towel. Wash hands when you get home from outside (after touching things like door knobs and traffic lights), after using the toilet (yes – every. single. time.), before making or eating food, after handling animals, and after touching anything dirty.\n\n**Vaginal cleanliness:**\n\nIf you have a vagina, note that the vaginal area needs to be cleaned along with the rest of your body, every day. [I’ve made a diagram because this becomes contentious.](https://imgur.com/a/bK73P7C) The vagina refers to the internal passage, while the vulva is the external part of your genitalia. It’s important to clean your vulva, but never clean inside your vagina. It is very sensitive and it is self-cleaning. The flesh inside there is \\**not skin*\\*, and using soap inside can disrupt its pH balance.\n\n·        Clean your vulva and labia daily using water, a washcloth (optional), and gentle soap (optional). Focus on the folds to prevent buildup. Pull the skin back and clean gently underneath the clitoral hood.\n\n·        **Don’t use douches or steam**—they're unnecessary and can cause problems.\n\n·        Change your underwear every day and *wash it after every wear*. Wear underwear made of natural fabrics like cotton, which are more breathable. Keep multiples of these so that you don't run out if you're unable to launder them immediately.\n\n·        Wipe after using the toilet. This seems obvious to some, but if you’re not cleaning off properly after peeing, you’re getting pee on your underwear / clothes, and that starts to smell bad quickly. It's suggested to wipe from front to back so you don't get faeces (and the bacteria they can carry) touching your urethra and causing an infection. I believe there are toilet paper aids for anyone who struggles to do this. I've also only heard good things about bidets, but don't own one, so anyone with suggestions please comment!  \nWash the vagina + anus area from front to back for the same reasons. You don't want to risk any kind of infection.\n\n·        Get in touch with your vagina (mentally and physically) so you know how it works and when something isn’t right with it. Also remember, vaginas aren’t supposed to smell like perfume. If your vagina smells musky, that’s fine. It shouldn’t smell offensive and shouldn’t be smellable from a distance. If you notice a strong or fishy odour, it could indicate a medical issue that needs attention.\n\n·        If you’re worried about odour during your period, change your pad or tampon frequently rather than using scented products. You really want only unscented, gentle products down there.\n\n·        Vaginal discharge is normal and healthy. If you get to know your vagina, you’ll know when your discharge starts to look or smell different – then you should speak to a medical professional about it.\n\n# Step 2: Clean your surroundings\n\nSome of these are directly related to personal hygiene and others are a bit more general.\n\n**Clothing and Bedding:**\n\n·        Wash bedding at least every two weeks. Change pillowcases often, at least weekly, to prevent oil and bacteria buildup. Some people change their pillowcases daily or every few days (this can help people with acne keep bacteria away from their face). If you’re not able to clean your bedding this often, keep multiples in storage so that you can change it out when you need.\n\n·        Wash your clothes regularly, especially after sweating or working out. Avoid re-wearing dirty clothes (put on clean clothes after a shower) as dirty clothes can carry a smell with them, especially where they touch places on the body that tend to smell.\n\n·        Always wear socks with closed shoes, and wash your socks after every wear to prevent odour. Always choose socks made out of natural fabrics like wool or cotton to help your feet breathe, especially in closed shoes where heat can get trapped. It's helpful to keep multiple pairs of socks so that you can swap them out after every wear.\n\n·        Keeping your feet clean and wearing socks helps prevent odours, but when your shoes start to smell bad, it's time to clean them. How you do this will depend on the type of shoe and its materials.\n\n·        For hot (sweaty) weather, natural fabrics like cotton, linen, and silk are better for breathability. They don’t trap heat as much. Avoid synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon if you can.\n\n·        After washing, don’t leave clothes sitting in the washing machine for too long. Dry them immediately to prevent them getting musty. Using a dryer is better than air drying when it’s cold because your clothes get dry faster and don’t spend a long time drying, getting musty.\n\n·        Hang towels properly to dry after each use to prevent bacteria growth. Wash bath towels once a week. It’s a good idea to keep a few of these so that you can swap them out even if you’re not able to wash them immediately.\n\n·        If you use a washcloth, make sure you clean it after every use (I just scrub and thoroughly rinse it while still in the shower). Try to keep it in a place where it will dry properly between each use. If this is not possible, keep multiple washcloths so that you can swap them out and launder them when convenient.\n\n**Home cleaning:**\n\n·        If you own a washing machine, clean it regularly. This depends on usage, but every 1-4 months should be fine. If you notice a bad / musty smell in the machine or from clothes coming out of the machine, it might need a cleaning. Some machines have a drum cleaning setting and instructions. If yours doesn’t, set the washing machine to the highest temperature setting and run a cycle with white vinegar in the detergent dispenser. Use 1-2 cups of vinegar for front loaders and 2-4 cups for top loaders.  \nFor everyday cleaning, wipe down the drum and rubber seals with a cloth and a diluted mixture of bleach and water ([2 cups water + 2 tsp bleach](https://www.clorox.com/learn/bleach-dilution-ratio-chart/)). Leave the solution to sit on the surface for a few minutes before wiping it off. Be very careful when handling household bleach.  \nCheck the machine's manual for how to clean out filters.\n\n·        Keep the washing machine door open for a while after it's used, to air it out and let it dry off. Alternatively, wipe it down with a dry cloth.\n\n·        Wash dishes daily to keep your kitchen clean. Don’t forget to regularly clean items like reusable water bottles to prevent bacterial growth. I suggest washing dishes in warm water to help soften dried, waxy, and oily dirt.\n\n·        Clean surfaces in the kitchen daily, including stovetops and anything else that may have food splatter on it. It’s much easier to clean food mess off a surface immediately than to try and get dried, crusted mess off later.  \nIf you do dishes in the sink, give the sink a quick scrub and rinse with some dish soap and warm water when you're done, to make sure it's clean.  \nAbout once a month, clean and properly disinfect your kitchen sink, as it can harbour bacteria. Research the best ways to do this in your kitchen.\n\n·        In the bathroom, clean the toilet, sinks, shower, and other surfaces weekly to maintain a hygienic environment.\n\n·        Sweep or vacuum floors daily to remove dust and dirt, especially in high-traffic areas. For a deeper clean, mop or thoroughly clean your floors at least once a week. Check best practices for the flooring you have in your space.\n\n \n\nIf you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading it all! I'd love to hear your hacks, advice, and suggestions! There are things I intentionally didn't write about, like haircare for example, because I either don't know enough about the topic or think the solution is too complex for this post.\n\nI’ll also add that I really think women should be more encouraged to talk about this stuff with other women. I had to learn a big chunk of the practices in this post by myself, and that’s no good!",

        "body": "The general consensus from dermatologists is that **you don’t need to shower every day, and you don’t need to scrub your entire body every shower**. Especially if you have a skin condition like eczema, showering too often can actually be harmful. There’s potential for a lot of emotion, judgement, and shame when it comes to hygiene, so I always feel the need to mention this. \n\nIf you like showering every day or multiple times a day, or if you find you need to because of your job, climate, or personal sweatiness/odor, that’s fine, but **it is not a general rule that should apply to everyone**.\n\nI shower every other day, and I always scrub my whole body with a loofa because that’s the routine that makes me feel clean and works with my lifestyle, but that doesn’t mean everyone needs to. Maybe you shower daily but don’t scrub down your legs. Maybe you take a nice, long everything shower twice a week. These are morally neutral things, neither is better. As long as you don’t have body odor or dirtiness noticeable to other people or uncomfortable/harmful to yourself, you’re fine.\n\nTo get personal, I’ve had anxiety attacks from shame and distress during times my chronic illnesses have flared up and I can’t safely shower more than once or twice a week.

        "body": "This is a great guide. A couple of things to add from my own experience\n\n1) you do not need to wash your whole body with soap & water to be clean. It's best to clean every area to be thorough and avoid missing dirty areas, but in general you only need to clean (with soap and water) the odour producing areas (pits, anywhere you may have sweat such as under breasts, underarms, face etc. and genital + anal area) and anywhere visible dirty daily. It's ok not to shower daily, warm water & soap with a washcloth in a sink and washing the important areas daily this way is really helpful between showers, especially for those who are struggling with mental or physical disabilities whereby a whole shower or bath is not possible every day.\n\n2) take deodorant and a body spray/perfume with you wherever you go. It's natural to sweat and begin to smell throughout the day, so being able to top up will give you piece of mind. \n\n3) white vinegar is the holy grail of cleaning products. I use it to clean my washing machine, as well as my bathroom and loads of other areas around my house. I also use it a lot to wash my laundry. It has antibacterial and antifungal properties and is great against mold and mildew. I substitute bleach for white vinegar pretty much universally now and it really has been a game changer. \n\n4) if housework/cleaning is not your vibe, try not to schedule all the big cleaning jobs for the same day. I alternate weekends with towel washing and bedding washing (I have spares of both), I schedule my deep bathroom clean on a different weekend to deep clean my kitchen. Less overwhelming = more likely to get done as it will feel much easier to stay on top of and achieve \n\n5) your cleaning products also need cleaning. That is your hoover/vacuum, your mop, and all other reusable cleaning items. Your house won't be clean if your cleaning it with dirty items. \n\n6) if you like to air dry your clothes and live in an area that's colder or where it rains a lot, a clothes horse/maiden + a dehumidifier is your best friend. Dries clothes overnight and prevents the musty smell. \n\n7) to make sure your towels stay fluffy you should never wash them with any laundry softener, and they should always be tumble dried. Laundry softener degrades the towels softness and absorbability over time, and air drying causes towels to go crispy. The same goes for others items made of similar fabrics. \n\n8) you actually only need a few products to clean your whole home. Key items are a household bleach, bicarbonate of soda, white vinegar and dish soap. They will clean pretty much everything. I also like to have an antibacterial spray with a nice scent, a stainless steel specific cleaner (for bathroom & kitchen) as well as a foaming cleanser. But you do not need to have a house full of expensive products to keep your home clean. The simple cheap products are versatile and have been used for years, there is a reason your grandma still uses them. \n\nI also think it's really important to acknowledge that for some people, a lot of this list is totally unachievable. Spoonies, or those with spoon stealing illnesses like depression, may find this totally overwhelming. The key message here is that this is a guide, and if you don't follow it perfectly because you can't, it doesn't mean you are dirty or lazy. ♥️",

It was working well for me! I stopped using for over a month when I ran out.\n\nWell I was finally sick of my mild breakouts coming back. So I bought some **Stridex Daily Care Acne Pads with Salicylic Acid, Maximum Strength** (red packaging) to hold me over. This stuff reminds me of middle school. It stinks and it stings. The pads are too wet.\n\nBut I've been using it for about 3 weeks now, and my face is freaking glowing. I hate it. These are better results than I’ve ever had. I guess I have to get over the goddamn smell.\n\nAnyway, don’t avoid products just because you despised them in your teen years.",

    "body": "BHA aka Salicylic Acid might be best known as the anti-acne ingredient, but I think in terms of body care, it's got something to offer everyone.\n\n**It fights body acne.** The first and most obvious reason, probably the main reason for anyone who chooses to use one. As many of us know, BHA dissolves oil, exfoliates dead skin cells, and kills acne-causing bacteria, all of which work to fight acne.\n\n**It smooths your skin texture.** Bumps on your arms? Scaly elbows? Tough dead skin on your feet? All improved with regular exfoliation.\n\n**It reduces ingrown hairs.** Again, regular exfoliation reduces the chance that new hairs will get stuck under the top layer of skin.\n\n**It fights sweat odour.** Sweat doesn't actually smell on its own, that happens after it's been metabolized by bacteria living on your skin. I couldn't find any hard evidence of this point, but there's a lot of anecdotal claims that chemical exfoliants improved people's body odour. Why? Some scientific evidence shows that sweat smells better in a more acidic environment, perhaps because lower pH reduces amounts of bacteria or reduces their ability to metabolize sweat. Chemical exfoliant products generally promote lower pH. It may also have to do with the antibacterial properties of BHA.\n\n**What about dry or sensitive skin types?** Well, maybe or maybe not. Body skin tends to be a bit more resilient than facial skin, so even if BHA is drying or irritating for your face, it might work fine elsewhere. Cleansers are also the safest way to use irritating active ingredients: unlike with leave-on products, you can control and limit your exposure to the ingredient by washing the cleanser off whenever you prefer to. Unless you have a bad sensitivity to BHA, or a condition like eczema, I'd say it's worth a shot! Make sure to treat yourself with a nice, nourishing body lotion afterwards. :)\n\n**What about an AHA body wash?** Sure, if that's what you prefer, go for it! It just won't have all of the same bacteria-fighting and oil-dissolving properties that BHA has. It's also generally harder to find than BHA cleansers.\n\n**Why not a BHA toner or lotion?** As always, it depends on your skin's needs. If you want more effectiveness, you might prefer a leave-on product. However, as mentioned above, dry or sensitive skin might do better with the limited exposure offered by cleansers. Oilier skin types might find that typical body lotions congest their skin too much. Or maybe you're just living a busy modern life and don't have time to slather yourself head-to-toe with products after each shower. And then there's always the issue of cost! When you're using something on your whole body you go through a lot of it, and cleansers tend to be the most affordable of all skincare products. So to sum all of that up: a BHA cleanser is the easiest, most universally tolerable, and most affordable way to introduce your body to chemical exfoliation. Other products can be added as desired.\n\n**What should you use?** There are products specifically advertised as BHA body washes, usually marketed for anti-acne purposes. But you can also just use a cheap BHA facial cleanser. My pick is CeraVe SA Cleanser. It's a simple and fragrance-free formulation with gentle surfactants that should work well for most skin types. It's a bit pricier than your typical drugstore body wash, but I only use it once every 2-3 days, so it lasts me for a good while. There are lots of options available, so pick whatever you think will work for your skin! Just make sure it's formulated at a pH that's low enough for exfoliation to take place.\n\nFeel free to correct me if I got anything wrong! I'm no expert, this is just a collection of folk wisdom I've picked up over time from frequenting this sub and other skincare info hubs.\n\n*Unless you have a sensitivity or allergy to BHA\n\nEdit: **!!! SAFETY WARNING !!!** In rare cases, extensive use of BHA can result in salicylic acid toxicity. These cases have often been related to use on young children, use on psoriasis patients, and use in high concentrations (3-20%). To be safe, use a concentration of between 0.5% to 2% and use no more than once daily. Thanks to u/ZergyButt for bringing this up.",

I disagree with your post because first of all, making generalizing comments like this about skincare is useless, even when derms do it, because everyone’s body is simply different. Not everyone should be using an SA body wash. I’ve used it for a year and it did jack shit. It was money down the drain. \n\nI have serious doubts about the pH and the percentage of SA in wash off products, especially considering the fact that BHAs are way more pH sensitive than AHAs and with all the surfactants in a cleanser it’s hard to get it right. Many companies don’t even bother to disclose the pH of these products, which should be a big part of their ingredients disclosure. Also many companies don’t even bother to put the percentage of SA, from my experience most wash off products only contain 0.5%, which is just not enough to do something (Also the skin on our bodies is thicker, therefore the percentage of SA in many products might not be enough to make a change) unless you put it on your skin and wait for 10-15 minutes every shower, which I don’t have time to do when there are waaaaay better ways to apply body skincare like combining an AHA or BHA leave on product with a urea containing moisturizer.\n\nAlso I have to say, every post here mentions Cerave so much, I’m starting to think a big portion of their ad and PR budget is spent on Reddit.\n\nTLDR: Not “everyone” should use an SA cleanser, most of the time they’re a waste of money, especially for the body skin. They are better and more effective ways to apply skincare to your body.",

After 1 month, I have a follow up consultation so she can check if satisfied ba sa current routine na binigay nya or hindi.\n\nThis is my first derma consultation and I am very happy na nag consult ako. At least yung current condition ko is finally addressed by a professional 🥹 \n",

    "body": " \n\nSo I just finished reading Skintelligent by Dr. Natalia Spierings and I think it might have just changed my life. This is going to be a long post. Cross-posted.\n\nTl;Dr: The book, Skintelligent, radically changed the way I see skincare. Most \"active\" ingredients are marketing scams, and you only need to cleanse once a day with a very gentle, oil-based cleanser no matter your skin type, use targeted, mostly prescription treatments for skin concerns, and use Vaseline at night, only if you feel dry. Fancy stuff is fine and won't hurt you, but is a waste of money. However, I acknowledge that product preference is a very personal experience and that oil-based products are not right for everyone. \n\nI've read two other books on skincare in the past several months as well as done a lot of research on the Internet as I have recently become concerned with some minor signs of aging in my skin. \n\nThe only issue I've had with acne since my early twenties was about 5 years ago when I got an IUD and developed severe cystic hormonal acne. I started spironolactone and have barely seen a few spots since then. I went through a period of depression after that and stopped doing anything to my skin, not even washing it unless I took a shower and that definitely didn't happen every day. Curiously, I still didn't have breakouts. I think I've been pretty lucky in the genetic lottery (only in the realm of skin, my overall health is not great).\n\nBut in the last few months, I've been doing better with my mood and wanted to get serious about skincare again. I'm 37 and started noticing fine lines (my mom thinks I'm crazy lol). So I found a moisturizer that was from a reputable company that was \"better\" than the drugstore brands but wouldn't break my bank and bought that, a cleanser, a retinol serum, and sunscreen. I am pretty happy with them but haven't noticed any differences, so I started following this sub and skincare addicts and doing more research and decided that maybe I would \"upgrade\" when I was done with my current products and add a few more actives for anti-aging.\n\nThen someone recommended Skintelligent. The first book I read was written by a skincare journalist, so I wasn't totally sold on it, but I got it with my Kindle Unlimited subscription and figured it couldn't hurt. I was pretty impressed. The author had interviewed dermatologists and seemed to have read the scientific research. I was not surprised by any of her claims and it all made sense from what I remembered from my teen years, but with updated guidance. She described the parts of skin and how they work; skin typing; common issues, what cause them, and treatments and preventative measures; what ingredients to avoid; which actives actually work and how to tell effective products from those with problematic formulations; and what order in which to use the various types of products. I felt better informed, but mostly validated in what I already knew. The second book was more of the same, but perhaps a little less specific. Also, it was written by a dermatologist and she added some information on in-office procedures and more invasive treatments. Again, more validation. Skintelligent, however, was very different.\n\nDr. Spierings is a consultant dermatologist in the UK and the book was published in 2022. She went much more in depth with her description of skin and with pretty much everything else she explained with actual scientific research backing it up. She explained the issues with most \"scientific\" studies and the ramifications those issues have on their claims. She provided information that indicates the marketing claims of every - and I mean every - active ingredient that hasn't been approved by the FDA (in the US), the MHRA (the UK), and the EMA (the EU) are over-inflated and under-fulfilled.\n\nOver the counter retinoids? She \"critically appraised the randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled (meaning the effects of the 'vehicle' or cream that included the topical retinoid was compared to the effects of the cream without the retinoid) trials of the use of over the counter vitamin A products in the treatment of facial skin aging. Four of the trials showed no statistically significant differences between the vitamin A derivative product and vehicle. The remaining five trials provided weak evidence... of a mild positive effect on fine facial skin wrinkles only. However, these trials all had major issues with how they were performed which calls into question the validity of any positive results.\" \n\nVitamin C? \"The negative effects of UV light on skin happen in real time so the antioxidant must be present continuously in or on the skin at the correct concentration without being inactivated. So, if topical vitamins are meant to work as photo-protectants, they need to undergo the same type of vigorous real-life testing as sunscreens. More research is needed.\" Also, \"vitamin C is a water-soluble and charged molecule and is repelled by the physical barrier of the cells of the epidermis... Topically applied vitamin C probably does not reach the dermis (the location of the collagen and elastin it supposedly works on) in any significant concentration.\" And finally, \"if you have plenty of vitamin C in your blood, topical application does not increase skin vitamin C content.\"\n\nHyaluronic acid? \"There is only one clinical study examining the penetration of HA creams in the epidermis. Though... unblinded and uncontrolled with a very small sample size, it showed both high and low molecular weight HA in a cream base did not penetrate the stratum corneum (the outer layer of skin). \n\nNiacinamide? \"Any study not sponsored by industry shows equivocal or negative findings.\"\n\nOn the other hand, topical treatments that are prescribed by a doctor are safe and effective. This includes tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene (all versions of retinoic acid or vitamin A derivatives prescribed for acne, psoriasis, and anti-aging),  hydroquinone (the \"gold-standard\" treatment for hyperpigmentation), and azelaic acid (best used for treating skin conditions in pregnancy, there are better, more effective treatments for acne, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation). Glycolic acid was noted to possibly enhance the appearance of skin without compromising its function when used regularly at low concentrations. The author mentioned that it \"probably enhanced the effectiveness\" of hydroquinone in the treatment of solar-induced pigmentation and melasma. Salicylic acid has comedone- (a type of acne) clearing as well as antibacterial properties. While tretinoin is more effective, salicylic acid can be used for mild acne. It is also useful to reduce scale in the treatment of dandruff. Benzoyl peroxide is \"the most powerful topical treatment for acne\" and can safely be used in combination with adapalene, salicylic acid, and antibiotics. Use of BP with tretinoin should be separated with the tretinoin at night and the BP in the morning, if it's necessary. Topical treatments for acne should be used on the entire face and not as a spot treatment, \"in fact, using topical acne medications on fully inflamed lesions potentially further irritates already irritated skin... and might be the reason why acne appears to 'get worse' at the beginning of treatment with a topical retinoid.\" However, light therapy for acne or anti-aging is a \"marketing gimmick and won't help.\"\n\nFor a skincare, she said simple is best. \"Focus on targeted prescription products for your skincare complaint. Everything else is unnecessary.\" Her tips for a good routine: \"Use a cleanser you like that doesn't leave your skin feeling super tight or dry afterwards (she recommends oil cleansers for everyone as they are gentle, once a day), use an SPF in a vehicle you like during the day, and use a moisturizer that is as greasy-feeling as you can stand at night (she recommends Vaseline).\" She also recommends ditching eye creams (uses the same active ingredients as products for the whole face at the same concentrations) and the grainy exfoliator (Or anything other than glycolic or salicylic acid in general. Unless you have acne concerns, the skin exfoliates efficiently on its own and doesn't need help. These products have only a temporary effect at best and, at worst, can damage your skin's natural barrier.). \n\nHer product recommendations may not work for you, but I think the principle of simple skincare using only a few effective ingredients is generally a sound one. The bottom line: you don't need to spend extra cash on fancy moisturizers, serums, toners, masks or anything else. If you like the products, they are totally fine to use and not harmful. Just don't expect them to do magic.\n\nSo I'm going to try it! I'll pare down my routine and see about getting a prescription for tretinoin. And that will be all I'll use. I'll let you know how it goes in a few months!\n\nEdited to change inflammatory language and clarify my views versus her opinions.",

I already knew about keeping it simple and what works. All the research she cited is easily available to read and posted enough on reddit like on SkincareAddiction.\n\nFurthermore, I feel bad for the people who fall for some of the inaccuracies she spreads which are small and few but add up. Like she said that all moisturizers are the same and are based around Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline) or Mineral Oil. This simply isn't true and a lot of moisturizers do not contain these and there's a lot of different ones out there.\n\nShe also said Tretinoin is the only topical drug FDA approved for anti-aging indications (fine lines, photoaging etc). That's also not true. Tazarotene is FDA approved for the same exact antiaging indications as Tretinoin since 1997.\n\nShe also says a lot of weird stuff about sunscreen like about how mineral sunscreens are inherently stable and it's been debunked a million of times.\n\nAgain these are all little tiny inaccuraces but in my opinion it adds up to too much in her overall channels. And also again, I don't disagree with the efficacy of keeping things simple and around prescriptions. I agree with that. But I think the little inaccuracies here and there are problematic especially that most people aren't going to research it further. You don't need to buy a book or have someone tell you that simple routines and prescriptions are efficacious...it should be common sense.",

Of these, it seems the author only has an issue with vitamin C in terms of it not working exactly as described. Of the ingredients you listed that are “not proven” I personally see a difference with vitamin C and niacinimide so I’d prefer to keep using them. I do think you make a great point though that a lot of fancy moisturizers, cleaners, toners etc. probably don’t do more than their cheap, simple counterparts. However I think most people know this, and those that choose the fancier products do so because they like the experience, packaging, fragrance etc. Those things might not make a meaningful long term difference in skin, but as long as the consumer is aware of why they’re buying it I don’t really see that as an issue.",

I've tried looking online and can't find any information as to the current names of the flora in HZD so I decided to figure it out for myself. Knowing HZD is based in CO/Utah/Arizona that helps immensely with the plant ID.\n\nLet me know if you have suggestions/theories/corrections! Also, sorry the pictures from in-game won't pop up inline with the post, I'm not sure how to make that happen.\n\n[Corruption Glaze Root](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/2/24/Corruption_Glaze_Root.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20170402031916) - Possibly based off of [*Castilleja christii*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Castilleja_christii_TPrendusi_lg.jpg) although it is only found in Idaho. The only current population of *Castilleja christii* is found in Sawtooth National Forest (hint hint)\n\n[Freeze Rime Root](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/e/ee/Freeze_Rime_Root.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20170402031918) - Colorado's state flower: the Rocky Mountain Columbine or [*Aquilegia caerulea*](https://www.highcountrygardens.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/500x/cdd56dd0d7347dc27aa421c918b212c4/a/q/aquilegia_caerulea_20811-1_web.jpg) Funnily enough, the root of columbine is poisonous. Despite this, Native americans used the root in very small amounts to treat ulcers (according to the wikipedia article for the genus *Aquilegia*.)\n\n[Fire Kiln Root](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/5/54/Fire_Kiln_Root.png/revision/latest?cb=20170402031917) - Although it is not native to the rocky mountain/Colorado region, the Common Daylily or [*Hemerocallis fulva*](https://permaculturepark.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/common-daylily.jpg) grows there and is a prime candidate.\n\n[Medicinal Hintergold](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/1/16/Hintergold.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170719053108) - Another recognizable one, and the reason I made this post. Based off of one of mankind's most used plants, [*Papaver somniferum*](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7294/9612004254_3e36ddf951_o.jpg), or more commonly known as the Opium Poppy. Despite it being the least helpful medicinal plant in the game it is processed into some of the most powerful drugs used for pain relief in real life, hmm..\n\n[Medicinal Valley's Blush](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/c/c4/Valley%27s_Blush.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170719053108) - I believe this is based off of Fireweed, [*Chamaenerion angustifolium*](https://kimberlyparry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fireweed.jpg). This is a common plant across North America which has many uses. It has astringent (stops bleeding), anti-inflammatory, and analgesic (pain relief) properties which would be very useful to Aloy.\n\n[Medicinal Wild Ember](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/a/a1/Wild_Ember_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170719053108) - Seems to be based off of some type of [Castilleja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castilleja) Although which one exactly is quite difficult as the red colouration is common among the different species and a large variety are native to Colorado. My best guess would be [*Castilleja chromosa*](https://www.swcoloradowildflowers.com/Pink%20Enlarged%20Photos/7cach7.jpg) because of its distribution and growth habit.\n\n[Medicinal Ochrebloom](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/6/6e/Ochrebloom.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170719053108) - another relatively simple one. This is very likely based off of the Scarlet Gilia, [*Ipomopsis aggregata*](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3ysGROfAn2o/Va07bWXIy2I/AAAAAAAAyPE/ORmsi63AStM/s1600/IMG_6505.JPG)\n\n[Hidey grass](http://pennyworthreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horizon-Zero-Dawn%E2%84%A2_20170225014107.jpg) - ~~Despite it mostly growing in wetlands/riparian areas and not all over the flippin place like in HZD it looks like it's based on the common reed! The~~ [~~Phragmites genus~~](https://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselectorimages/detail/WSY0035808_3470.jpg) ~~has the distinct red inflorescence and similar dense growth habit.~~\n\nu/blump_kin has pointed out that [*Bothriochloa ischaemum*](http://www.tropicalforages.info/key/Forages/Media/Html/images/Bothriochloa_ischaemum/Bothriochloa_ischaemum_01.jpg) is a much better fit for the way this plant grows as well as its much more distinctly red inflorescence, and I'd have to agree! Thanks /u/blump_kin. Also, what a great username.\n\nBonus: Those ferns in the top left look to be sword ferns, [*Polystichum munitum*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Polystichum_munitum_%28Jami_Dwyer%29_001.jpg).. Although they may actually be [*Polystichum polyblepharum*](http://www.blomidonnurseries.com/media/catalog/product//z/2/z2polpo4pt.jpg) depending on if the leaflets compound twice.\n\n**From here on it is mostly speculation. I'm confident in the first few, but the next ones were tricky!**\n\n[Medicinal Salvebrush](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/3/33/Salvebrush.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20170720022941) - This one was a pain in the ass to me because:\n\n1. Rost says it's the berries from this plant that are medicinal\n\n2. The leaf arrangement (alternate), shape (ovate) and venation (pinnate) are very well defined and so ruled out a lot of plants with similar flower structures. The leaf structure and reference to berries strongly resemble salal, but flowers are much better than leaves for plant ID (also, salal does not grow in colorado).\n\n3. The flower shape is somewhat vague\n\nSo after some head scratching the best I could come up with is some type of Willow shrub in the Salicaceae family, and most likely the Salix genus. This fits because Willows contain Salicin which our bodies turn into salicylic acid, which is very similar to Aspirin's acetylsalicylic acid.\nMy best guess is that there was a lot of artistic license taken with this one, but there are some willows native to colorado that roughly fit the bill.  [*Salix reticulata ssp. nivalis*](https://www.swcoloradowildflowers.com/Pink%20Enlarged%20Photos/10sani8.jpg), and [*Salix arctica var. petraea*](http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0815/1629.jpeg)  are the best guesses I could come up with.\n\n[Shock Wax Root](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/1/12/Shock_Wax_Root.png/revision/latest?cb=20170402031919) Another tricky one, the flowers scream lupine but the leaves are very obviously not that of a lupine. After about 20 minutes going through photos of blue flowers from Colorado, my best guess is some kind of Phacelia. Which one you ask? Well, probably the blue alpine Phacelia, [*Phacelia sericea*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Phacelia_sericea_5296.JPG). If you ask my personal opinion I think they slapped a [lupine flower](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3097/2782596879_e85c283162_z.jpg?zz=1) onto different leaves though.\n\n[Ridgewood](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/d/df/Ridgewood.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20170402031918) Maybe a young ash tree, or Dogwood. I dunno, it's just some sticks and shit. I was never very good at IDing shrubs/trees.\n\n[Medicinal Grey Omen](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/horizonzerodawn/images/4/46/Grey_Omen.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170720023254) - What do I look like a Mycologist?

    "body": "was browsing thru my gallery and realized na ang layo na pala ng pinanggalingan ko 🥹 the before photo was due to a FAKE TO NIACINAMIDE product which i continued using for 3-4 weeks because i thought i was just purging. this decision caused the worst acne breakout of my life and i consulted with a derma after two months of no improvement after stopping product usage.\n\ni was prescribed with the ff. (take note that you CANNOT buy these OTC; please consult with a derma for a proper diagnosis + prescriptions):\n\n* **epiduo gel (HG ⭐)** \\- dried out almost all my acne within a month of usage. only used up two bottles (around 4-5 months) and then since nawala na acne ko, i stopped na.\n* **doxycycline (oral)** \\- stopped after two weeks because i had a mild allergic reaction to it\n\nepiduo and cleanser (neutrogena ultra gentle hydrating cleanser) lang yung ginamit ko for a month. after the acne dried out, i started my skincare journey of finding what products to use for the hyperpigmentation it left behind + other issues.\n\ni'm oily/combi & acne-prone. my skin conditions fluctuate due to hormones (as a diagnosed pcos girly), so even when i use products which i consider are my HGs, minsan nagkaka-break out pa rin ako no matter what.\n\n🌻 **products i have tried so far (YMMV!):**\n\n🌸 CLEANSERS\n\n* **neutrogena ultra gentle hydrating cleanser** \\- VERY VERY GENTLE & does the job + i didn't break out. it does not lather up, so i wouldn't recommend this if you prefer foaming cleansers. WR\n* **nature republic cleansing foam** \\- made my face squeaky clean, but may tight feeling afterwards. WNR\n* **cosrx low ph good morning gel cleanser** \\- ok lang. it was really good sa simula, but i changed bc i think after a while, it made my skin a bit too dry + flaky. WNR\n* **cosrx salicylic acid cleanser** \\- personally this was too drying for me :( WNR\n* **etude house baking powder cleansing foam** \\- helps take off stubborn makeup but my skin feels tight afterward + i don't like the feeling of the small beads/scrub :( i use only very little of this lang kapag i feel like i have too much gunk on my face. WNR\n* **panoxyl 4% (HG ⭐)** \\- been using this for 8 months na bc it's AMAZING for keeping acne at bay. i use this for backne and my underarms too--i don't use deo na because wala akong BO ever since i started using it for my UA too! very drying though, so i recommend pairing it with a good moisturizer afterwards.\n\n🌸 TONERS\n\n* **face republic ph-balancing toner** \\- caused little bumps :( think i bought this because of a discount. WNR\n* **dokdo toner** \\- very gentle and hydrating!! would recommend kasi wala talaga siyang adverse effects for me, though i understand if people find it a bit too mild\n* **axis-y daily purifying toner (HG ⭐)** \\- finished two bottles of this!! i think ito yung super nakatulong sa hyperpigmentation and acne ko after i stopped using epiduo! plus it didn't dry me out or anything. WR\n* **cosrx aha/bha clarifying treatment toner** \\- no effect on me. WNR\n* **tonymoly wonder ceramide mocchi toner** \\- made me break out :( WNR\n\n🌸 SUNSCREENS\n\n* **fairy skin premium brightening sunscreen** \\- may slight whitecast, but i never broke out using this. not at the top of my list, pero not at the bottom either\n* **biore uv aqua rich watery essence** \\- no whitecast, dewy finish, didn't break out. WR\n* **luxe organix aqua daily sunscreen** \\- slight whitecast, dewy finish, also didn't break out. i liked this because it's such a steal for its price!! i stopped using it lang because it turned my white fabrics into yellow\n* **omi menturm sun bears gold active protect milk (HG ⭐)** \\- absolute bang for the buck for me - matte finish and it didn't break me out!!! helps control sebum + the small 30g bottle lasts me like 3-4 months. the cons include having a slight whitecast and you have to shake it well to get the right consistency. personally can't recommend this enough though, WR\n\n🌸 SERUMS/ACNE TREATMENT/OTHERS\n\n* **skin by bys brightening serum** \\- it did boost my skin's brightness a little bit? naubos ko naman yung bottle and i didn't break out using it so this one is so-so\n* **axis-y dark spot correcting glow serum** \\- ang daming good reviews nito but i personally didn't see any changes/improvement even after i finished like 90% of the product :( WNR\n* **cosrx advanced snail mucin** \\- bought it because of the hype. this does nothing for me; i think it's meant to be paired with moisturizer or something hydrating pero since i use neither, i don't really see a difference. WNR\n* **seek space micronized benzoyl peroxide 2.5%** \\- bought it as spot treatment for acne, didn't really do anything. WNR\n* **skinfx adap+benz 0.1% + 2.5%** \\- also bought this as spot treatment. no visible effects for me, WNR\n* **bcp tretinoin 0.05%** \\- helped keep my acne at bay :) finished a tube then stopped kasi i wanted to try other brands/routines. WR\n* **dermcare retinyl** \\- vv gentle alternative to retinol (since it's a retinol derivative)! i think it helped my skin with acne control and hyperpigmentation. super cheap for the amount na you're getting din, so WR!!\n\n🌻 **currently, my routine is:**\n\nAM:\n\n* i just wash my face with water nalang in the morning (my skin feels too oily lately; i think my skin barrier is damaged & i'm trying to rebuild it)\n* **hada labo premium whitening toner (lotion)** \\- trying this out palang. slightly sticky after applying but okay naman siya after a while. i did notice my skin become brighter after a while, pero baka delulu lang ako\n* **canmake mermaid skin gel uv (clear)** \\- no whitecast. would recommend for girlies who like a dewy finish!\n\nPM:\n\n* **hada labo premium whitening cleanser** \\- trying it out palang too. so far, it feels gentle naman + walang tight feeling after using\n* **hada labo premium whitening toner (lotion)**\n* **axis-y dark spot correcting glow serum** \\- been using this for 4 months na kasi nirecommend ng derma ko for acne marks, but i don't think may effect ito sa skin ko. inuubos ko lang siya kasi ang mahal hahaha\n\ni'm mostly exploring + looking for oil control product recommendations since yun ang primary problem ko atm!!",

The rest will follow.\n\nI understand. I grew up with a lot of inçest, was bullied throughout HS because I acted differently. From ~10yo to 14yo, I was kept in a bedroom and abused. Sometimes they would give me drugs and alcohol. I had no schooling or nor social interactions during this time. So at 14yo I had the social skills of a 10yo. \n\nI grew up. I became strong. I realized I am resilient. All women are resilient. Life gets so much better. Do things that make you feel good. A deep, slow good feeling. Not a short-term dopamine hit.\n\nThis is the beauty reddit, but I just want to take a second to remind you that inner beauty is the only thing that really matters.\n\nYou are better than anything you are trying to be. As you mature, habits you enjoy will ingrain themselves, and you will blossom into the beautiful woman you are.",

Is that once or twice a month? Do you leave a tip? How much does your derm appointment cost and how often are you going? Not counting the make up, I can see at least 20+ products you use.

    "body": "Happened upon a guide from a dermatology magazine from ye olde days of circa 2004 which outlined in laymen's terms the core principles of cleansing and moisturizing for different skin types and conditions. These basic key points haven't changed in well over several decades, despite all the gimmicks and new breakthroughs. Thought it'd be an interesting read for both skincare newbies just embarking on their journey and enthusiasts alike. \n\n \n\n# Making the Choice\n\nEvery patient needs to cleanse and moisturize skin properly using suitable cleansers and moisturizers containing the appropriate ingredients. In patients with compromised or sensitive skin, proper cleaning and moisturizing is even more critical. Using too harsh a cleanser or an inappropriate moisturizer can, in many cases, exacerbate certain conditions and can cause contact dermatitis and other problems. \n\nThe plethora of cleansers and moisturizers available today makes it difficult to keep current with new ingredients and their actions — or to guide patients in the selection of these products. In addition, few trials have looked at cleansers and moisturizers and their therapeutic value. \n\n“Dermatologists must understand the ingredients in the products their patients use and what they do to or for the skin. However, the market changes quickly and it is very difficult to keep up,” says Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D., P.A., Clinical Associate Professor, in the Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest University. “They need to keep abreast of this as much as they keep abreast of any aspect of their medical practice by reading journals and going to meetings This aspect of the dermatology practice is just as important as any other since cleansers and moisturizers have a dramatic impact on the skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Moisturizer:**\n\nXerosis occurs when the water content in the skin is less than 10% to 20% — depending on the measurement method, and there is a loss of continuity of the stratum corneum. While moisturizers cannot repair skin, they can help restore the skin barrier and protect the skin as it heals. \n\n“Moisturizers need to stop water loss, decrease itching and burning, and make the skin feel smooth and soft,” says Dr. Draelos. “This creates an optimal environment for healing. Because the skin turns over every two weeks, healing can occur rapidly.” \n\nA good moisturizer should also be hypoallergenic, non-sensitizing, and non-comedogenic. The ingredients in moisturizers are often divided into occlusive agents, humectants, and emollients. \n\nOcclusive agents physically prevent or retard water loss. The most effective occlusive moisturizer is petrolatum. Lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones, such as dimethicone, are also very effective occlusive moisturizers. Applying an occlusive moisturizer immediately after bathing may be an effective way to trap additional water in the skin. \n\nHumectants attract and bind water and can improve the hydration of the stratum corneum. Effective humectants include propylene glycol, glycerin, urea, hyaluronic acid, and pyrrolidone carboxylate (NaPCA). However, high levels of humectants can draw water from surrounding cells and can actually dry the skin further. if not trapped by an occlusive agent. \n\nEmollients soften or soothe the skin by filling spaces between skin flakes and creating a smooth skin surface. They are usually light oily substances, such as octyl octanoate, sesame oil, grape seed oil, or cetyl stearate. Some emollients can also function as occlusive moisturizers. When combined with an emulsifier, the oily emollients are thoroughly mixed with the other water-soluble ingredients in the moisturizer. Emollients are probably the most important consumer ingredient in moisturizers since they provide the smooth skin feel associated with well-moisturized skin. \n\nMoisturizers may contain additional additives such as vitamins E, A, C, niacin, panthenol, peptides, polyphenols, aloe vera, and others. Alpha hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid or glycolic acid, may also be added to decrease cohesion of the excess stratum corneum cells, reducing roughness and scaling. The special ingredients are designed to function as cosmeceuticals imparting unique attributes to standard moisturizer formulations.\n\n Their final efficacy depends on how much of the ingredient is in the moisturizer and how the final formulation interacts with the skin. Despite their benefits, many patients resist using the most effective moisturizers since they often have unappealing characteristics. \n\n“Petrolatum is actually the very best moisturizer available, but it stains clothing, smells bad, and is greasy,” says Dr. Draelos. “Every other moisturizer on the market is trying to achieve the benefits of white petrolatum without the bad aesthetic effects.” \n\nAccording to Dr. Draelos, a good moisturizer should start with an occlusive agent, such as petrolatum or mineral oil, which is not as thick or greasy. It should also include occlusive ingredients that reduce greasiness, such as dimethicone, a type of silicone. \n\n“You might add grape seed, sesame, or some other lightweight oil and emollients, such as cetearyl alcohol,” says Dr. Draelos. “These are oils that can fit between the dry skin cells and make the skin feel smooth and soft.” It is also now possible to synthetically produce ceramides, which are some of the newest occlusive agents to enter the marketplace. \n\nDr. Draelos is excited about some of the newer developments in moisturizers. “The next generation of moisturizers are moisturizers used in a shower. Patients put the moisturizer on in the shower, and then rinse off. This novel technology effectively moisturizes the skin with long-lasting effects and is known as a new category of skincare products known as moisturizes.” *(These are available to us now.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Cleanser:**\n\nExcessive cleaning can damage the skin by washing out the natural humectant agents, change the pH value of the skin, and cause irritant contact dermatitis. \n\n“Cleansing damages the skin because the soap cannot distinguish between unwanted dirt and intercellular lipids,” says Dr. Draelos. “Synthetic detergents known as syndets are not as effective at removing dirt, but they do not remove as many intercellular lipids and are pH adjusted. A good alternative is the newer body washes that remove dirt, but leave behind a thin layer of petrolatum, especially if used with a puff.” \n\nWhen cleansing, all patients should use warm — not hot — water and bathe for not more than 10 minutes. Cleansing agents should be spread sparingly on the wet skin and, after briefly taking effect, completely rinsed off. \n\n“When looking for a cleanser, most patients should avoid cleaners with parabens, fragrances and detergents. Patients should also avoid detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,” says Leslie S. Baumann, M.D., Director of Cosmetic Dermatology at the University of Miami. “Ingredients to look for depend on the skin type, but acne-prone patients should look for cleansers with salicylic acid, while those with rosacea would look for sulfacetamide.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Acne** \n\nSome people with acne may try to stop outbreaks and oil production by scrubbing their skin and using strong detergent soaps and rough scrub pads. However, scrubbing will not improve acne; in fact, it can make the problem worse. Astringents are not recommended unless the skin is very oily, and then they should be used only on oily spots. \n\nPatients with acne should use a mild cleanser (5% benzoyl peroxide wash), once in the morning, once in the evening, and after heavy exercise. Acne suffers generally have oily skin, but the skin barrier can be compromised by treatment, leading to flaking and itching. \n\n“I recommend skin lubricants in the silicone family like cyclomethicone and dimethicone, which soften and hydrate without oils,” explains Mary Lupo, M.D., a dermatologist in private practice in New Orleans and professor of dermatology at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans. “Cleansers should be mild if on treatment, but high surfactant cleansers or those with salicylic acid are good for oily and acne-prone skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Eczema & Other Dermatoses** \n\nAny skin disease will benefit from a moisturizer that strengthens the stratum corneum barrier, even blistering bullous pemphigoid. Moisturizing with a good moisturizer is also very important for a disease such as psoriasis. \n\n“Since this is a disease characterized by hyperkeratosis, keratolytics can play an important role in its treatment. Propylene glycol and lactic acid can be sole, or integral parts, of treatment regimens by effectively removing adherent scales,” says Andrea Trowers, M.D., a pediatric dermatologist who has completed a fellowship in pediatric dermatology at the University of Miami. \n\n“Plastic wrap, plastic gloves or plastic shower caps can be used to occlude the affected area after application of a keratolytic, resulting in increased efficacy.” Patients with eczema usually have an impaired stratum corneum barrier so they can benefit from a moisturizer that will help replace cholesterol, ceramides, and fatty acids. The only skin diseases that generally do not benefit from a moisturizer are conditions that are skin manifestations of internal diseases such as skin cancer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Photoaged Skin** \n\nPhotoaged skin is generally treated with retinoids, which can dry the skin, especially during winter. For these patients, applying a moisturizer is helpful. The best moisturizing agent is petroleum jelly, but it is too greasy for most people, though a creamy version is available that is almost as moisturizing as the original. If other moisturizers are used, they should be the cream versions of the moisturizer. \n\n“Patients with photo-aged skin should avoid detergent cleansers with lots of surfactants. And they should look for added emollients like petrolatum to soothe,” explains Dr. Lupo. “Sodium laurel sulfate and many polysorbates can be very drying. Moisturizers with safflower oils and ceramide complexes are good. Humectants like glycerin are good as well.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ethnic Skin** \n\nPatients with darker skin tones, often referred to as “ethnic skin,” have special concerns. “Ethnic skin is generally no more or less sensitive than lighter skin and all the same precautions apply,” says Heather Woolery-Lloyd, M.D., Director of Ethnic Skin Care for the University of Miami Department of Dermatology. “However, ethnic or darker skin is subject to certain conditions not usually associated with lighter skin, such as hyperpigmentation following irritation.” \n\nIf a cleanser or moisturizer causes an irritation on a fair-skinned person, any redness heals and the skin returns to its normal appearance. However, a darker-skinned individual may be left with dark brown patches on their skin, which is especially bothersome if it occurs on the face. E\n\nExcessive scrubbing and harsh cleansers in patients with conditions such as rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis heighten susceptibility to irritation that can lead to hyperpigmentation. Those patients should use the mildest cleanser and least irritating moisturizers. \n\n“While it is difficult to specifically predict which individuals will be irritated by a particular ingredient, a dermatologist should make sure that patients use products with fewer known irritants,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Soapless cleansers are generally milder than traditional soaps and are especially useful in patients with sensitive skin prone to irritation. Additionally, traditional soaps combine with minerals in hard water and can leave an unwanted residue on skin and hair.” \n\nPatients with pseudofolliculitis barbae may find that cleansers with glycolic acid offer some relief. In addition, shaving gels with salicylic acid can be effective against in-grown hairs. However, these products can be very irritating and should not be used for individuals with sensitive skin. Another issue with darker skin is the ashy appearance of the skin when it becomes dry. While not necessarily a medical issue, it is still of concern to darker-skinned individuals. \n\n“Patients with dry, ashy skin will find products with lactic acid or urea to be effective,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Because they not only moisturize and hydrate the skin, but they also exfoliate the superficial dry scale.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Elderly Skin** \n\nSince elderly patients do not produce a lot of sebum, their skin is dry and prone to itchiness. As a result, the elderly need to be especially careful about skincare. They should wash less frequently and should avoid cleansers as much as possible, relying almost exclusively on warm, not hot, water to rinse away surface dirt. Mild soap, such as glycerin soap, should only be used for local cleaning of, especially soiled areas. The elderly should moisturize frequently, especially after bathing when the skin is still moist. Bath oil can also be used, but patients must be careful about slipping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Young Skin** \n\nMoisturizing is very important in pre-pubescent children since they do not produce a lot of sebum, and they generally get dirtier and require frequent bathing, which dries the skin. “As far as moisturizers, individuals with healthy skin can use most of the products. Just pick a product that leaves skin smooth, not tight or greasy,” says Dr. Lupo. “A combination moisturizer and sunscreen is an excellent choice because you can hydrate the skin and have the added benefit of preventing aging skin and skin cancers.” \n\n“Young children with ethnic skin who have dry skin — especially those living in colder climates — can relieve the dryness and alleviate the ashy appearance by using products like petroleum jelly or even vegetable shortening that has been refrigerated for a cooling effect,” says Dr. Trowers. \n\nOlder children often resist this approach because of the greasy feel, but products such as Cetaphil emollient cream can be almost as effective, with better cosmetic tolerance. According to Dr. Trowers, children of all skin types who suffer from atopic dermatitis often have more bacteria on the surface of the skin. More severe cases can be cleansed below the neck with chlorhexidine, or in milder cases with a product such as Cetaphil anti-bacterial soap, then bathed in a solution of Alpha Keri bath oil. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Understanding the Ingredients:**\n\nConsidering the difference that proper cleansing and moisturizing can make to dermatology patients, it is essential that every dermatologist understand the ingredients that go into moisturizers and cleansers — and the impact that those ingredients have on a patient’s skin. \n\n“Good practice in cleansing and moisturizing can make a significant difference for patients with certain skin conditions and as a therapeutic response to the side effects of medications used for treatment,” says Dr. Baumann. “It is very important for dermatologists and their patients to become familiar with the individual ingredients in moisturizers and cleansers and to know what they really do. Without this knowledge, you may not be able to respond appropriately because your patient has come in with an unfamiliar product, and you are unable to offer sound medical advice.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n*Source: The Dermatologist Volume 12,  Issue 6,  June 2004*",

Keratin buildup around the follicle is one of the last symptoms to develop in a series of cascading symptoms.\n\nHi everyone- my name is Devin Beaubien ([u/Poem\\_KP](https://www.reddit.com/user/Poem_KP/)) and I moderate the [r/keratosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/) subreddit. \n\nI've been researching Keratosis Pilaris and trying to understand what the condition is, why I have it, and how I could improve my situation for well over a decade. I've been pushing harder than ever on this research since my son developed KP as a toddler that was much more severe than mine was at the same age. In these past 5 years I believe I’ve discovered and developed a highly effective treatment to target the underlying barrier defects and inflammation/redness of KP. This was done through extensive testing and research, first by myself in a home-based lab, and then through partnering with a commercial R&D lab that helped me to formalize what I had developed. \n\nThis post will attempt to summarize my proposal on the pathology of KP, treatment options, and why KP is such a misunderstood skin condition. At the time of posting, I believe that this KP theory is the most comprehensive research article ever compiled on Keratosis Pilaris. \n\nIn the simplest terms, Keratosis Pilaris is a very common skin condition that begins with a single underlying root cause. That root cause is located in the epithelial skin barrier around the hair follicle where the barrier has cellular “gaps” (for lack of a better term) that allow moisture to escape and bacteria and allergens to pass into the skin, triggering an immune response. This barrier abnormality occurs well before keratin begins forming in the follicle. \n\nThere are multiple KP symptoms that build on top of one another. From my research they follow this pattern:\n\n1. Skin cells fail to secrete lipids during maturation\n2. Skin barrier around the follicle is compromised\n3. Inflammation develops\n4. Sebaceous glands shrink and atrophy\n5. Hair follicles become brittle and curled\n6. Keratin accumulates in the follicle (creating the bumps)\n7. When inflammation recedes from the follicle it leaves behind post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\nNearly all treatments for KP are attempting to improve the texture of KP by chemically exfoliating the keratin buildup in the follicle, but since they do not adequately address all of the barrier issues or sebaceous gland shrinkage that develop prior to this symptom, the best results that you can expect to achieve are going to be texture improvements. Applying glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, and/or retinol to a compromised skin barrier is not going to do much for improving redness and inflammation. In fact it may very well do the opposite. \n\nWhile moisturizing the skin will help soften and reduce some dryness around the follicles, it’s a losing battle if your skin is not producing enough sebum (skin oil) to moisturize and protect your follicles. \n\nThis next part is going to be complicated and represents the bulk of my research on KP. What I cover here is delved into with much more depth in the article I linked at the beginning (and end) of this post. \n\nI theorize that the barrier issues we see in KP are the direct result of deficient IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1) levels in skin tissue, combined with genetic mutations of Insulin growth factor receptors and the underlying cellular signaling pathways that regulate how skin cells mature and differentiate as they move through the layers of the skin. \n\nConsider the following: \n\n* Studies testing IGF-1 inhibition result in a disrupted epidermis that looks strikingly like the barrier disruption seen in KP: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/) & [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/)\n* IGF-1 and its effects on skin cells directly regulate skin cell maturation as the cells travel through the skin. Deficiency in IGF-1 and/or mutations in Insulin receptors would directly affect the skin cell as it differentiates and secretes lipids during the formation of the skin barrier around the SC-SG interface, which is exactly where we see barrier issues appearing in KP. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/) & [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/)\n* This study identified mutation of cellular pathways (triggered by IGF-1) resulting in the development of KP: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/)\n* IGF-1 levels are lowest in children and steadily increase as you age into adulthood, correlating with how we see KP improve in some children as they age or \"grow out of their KP\": [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451965018300334](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451965018300334)\n* IGF-1 levels raise while we sleep, with sleep being crucial to hormone production. This correlates with people reporting that their KP appears less severe in the mornings upon waking. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160412/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160412/)\n* IGF-1 levels decrease and sebaceous glands are atrophied when undergoing Isotretinoin (Accutane) treatment. This correlates with the numerous reports we’ve seen in [r/keratosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/) of people experiencing increased severity of KP after taking Accutane. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128787/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128787/)\n* IGF-1 levels are affected by pregnancy during increased estrogen production and additional hormonal factors. This correlates with reports of KP severity changes during and post pregnancy. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17492948/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17492948/)\n* PCOS and other conditions that affect insulin resistance also correlate with increased likelihood of KP development. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22374641/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22374641/)\n* Diets that contain high glycemic foods (rapidly digested carbohydrates) and milk proteins can effect insulin resistance, providing a potential link for some between diet and KP that so often is reported in [r/keratosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/)\n* Keratosis pilaris can result from Dupilumab for the treatment of bronchial asthma. IGF-2 stimulates the secretion of the Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 by 40-70%, while Dupilumab has been shown to inhibit the Th2 pathway. This reinforces the assertion that mutations in this cellular pathway and its signaling are direct causes in the pathology of KP: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cia2.12172](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cia2.12172)\n* KP prevalence correlates with obesity, which in turn correlates with insulin resistance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30043128/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30043128/)\n* IGF-1 is also responsible for the regulation of lipogenesis, which is thought to occur through IGF-1’s effects on 5α-Reductase and the enzymatic process responsible for converting testosterone into DHT, which stimulates sebocyte proliferation. IGF-1 effective regulates sebum production in the skin. [https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/133/2/447/3035051](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/133/2/447/3035051)\n\nI could continue but at this point I think you are probably seeing the same patterns I see. \n\nIGF-1 is also responsible for inhibiting inflammation via stimulation of IL-10 production which I believe is very crucial for people suffering from KPRF, a subtype of KP affecting the face with visible redness and flushing of the cheeks. ( [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277570/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277570/) )\n\nSo to summarize, IGF-1 and its related cellular pathways are connected directly or is one step removed from every symptom experienced by those with KP. Deficiency in IGF-1 and IR mutation also correlates with all of the events that are known to affect KP development and severity. \n\nSo the big question is how do we improve IGF-1 bioavailability in skin tissue to prevent barrier issues from forming, thereby preventing KP symptoms?\n\nFor this, I believe I have a very compelling answer. \n\nHere is my arm with severe KP before and after applying this treatment for stimulating IGF-1 production in my skin through a topical lotion I developed:\n\n[My arm after 12 weeks of continued twice daily application of topical RK & Indirubin](https://preview.redd.it/hcka88bcwdme1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9107f018d87f5a5aef81cbd0d028ddfdebe54a5)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/how-we-can-improve-keratosis-pilaris-treatment-v0-3qo9em8anwle1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e9d591e2ac6952b607bbe4dae09b0b9677a6b9e)\n\nInitially in my research I was testing multiple compounds on my skin to determine their effectiveness on my KP. I finally settled on two specific compounds:\n\n**Raspberry Ketone:** The aromatic compound in red raspberries has been studied for topical application and has been shown to stimulate significant IGF-1 production in skin tissue through sensory neuron activation. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18321745/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18321745/)\n\n**Indirubin (Indigo Naturalis):** An anti inflammatory that reduces keratinocyte proliferation and cytokine production in the skin. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838180/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838180/)\n\nBy combining these ingredients into a jojoba oil base (which is a plant extracted oil that is chemically similar to human sebum) I believe I have created the most effective skincare topical for regulating Keratosis Pilaris. This topical solution was also iterated on to balance pH and add the lowest effective concentration of lactic acid to help turn over skin cells without irritation, reducing pigmentation that has occurred due to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\n\nI have written about this extensively on my website/blog, initially I tried to copy over the entire article but there is a 40,000 character limit and I know that linking your own site or blog post is against community guidelines, but if you find this theory interesting or want to see more evidence, feel free to DM me or head over to r/keratosis where I've shared more info. \n\nI really believe that we can approach KP skincare through a different lens.

The Tea Tree Water toner has a display like this with stickers saying \"grapefruit - rich in salicylic acid\". Most of these stickers specify the derivative of the fruit, like juice, oil, etc. so the Tea Tree Water (which contains grapefruit *oil*) ones just saiying \"grapefruit\" raised an eyebrow for me.\n\nSo, I looked it up, and while grapefruits are, in fact, rich in salicylic acid, do you know how much salicylic acid grapefruit oil contains? None. Zero. Error 404.\n\nCredit where it's due (I guess) - the Lush marketing team were pretty sly about this, saying \"grapefruit\" on the stickers instead of specifying \"grapefruit oil\", putting the \"rich in salicylic acid\" claim on the grapefruit in the poster image instead of the bottle, leading the customer most of the way but letting them connect the final dots, leaving just enough plausible deniability to not break the law.\n\nWhile not technically false advertising, this is disgustingly deceptive and leaves me angry and disappointed as an employee. I'm well aware this is far from the first time they've been caught acting less than ethically, but it feels like a new low. Lush, do better.\n\nTL;DR: Lush is (just barely not) lying in their new skincare campaign and I am mad.",

    "body": "1. The Gaze.\n\n\"I remember being able to walk into a room and all eyes were on me. You pretend not to notice, but it's electrifying. I guess I miss that.\"\n\nJM is a 41 year old woman here for a chemical peel, her 4th. The results have been modest so far, limited by her insistence on minimizing downtime. She comes in on Friday afternoons in order to be screen ready for her guest correspondent role on a major broadcast network the following week.\n\nI examine her face with a clinical eye. She has natural balance to her face. The genetic lottery is an unrecognized truth about beauty in a world built on pay to play. A total absence of injectables, a rarity among public facing individuals in my practice. It's not hard to see how she would have turned heads in her youth. Now the indelible march of time has etched its mark. Fine lines in the periocular and perioral regions. Subtle volume loss in the midface. Scattered sunspots. Somewhat devoid of the *je ne sais quoi* that we call \"luster\".\n\n\"I guess I am a bad feminist to feel shitty for it. I don't know.\" The pseudo frost of the salicylic acid  starts to appear signaling the end point. Over the following week her epidermis will regenerate with more compact stratum corneum, more even melanin dispersal, and if she's lucky, some collagen induction.\n\n\"No one wants to feel invisible\" I respond as I prepare to neutralize the peel.\n\n2.The Indiscretions of Youth.\n\nTY is here for a melanoma in situ excision on her right sternum, the product of decades of unrelenting Australian sun.\n\n\"We didn't even understand what sunscreen was. I'm embarrassed to say it, but we actually used baby oil to get a better tan\".  I clean the area with Hibiclens and design the ellipse.\n\n\"I was really scared when you called to tell me the results, but then I told my friends about it and they've all had stuff cut off too! I guess melanoma is like abortion, we're all getting them and no one talks about it.\" She emphasizes the \"e\" in melanoma with a strong Australian accent. I numb and prep.\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm talking so much. I guess I'm just nervous. Don't mind me.\" I start the excision. It goes well and she continues to nervously monologue in an endearing way.\n\nLater, as I close up, I recall an older attending, rancid breath, insisting, \"imagine you're doing every closure on your wife's breast and you'll be looking at that scar for the rest of your life.\" I take time to undermine, correct minor step-offs, and evert the tissue. It takes a few extra minutes but I know that once the adrenaline wears off, she will care a lot about the scar despite her insistence to the contrary. Right now, she is briefly aware of her mortality. She will soon return to the banality of life, this scar her only reminder of the close call.\n\n3.There's Still Time.\n\n\"I guess I should mention I'm getting a divorce\" She says tersely as we finish up the skin cancer screening.\n\n\"Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that\" I respond, caught off guard.\n\n\"No, save it. It's a good thing. But we need to fix this up.\" She gestures to her face.\n\nI grab a mirror, recognizing from years of experience that she wants to do a cosmetics consult. The Moncler jacket hanging on the wall and Birkin bag on the chair are not so subtle clues that money is no object here. We study her face together. She is a Glogau II, indicating moderate photoaging.\n\n\"I got one good thing out of that asshole.\" She looks in the direction of an extraordinarily well-behaved toddler playing quietly on an iPad. \"Now, let's use his money to get me ready for primetime.\"\n\nI run her through my armamentarium: topicals, neuromodulators, injectable fillers, chemical peels, light/laser devices, microneedling, and PRP. We discuss the pros and cons of each and decide on glabellar, forehead, and crow's feet Botox + 3 sessions of intense pulsed light (IPL) to start. She will also start a high potency retinoid.\n\nI calculate the total cost to $2000 and she murmurs, \"sounds good\". I notice that she is still contemplating her face. Her lower lip trembles ever so slightly.\n\n\"There's still time for me, right?\" She says quietly, longingly, a brief moment of vulnerability.\n\nAesthetics is at the heart of dermatology. Whether its our desire to age as gracefully as possible or to level the playing field in a superficial world. We all want to be seen. We all want to be loved and lovely.",

The first 2 pics I had started using chemical exfoliants (glycolic acid and spot treatment of salicylic acid), pics 2 and 3 I was just getting super frustrated because I used to epilate or wax daily and my legs would constantly look like that. The last pic I took yesterday, I’ve been using a Braun IPL Pro 5 since July. This thing is LIFECHANGING. I haven’t had an ingrown hair since the first week I used it. I still have some dark spots from old ingrown hairs (not pictured) but I continue to exfoliate and moisturize and I think they’ll be gone by the end of the year.\n\nI can go swimming whenever I want and not worry about my bikini line, I can wear shorts without spending 30 mins epilating every morning. I wear tank tops and lift my arms in the air because I never have to worry about armpit stubble. My body is soooo smooth! This is the best thing I’ve ever done for myself.",

The difference between the before and after was obvious—her skin looked beautiful, radiant, and clean.

They are normal but you can’t completely get rid of them as the channels that bring the oil from the gland to the surface of the skin will just fill back up with sebum in a few days (potentially quicker if you have oily skin). Your best bet is to use a chemical exfoliant regularly (an AHA/BHA) and also start a skin care routine that involves tretinoin. Tret helps with the appearance of pores and can also make skin less oily when used consistently over time. Hope this helps 👌🏻",

        "body": "Regular exfoliation is crucial for a healthy complexion, as it addresses a multitude of skin concerns. By removing the buildup of dead skin cells, exfoliation promotes an even skin tone, prevents pore congestion and minimizes their appearance, reduces the visibility of wrinkles, diminishes hyperpigmentation, and smooths out rough texture. This process allows newer, brighter skin cells to surface, resulting in a more radiant and youthful look. This is achieved through various mechanisms: AHAs, like glycolic acid, loosen the bonds between surface skin cells, promoting shedding; BHAs, such as salicylic acid, penetrate pores to clear out sebum and debris; PHAs, like gluconolactone, provide gentle surface exfoliation while hydrating; enzymes, from fruits like papaya, dissolve keratin in dead skin cells; and retinols accelerate cell turnover, boosting collagen production. For even skin tone and minimizing texture, AHAs or PHAs are excellent choices. For pore congestion and size, BHAs are most effective. To reduce wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, retinols or AHAs are recommended. Enzymes provide a gentle alternative for those with sensitive skin seeking to improve texture.\n\nThink of skincare ingredients like different tools for different jobs. Here’s a simple breakdown:\nAHAs (like glycolic and lactic acid): These are like gentle sandpaper for your skin’s surface. They loosen dead skin cells, making your skin smoother and helping with fine lines. They work best on the top layer of skin.\nBHAs (like salicylic acid): These are like tiny scrub brushes that get deep into your pores. They’re great for oily skin and acne because they clean out the gunk. They also help calm redness.\nPHAs: These are like super gentle AHAs. They’re good for sensitive skin because they exfoliate lightly and also add moisture. Plus, they protect your skin from damage.\nEnzymes (from fruits like papaya and pineapple): These are like little Pac-Men that eat away dead skin cells. They’re a really mild way to smooth your skin.\nRetinols (from Vitamin A): These are like skin cell boosters. They speed up how fast your skin renews itself, which helps with wrinkles, dark spots, and acne.",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nThe fur on the top of my dog's nose has been falling out for the past 1-1.5 years. I went to the vet, and they suggested it might be a fungal infection, so we tried the following treatments:\n\n1) Vaccine against Microsporum canis\n2) Travacort cream (10 mg isoconazole nitrate and 1 mg diflucortolone valerate)\n3) Triflucan (fluconazole) syrup applied to the affected area\n4) Betasalic lotion (betamethasone/salicylic acid)\n\n(These treatments were not applied simultaneously but continued for at least 3-4 months.)\n\nWhen these treatments did not lead to any results, we did a blood test to check the thyroid levels and found the following results:\n\nFree T3: 4.736 (Normal)\nFree T4: 1.368 (Normal)\nTSH: 0.001 (Normal)\n\nHowever, the following values are not normal:\n\nPotassium: High\nCalcium: Low\nCholesterol: High\n\nIt is most likely not a fungal infection, and the thyroid hormone levels are normal. My question is: What could this disease be, and what is the treatment? If it is a fungal infection, what type of fungus could it be, and which medication might work?\n\nLooking forward to your assistance, thank you all very much.",

        "body": "Hello,\n\nIt sounds like you’ve already taken several important steps in diagnosing and treating your dog’s condition. Since the treatments for fungal infections didn’t work and your dog’s thyroid levels are normal, it might be worth exploring other potential causes.\n\n1. **Autoimmune Disorders**: Conditions like pemphigus or discoid lupus erythematosus could cause hair loss and skin changes. These often require specific immunosuppressive treatments.\n2. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Imbalances or deficiencies in diet can sometimes lead to skin and coat issues. A comprehensive evaluation of your dog’s diet might be necessary.\n3. **Endocrine Disorders**: Even though thyroid levels are normal, other endocrine issues, such as adrenal problems, could contribute to these symptoms.\n4. **Allergies**: Both environmental and food allergies can cause chronic skin problems and hair loss.\n5. **Parasitic Infections**: Conditions like demodicosis (mange) might present with similar symptoms. A skin scrape or biopsy could help rule this out.\n\nRegarding fungal infections, if they are still a possibility, further diagnostic tests, like a fungal culture or specific tests for less common fungi, might be needed. Medications might vary depending on the specific fungus.\n\nConsulting with a veterinary dermatologist for a thorough evaluation could provide more insights and guide you toward the appropriate treatment.\n\nI hope this helps and best wishes for your dog’s health! 🐶✨ #DogHealth #SkinIssues #VeterinaryAdvice",

        "body": "ETA: Holy crap this blew up! Thanks for all the great discussion and support! Between you and my new derm, I'm learning so many things! Clarification: when my dermatologist said \"stop using salicylic acid,\" she mainly emphasized to avoid the 1-2% SA which now appears to be the standard in the overwhelming drug store aisle promising you acne reduction. You know all the ones. She said *smaller amounts* of SA, like when it's an inactive ingredient, can be good for skin but she stressed 1-2% levels are ***way*** too much and it causes more harm than good (irritation, over drying thus added sebum production, etc.), more so for sensitive skin.\n\nAM: Liquid Neutrogena cleanse, followed by Joesoef Sulfur bar (I use the bar when I shower, so whenever I shower that day, usually AM). Pat dry and apply Eucerin Daily Protection SPF 30.\n\nPM: Liquid Neutrogena cleanse, pat dry and apply Bliss Clear Genius Clarifying Toner and Serum every other day or two - this *does* contain a smaller, healthier amount of SA, details below. (Add CeraVe moisturizer on top when my dry skin is extra dry, but it hasn't been dry without the active salicylic acid acne cleansers so I don't usually even need this anymore!! I can't believe it.)\n\nMy new dermatologist is the first dermatologist that didn't try to sell me on 186 different products and prescription drugs, and instead gave me a proper diagnosis of mild rosacea and educated me on a skin care routine accordingly.\n\nShe told me to try something without the max 1-2% salicylic acid (preferably with oleic acid) and/or a sulfur cleanser. \n\nLiquid Neutrogena is one of the few cleansers I found OTC at my local pharmacy with oleic acid and not salicylic. She told when products use a small amount of SA it's fine, but to steer clear of the 1-2% max crap, and to try no salicylic acid at all at first to see if it helps. (Hence me using the Bliss toner now, a recent addition that also contains niacinamide, which she also recommended to me. I think this toner is while my pores are even happier.) I've even had dermatologists try a higher dose of salicylic acid products in the past via prescription. No wonder my acne has followed me into my 30s!\n\nI bought the Joesoef sulfur soap bar online and just keep it in the shower. (Edit again: TIL this also has SA lol *but only 0.25%*, further confirming \"SA is fine in smaller doses but don't fall into the 'more is better' 1-2% trap\" my dermatologist warned me about.)\n\nIt's been just a few months of the new routine and I am stupefied over here. I think my pores are also smaller, wtf who am I?! Wish I knew this 15 years ago, fuck lol. Thanks for reading! Hope this helps someone else.",

    "body": "Dick, balls, face, and feet--let's talk about them all.  It's time we remove the stigma on men learning about hygiene products. It's manly to not give a fuck; it's even more manly to know how to take care of yourself. Let's do both. \n\n# Why Am I Doing This?\n\nGrowing up, I was always sweatier and greasier than most. It didn't matter how often I showered, scrubbed, or caked on deodarant--I'd always end up with a sheening face and a musky smell. It took a toll on my mental health and confidence. I always felt \\*dirty\\* even if I was clean. And you know what the cause of the problem was? Nobody taught me how to take care of myself. It was simply, \"wet yourself, shower gel, spray.\" Well lads, that simply is not enough. I'm here to show you my learnings. \n\nI'll separate this post into four sections: Face - Body - Dick & Balls - Feet.\n\nWhy won't I talk about hair? Cause hair is a topic that would require its own post. There's too much to talk about. I'll give some quick pointers though: \n\n1. Stop using 2&1's you dumb fucks. Also, consider shampoo and/or conditioner soap bars.\n2. Stop washing your hair every day. Every *other* day at most. \n3. Got dandruff? Follow rule 2. Still got dandruff? Change your styling product. Still? Speak to a dermatologist--avoid over the counter solutions, like dandruff shampoo. Most of the time they'll only make it worse. \n4. Stop using heat on your hair. Hair-drying/straightening/etc. it'll only damage it. If needs must, use a heat-protecting spray at least.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nAlthough I can't avoid dropping some product brand names here and there, I **do not** recommend any product I mention. I **do** recommend you to do your own research and find what is best for you. I have no ulterior motives, nor am I being compensated for this post in **any way**. I just got sick of feeling like a dirtbird, and I want you to feel the same. \n\nIf you ask me for advice on any specific problems, my only response will be, \"speak to a doctor.\" I am not trained medically in any way. I'm only telling you what works for me. Take my learnings and figure out what's best for you. \n\nNow let's get on with it.\n\n# Face\n\nFuck, did this take a while to figure out. T-zones? Filaments? What the fuck is any of this shit? Well, for the most part--you don't need to know. Not in-depth anyway. First, let's expel some of the myths and what to avoid. \n\n**Blackheads:**\n\nHave you ever looked in the mirror and thought, *holy shit does my nose look like a strawberry?* Have you ever considered that it might be normal? Photoshop, selfie-beautify, make-up--pores are society's biggest kept secret. First, you need to understand the difference between blackheads and   \n sebaceous filaments.\n\n*  *Sebaceous Filaments*: These daft fuckers are the reason why you have tiny little holes in your face. Basically put, they secrete oil and keep your skin healthy. They're bastards, but necessary bastards. You can't get rid of them, *and you don't want to.* \n* *Blackheads:* Blackheads are when these sebaceous filaments get clogged with dirt or trapped oil. You can minimise blackheads by keeping good care of your skin. But you will get them no matter how hard you try to avoid it. Get on google images and \\*study\\* what they both look like. You need to know the difference and understand what is normal and what isn't. \n\nHow to treat blackheads: \n\nFirst, **avoid pore strips, face peels, or using any form of suction**. They, at best, don't work. At worst, they'll pull the filaments out from your pores, potentially widening them and making you much more susceptible to blackheads/pimples in the future. Even worse, they may cause varicose veins to appear which can only be fixed surgically. \n\nTake a shower, clean your face, let the heat widen your pores, and gently put pressure on the afflicted pores--squeezing until you see a black/greenish substance come out. If it hurts, stop. Pain is damage. A longer, but less intrusive method, is to layer petroleum jelly on your face and leave it there for up to 8 hours. Then, use two cotton swabs and gently run them over your pores in a pincer-like fashion. You should then see the grime come out of the pores. \n\n**Acne:**\n\nAcne is a fact of life. Some are more prone to acne than others, and no matter how well you take care of your skin--you will get them. The best treatment is preventative action. The second best treatment is to leave those fuckers alone. Here's how to prevent them. \n\n* First, **stop popping those fuckers**. That white shit? Your body's defence mechanism to fight the germs that are causing the acne. Why would you want that outside of your body? Plus popping can lead to scarring and the only scarring you should have is from your wild pup-brawls. \n* Change your pillow sheets nightly, you dirty hallions. You're at your dirtiest when you sleep. All that dirt gets on your pillow. Why would you want to lay on a layer of filth the next night? If you have long hair, consider tying it away from your face as you sleep. If your partner has long hair, keep their hair out of your face while you sleep. Hair is greasy. More grease equals more chance of pimples. \n* If you have particularly persistent pimples, consider using a benzoyl peroxide (5%) one the spot cream. In most countries, this can be bought over the counter. Other's you may need to speak to a pharmacist first. Anything worse, speak to a dermatologist. \n* Keep your face clean. Following a good face-care routine will solve 90% of your problems. I'll detail my skincare routine below.\n* Most men don't have the luxury of hiding their spots with make-up (although you can if you want. Would't recommend it though, make-up is bad for the skin), so learning to accept your red buddies and not be ashamed of them will do wonders for your mental health. They're natural. Everyone gets them occasionally. Just like everybody poops. \n\n **Greasy-face syndrome:**\n\nIt's not actually a syndrome, but it should be. Ever see a photo of yourself and marvel at the beacon of sunlight that's bouncing off your forehead? Grease is the cause. Again, you can blame sebaceous filaments for this. Why does your face get greasy? Cause oil is actually good for the skin. It keeps it hydrated, healthy and adds a layer of germ/water protection. \n\nOkay, but how do you solve \\*excessive\\* oiliness? You moisturise. Counterintuitive, I know--but it's true. Excessive oiliness can be a sign of your skin being too dry; it's your body overcompensating to protect your skin. If you keep your skin hydrated, your body will produce less oil. You should realistically be moisturising twice a day. Not all moisturisers are made equal though--you must first learn what type of skin you have and then find the appropriate moisturiser. Think of it like pokémon, some type match-ups are better than others. I have a dry/oily skin combination. Which is the worst, trust me. If I use too heavy of a moisturiser, I get super greasy. If I use too light of one, my skin gets too dry and flakes. Keeping your oil levels balanced will also help prevent blackheads and acne. \n\n**The Face-Care Routine:**\n\n* The Cleanser (Salicylic Acid): This is your twice-daily face cleanser. Once in the morning, once at night. \n* The Exfoliator (Glycolic acid): This is your once every couple of days scrub. It removes the dead skin and helps cleanse your pores, giving your skin room to breathe. Try to avoid any that contains plastic micro-beads--horrible for the environment.\n* The Blackhead Killer (2% BHA): This will help chemically deal with blackheads and reduce the size of enlarged pores. Should only be used on a needs must basis. Once the problem is resolved, remove this from your routine. Introduce it when you have flare-ups. \n* The Acne Killer (Benzoyl peroxide 5%): As before, should only be on a needs must basis. Use on those persistent pimples that stick around for any longer than a week. If you are seeing serious flare-ups, speak to a dermatologist. \n* The Moisturiser: This should be used in tandem with 'The Cleanser'. Twice a day, after you've done the rest of your routine. Ideally, you want a day moisturiser that has UV protection and a lighter night-time moisturiser. Since I'm from a sun-deprived country and...not going out much anyway, I've been using CeraVe's PM facial moisturising lotion as both my day and night moisturiser with good results. Again, be sure to find the moisturiser that matches your skin type. \n\n# The Body\n\nYou wouldn't think that shit would be complicated, yet it is. But--it doesn't have to be. First, let's do some spring cleaning. Get rid of the shower-gel. Don't care how much it costs or how nice it smells, either get rid of it or accept the fact that its only use is to make you smell purty. Don't delude yourself into thinking it's going to clean you. \n\nNow, let's ask a question. What's the difference between you and that nice smelling woman next to you? Hair. That's right, hair--or, more specifically, the lack of hair. Let me explain.\n\n**Body odour** \n\nBody odour is caused by bacteria breaking down your sweat and producing smelly little enzymes. Bacteria thrives in dark and damp places--hence why your armpits get it the worst. Hair only exacerbates this issue as you're giving them this comfy little nest to hide in. Plus, it makes it more difficult to clean the skin when you have a knotted mess under your pits adding a layer of protection. Don't want to smell? Your first step is to shave your pits. Remove their bunker and then carpet bomb them.  \n\n\nLet's break down the shower routine:\n\n* Cleaning yourself: Your best tool is nonother than a bar of soap. And I'm talking a pure, simple, unscented soap bar. Don't be fooled by the 'antibacterial' marketing gimmick--all soap, by nature, is antibacterial. And that's what you want to use to cleanse yourself. The simpler the soap, the better. **You should be showering at least once a day. Try to avoid going no longer than 16 hours between showers**. Showering twice a day is enough for most people. Any more than that and you risk drying out your skin\n* Shave your pits. You want to kill that bacteria. To do that, you want to shave your pits. The soap will then help reduce and mitigate the bacterial growth under your pits, thus helping to eliminate body odour. \n* Clean \\*everywhere\\*. Under the foreskin, between your arse crack, your toes, back--everything. Just because it doesn't smell doesn't mean it's not dirty. And just because you can't smell it doesn't mean others cannot. \n* Exfoliate: Yes, you have to exfoliate your body too. Why? Cause, believe it or not, sebaceous filaments make their triumphant return--and what happens when they get clogged? That's right, blackheads on your body. Luckily the skin on your body is tougher and can take a harder beating than your face. So, get yourself a loofah and scrub your body once every few days. \n* Moisturise: I know lads. We're big strong men and there's a lot of body to moisturise. It's a pain, but it must be done after every shower. Your skin will thank you. Your complexion will thank you. Your partner will not want to stop touching you, so you will thank you. I'd recommend picking up whatever body lotion your chosen brand of face moisturiser offers. Typically whatever brand works for your face will work for your body. \n\n**Deodorant:** \n\nThis is where the most egregious fuckers lay. An institutionalised group of snake-oil peddlers on a global scale. Let's lift the veil. \n\n*What's the difference between deodorant and anti-persperant?* \n\nI know we tend to use the name interchangeably, but they are actually different. Deodorant helps mask (note: mask, not remove) smells. Anti-persperant helps control sweating. Usually, and especially for men, we get sold products that do both. I argue that you should use none of them. \n\nWhy does deodorant only mask the smell? The only way to remove the smell is to remove the bacteria. Unless you get specifically made anti-bacterial deodorant (which does exist) it will not kill the bacteria, only layer a thick scent that overpowers the body odour. \n\nOkay, but why should we avoid anti-persperants? Because they stop you from sweating. Not a bad thing in itself (arguably) but their execution is horrible, especially if you care for your clothes. They stop sweating by the use of aluminium. Aluminium clogs the pores in your pits and effectively blocks the flow of sweat--but it's not perfect. You will still sweat, and when you sweat it also gets mixed with that aluminium, which gets layered onto your clothes and--if left long enough--will stain them yellow. How do they make yellow-stain free anti-persperant then? By adding more aluminium in the hopes of making you sweat less. *This is not healthy.*\n\nSo, how do we find a roll-on/spray that is both anti-bacterial and aluminium free? You can't. It simply doesn't exist. No matter the label or claims, it just does not exist. So, you look to creams. That's right, there are creams. These creams are aluminium free and anti-bacterial. No stains, ever, and they will help control body odour. The cons? They don't leave a long-lasting scent (an hour at most) and they don't control perspiration. BUT, they can keep you odour free for **at least** a day and at most a few days. There's a brand in the UK called 'Trust' that makes one of these creams. I don't get the multiple-day protection as they claim, but I do get at least 24 hours worth of protection. \n\n**Sweating:**\n\nOkay, so now that we have both odour and cleanliness solved, now it's time for sweating. Honestly, even though I did bash them, those aluminium based products are the best. But, I'd argue, if we're not smelling anymore... do we really care if we sweat? Yeah sweat patches can be unsightly--but shouldn't we work on normalising sweating? Well, I'm not asking anyone to be a martyr so let's talk about what we can do.\n\n* Diet & exercise. Obvious, I know. But eating well and keeping fit will help regulate your body's hormones--which, in turn, helps regulate your sweat glands. \n* Mental health. Learn to control your anxiety. When we get nervous we sweat.\n* Actual remedies: There are roll-ones than are industrial grade sweat killers. But, they are damaging. If your sweating is that excessive speak to a doctor. You may have a thyroid problem. I have hyper-active sweat glands and have been taking a 5mg Oxybutin prescription for a few years now. It hasn't stopped my sweating but I do sweat on a more normal basis now--speak to your doctor and get advice. \n\nOther than that... there really isn't anything you can do other than accept that people sweat and it is natural. \n\n# Dick & Balls\n\nConsidering how eager we are to get others to shove their faces into our junk, we don't often extend the courtesy of making it a pleasant experience, do we? A lot of my advice for body odour is going to apply here.\n\n* Unlike your pits, you can get away with not clean shaving your dick and balls. I've tried taking a razor there, it is not a pleasant experience. Chaffing at best, a bloody mess at worse. Keep the area trimmed, no longer than an inch. Wash regularly with soap.\n* Remember that cream I mentioned here before? It applies greatly here. Helps to kill odour fantastically. I know, no more sneaky finger sniffs after a scratch. But it's the only thing that has offered all-day protection. \n* A new addition: body powder. Yep, get that baby powder on your balls. It Helps keeps things dry and smooth--no more swamp ass or nuts sticking to your thighs and it offers a pleasant scent. Kill the moisture, kill the bacterial, kill the odour. Avoid talcum powder--I've heard it might have negative long-term effects. Corn or hemp powder work equally as well. Nothing better than some smooth dry balls as you slip your underwear on. More fun to play with as well. Your partner will thank you. No more flossing teeth while blowing you and no more holding their breath as they pull back that putrid stank container of underwear. \n\n# Feet\n\nThis is for us sweaty, smelly feet bois. Again, bacteria is the cause. But--this time, they're roided. There's very little you can do long-term. I've personally resorted to soaking them a hot water/bleach mixture for 10 minutes once a month. It seems to work. Vinegar sort-of worked, but it just replaced the bad smell with a vinegar smell. The best cure is again preventative action:\n\n* Avoid cotton/nylon socks. You want something that will breathe and not trap moisture, like wool. That's our aim, allowing things to breathe and dry.\n* Let your shoes air out after wearing them. If you can go bare feet, do it. Allow your feet as much air exposure as possible.\n* There are powders you can purchase to put in your shoes after each wear to help eliminate odour and moisture. They can sometimes smell nice as well. \n\nOther than that, we're SOL.\n\n# The End\n\nYep. That's it. That's how I keep myself clean. Hopefully you can take some learnings from my mistakes. Ta.",

        "body": "Some personal notes although I think this is a 9/10 at least, great job.\n\n1. Shaving? Might be too irritating for some people. Personally I’m not a huge fan of clean shaving armpits or private bits. Wahl Personal body trimmer with a short guard everywhere? Perfect. Save the razors for your face.\n\n2. Body deodorant? Try Thai Crystal and Cornstarch Deoderant Powder. \n\nWant it to be antibacterial? Get some aloe Vera gel and 5 drops of tea tree oil, mix that up, rub it on bits pits and everywhere else, let dry, then use your deoderant powder.\n\nHave BO and/or acne? Get some tea tree oil soap (I like Dr.Bronners) and some antiseptic soap (Hibiclens or the pharmacy generic equivalent) and mix them on an exfoliating cloth (Salux) until you have big foamy clouds of soap. Focus on pits, bits, skin folds, behind the ears, between the toes, back and ass, legs, any problem areas. Let the foam sit on your skin for at least 2 minutes, you might need to turn the shower off.\n\nHair: \nI need to wash my hair everyday, I just have a greasy scalp. Sometimes my hair feels clean and I just use conditioner only to refresh my scalp. Sometimes I use Cantu’s vinegar tea tree oil Shea scalp rejuvenator and the head and shoulders mask to deep clean/massage my scalp before a double shampoo and conditioner. Always double shampoo, the first time for the outside dirt the second time for a deep scalp scrub.\n\nStyling: If you are spending more than 15 mins daily on your hair w a heat tool, you either need to keep it short w frequent cuts, or look into chemical or protective styling. You can do a lot w perms and relaxers. Do you know what a du rag can do for you? Talk to a reputable hair dresser about your style and time goals.\n\nSweating:\nIt’s a normal beautiful thing. Do you have streams of sweat raining down from your body? You might want to talk to your doctor or ask for a referral to an endocrinologist about it, it could be a sign of horomone problems. Excessive sweating can be fixed with Botox injections, and it’s good to know your body and talk to your doctor about your comfort and expectations about your body.\n\nJason Tea Tree oil deodorant, crystal deodorants, any deodorant that performs well for you is great. Antiseptic soap, tea tree oil mixed w aloe or lotion on pits and bits, cornstarch based powders are all good for controlling odor in a natural way. Again, speak to your doctor if you need more options or opinions as to what you should expect from your body.\n\nGrease: Clay. Azteca Secret. Mix w water to form a paste. Add some tea tree oil if you have problem skin 5 drops. Paint a nice thick layer across your face and body. Pay $200 for this treatment in a spa. Or have fun at home. Let it dry and then remove with warm water and a wash cloth. Once a week or every two weeks, this kills grease. Works on hair and scalp too. Do not use on open wounds.\n\nAlso, consider powder. There are many silk and rice powders that are completely transparent and really give a polished look. Look for “blotting” “anti-shine” there are many made for men. Blotting papers work well too.\n\nLe Junk:\nTrimming hair works great. Antiseptic+ tea tree oil soap is key, get all up in there. Tea tree and lotion/aloe Vera is key. Cornstarch powder. Check your folds wrinkles and creases every time, and thoroughly. Get a bidet. Get a stack of wash cloths and swab the deck w water after a long day or before bed if you don’t shower. Always bathe within 2 hours of sexy time even if you just showered. \n\nFeet:\n40% urea cream with socks, leave it on at work or at night. Chemically exfoliates rough cracked skin, after a month or three of regular use you will have baby skin. This stuff works really well for ingrown hairs and rough bumpy skin too.\n\nSo TLDR:\nHair Trimmer, Tea Tree Oil, cornstarch powder, aloe Vera gel, antiseptic soap, clay, and urea cream can change your life.",

Your suggestions are relatively simple to find, collect, understand and put in practice, BUT when nobody teaches you the basics in life, these are precious.

I guess in a cold country (colder than mine at least) that's a bit more difficult than here (Italy), so I'd like to ask you how you do that.\n\nHave a good weekend and stay safe, good sir.",

But atleast 80% of these “Tret ruined my skin” “feeling so hopeless” posts are downright ridiculous. \n\nYou see their routines and they are just plain stupid. Why would you put on tretinoin- one of the most drying cream/formulation for your skin and literally not put any moisturizer at all. Yes if you are an oily skin girly-you still NEED to put a moisturizer. Try a light/gel one if it suits you. Tretinoin leads to major dryness and dehydration and your skin needs a lot of pampering to counter that. Please provide your parching skin some hydration and it will be less inflamed and calm down. \n\nCountless people with experience have already suggested to go slow with actives and preferably not use it at all. Yet i see people using glycolic acid and salicylic acid everyday! Sometimes without putting any moisturizer even!! My, I pray for yalls skin. \n\nSeriously do proper PROPER research before you start and also consult a derm. Don’t just pick it up and start using it. It is very potent and if used incorrectly is sure to ruin your skin(permanently even). But your incorrect use may mislead other people and they might not use it or use it wrongly even! Please use your brains!!\n\nRant over.",

    "body": "\nTL;DR: Walmart allows marketplace sellers to use misleading images, and a high rating isn't worth bunk. \n\nI really thought I was getting a good deal from Walmart on a holy grail item, the Paula's Choice 2% salicylic acid liquid exfoliant, at 4 ounces for close to 20 USD. \n\nFirst red flag: This item retails for 50 USD at Sephora and is only slightly cheaper if you order direct from the manufacturer's website. \n\nWhat kills me is that the picture of the bottle is straight from the Paula's Choice website, which did more than anything else to convince me. Adding to that, I've lucked out similiar, but less-steep deals in the past with other legitimate brands (Dermalogica, COSRX, etc.). So I hit send on four of these babies... and the items that arrived were most certainly not what was pictured online. Peep the brand where \"Paula's Choice\" should be.\n\nThe only information I could find on Carvenchy is that it's a brand sold on Alibaba where related items are going for a few bucks each. \n\nI don't have high hopes, but I am going to attempt an in-store return at Walmart as I'm not feeling too keen on rolling the dice on such a blatant knock-off. If they won't refund, I'm set to lose a decent amount of money.\n\nAs a final note: After submitting a bad review on the website, I saw that one other reviewer recently had the same experience. All the other (very high!) ratings and older comments are for a piece of sportswear -- which, if I hadn't been too hasty and greedy to notice, would've been the second red flag. \n\nSo be skeptical out there, take your time, and don't get cocky -- or you'll end up with similar material for a post of your own. :(",

    "body": "I had a breakout from using an after sun gel. My skin was so sensitive it burned as I applied it. I have eczema and never had it on my face until now. The problems were dry patches, discoloration, pimples and tiny pustules of dead skin cells. So, I started researching ingredients that could work for me. While doing that I found out I had a broken skin barrier. My skin was reacting negatively to anything I put on it. And using the antibacterial soap totally dried out my skin. I started with the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cream-to-Foam cleanser for sensitive skin. At first I wanted the La-roche Posay Lipikar gentle face wash but that was out of my price range and I didn’t want to wait for the order to come in the mail. I found the Neutrogena one at Walmart. The main thing that attracted me to the wash was its inclusion of CICA (Cantella Asiatica) aka BarrierTechnology™ which is an extract that helps soothe the skin and moisturize. Next, I got vegetable-based glycerin in the first aid department at Walmart. I mixed one drop in with my regular moisturizer to leave my skin feeling soft. Glycerin also penetrates deep into the skin because the molecular size/shape is similar to water molecules. Next, is using a 2% salicylic acid cream I got from dollar tree (yes it actually works) 2-3 times a day on the affected areas. I did this for 4-5 days and saw amazing results. This got rid of the bumps and deep-seated painful acne that stayed under the skin. Lastly, I got the La Roche Possy Triple Repair Face & Body Moisturizer. This leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. So after all of that. Now I just use the Neutrogena cream to foam cleanser in the morning and at night then follow up with the La roche posay. I spot treat any white heads I see with the salicylic acid. I also started using the Black Girl Sunscreen kids version and it’s the only sunscreen that doesn’t hurt or cause reactions. \n\nThese photos were taken 9 days apart. \n\nTLDR: \nI had a breakout from over stripping my skin, had a reaction to an after-sun gel, and sunscreen. \n\nProducts used: \n-La Roche Posay Triple Repair Face & Body moisturizer. \n-Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cream-To-Foam Cleanser \n-Dollar Tree 2% Salicylic Acid Acne Spot Treatment \n-Vaseline \n-Vitamin E Oil \n\nRoutine Now: \nNeutrogena Cleanser 2x a day\nLa Roche Posay moisturizer 2x a day\nVaseline 2-3x a week at night \nBlack Girl Sunscreen as needed\nSalicylic Acid Acne Spot treatment as needed",

While I consider myself lucky for not having major breakouts, I am always on a hunt for a good acne remedy. \n\nMy current weapons when an acne visits my face are patches & spot treatments. So far 2 creams became a regular- I haven't tried other brands, TBH but I am already satisfied with these.\n\n\n●Lion Pair acne cream: This Jbeauty wonder is gaining popularity this days. What makes this cream unique is it contains IPPN (ibuprofen piconol) and antibacterial agent IPMP (isopropylmethylphenol). Those 2 really helps with redness & swelling! While it may not make the pimple disappear overnight, it helps with calming & making it less visible. If you are allergic to Ibuprofren, this may not be a good option, though.\n\n\n●Bioderm ointment: A classic. We all know the brand and it is a common sight sa pharmacies & drugstores. This one contains Zinc Oxide (yes, the sunscreen filter), Benzoic acid, Sulfur & Salicylic acid. This one helps shrinking acne overnight. Might be a good option for fungal acne since it contains sulfur. \n\nPrices:\n\n\n●Lion Pair acne cream: 370PHP IIRC correctly at the 🔵 app.\n\n\n●Bioderm ointment: 35PHP for 15g. Easily available online & on your neighborhood pharmacy.",

        "body": "Hi there! I can offer some guidance as I dealt with this myself and now my pores are virtually invisible. First, you need to double cleanse your skin to get rid of the sebaceous filaments in your pores. It will make all the difference! Use a pre-cleansing oil by rubbing it into dry skin at nighttime to remove dirt, oil, debris, sebaceous filaments, makeup and SPF. Massage it into dry skin for 60 seconds. Then wet your fingers and massage again for 10 seconds, focusing on the areas that are most clogged. Rinse and then wash your face with your face wash. I use DRMTLGY pre-cleansing oil and Philosophy Purity Made Simple. Your pores will be SO clean and won’t look nearly as large. The oil from the pre-cleansing oil binds to the oil in your pores and will be completely removed much better than face wash alone.\n\nNext you want to work on making sure your skin is properly hydrated and moisturized! The two are different from each other. Hydration refers to water retention in your skin (humectants), and moisturizing refers to the softening of the skin barrier with moisturizers and lotions (emollients). You can also take it a step further and use occlusives (facial oils) as a last step in your routine. Hyaluronic acid serum with vastly help with hydration and a good moisturizer to keep your skin soft and moisturized. By doing this regularly I’ve actually completely changed my skin type from oily to normal!\n\nNext you are going to want to work on the texture of your skin. Products like kojic acid, vitamin C serum, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, lactic acid, and TRETINOIN are going to lend you the best results. Make sure you aren’t loading too much into your skin upfront as you don’t want to combine AHAs with retinoids right away. Your skin has to get used to the products so start slowly. I recommend googling “skin cycling” to see how to incorporate exfoliation and retinol into a skincare routine and learn which products not to use with each other. The more you learn about how the skin functions, what ingredients target what skin concerns, and what works well together, the better your outcome will be.\n\nHere is a basic nighttime skincare routine:\n\n1. Double cleanse\n2. Toner\n3. Serums (Hyaluronic acid applied to damp skin) and vitamin C serum/azelaic acid in the AM)\n4. Eye cream\n5. Treatment (either exfoliating with AHAs/BHAs or retinoids)\n6. Moisturizer \n7. Facial oils\n\nAnother thing to consider is microneedling. It will basically force your skin to create collagen which will plump your skin and smooth out your pores and look much less textured. It can be pricey but it’s SO worth it. My before and after photos are uncanny… I also ingest collagen peptides every morning.\n\nYour skin will be night and day difference! Let us know how it goes :)",

Follow up with your skincare routine targeted for your specific issues. As for serums using a hyaluronic acid and a Niacinamide serum are a great pairing as well as a good moisturizer. Make sure the serums and or moisturizer are water based (they work best together) , it will help combat any oily-ness and won't leave the skin feeling greasy or heavy after. \n\nEdit: Also PLEASE NEVER SQUEEZE THEM, it ends up hurting your skin more than helping and can make pores even more enlarged, massage gently in circular motions around the nose to loosen them up and remove it without any irritation or roughness.",

The old guide has been archived [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nvg2scUcaZdH-wNFhUtQwhPM3cWU6PCiQQNOQp9C6I/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease don't comment or message me to add A, B, or C treatment - the writer only included those that he has worked with and saw results.\n\n^(Disclaimer: Although written by a board-certified dermatologist, this is not a substitute for any medical advice. Please visit your healthcare specialist.)\n\nHair loss is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Understanding its causes, treatments, and prevention methods can help you take control of your hair health. In this comprehensive guide, we will discuss various factors contributing to hair loss, different hair loss conditions, their effective treatments, and other steps you can take to maintain healthy hair.\n\n# What factors can cause hair loss?\n\n1. **Genetic Factors:** Hereditary hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is the most common cause of hair loss. It affects both men and women and is characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair.\n2. **Hormonal Imbalances:** Hormonal fluctuations due to pregnancy, menopause, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can lead to hair loss.\n3. **Nutritional Factors:** A balanced diet is crucial for hair health. Deficiencies in nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B vitamins can contribute to hair loss.\n4. **Medical Conditions:** Thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases like alopecia areata, and scalp infections can cause hair loss.\n5. **Medications and Treatments:** Certain medications and treatments, including chemotherapy, can lead to temporary or permanent hair loss.\n6. **Stress:** Both physical and emotional stress can cause hair loss by triggering telogen effluvium, a temporary hair-shedding condition.\n\n# Identifying your type of hair loss\n\nThere are many hair loss types, and knowing which one you have can be very beneficial when treating it.\n\nFirst, it's essential to understand the difference between androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness) and non-androgenetic alopecia (non-pattern hair loss).\n\nThe former affects men and women differently - men generally have a receding hairline at their temples, while women tend to experience general thinning throughout the scalp.\n\nThe latter includes rarer forms, such as alopecia totalis (total scalp baldness), alopecia universalis (total body baldness), and telogen effluvium (i.e. brief shedding after childbirth or major surgery).\n\n# How to treat your hair condition?\n\nThis is designed so you know the most effective treatments for each condition. This is by no means an exhaustive list, it's just a list of the most popular ones.\n\n# Receding hairline\n\nA receding hairline is a common condition that affects millions of men worldwide, typically caused by heredity, hormones, aging, and other factors. The condition usually appears in males between 30 and 40 years old.\n\n# Symptoms of a receding hairline include:\n\n* Thinning or balding on the top of the head\n* Widening part line and sparse hair on the temples\n* Itchy, flaky scalp\n* Patches of thicker, darker hair or bald spots near the back of the scalp where new hairs do not grow\n* Increased shedding from other parts of the body, such as eyebrows and eyelashes\n* Weaker or finer hair on the scalp leading to breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for a receding hairline:\n\n1. Essential oils: Natural treatment options like peppermint oil, rosemary oil, and lavender oil can help stimulate blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy scalp conditions. Massage these oils into the scalp twice daily for the best results.\n2. Minoxidil: This over-the-counter medication can be applied directly to the scalp to promote the growth of new hairs in areas affected by receding hairlines. Use minoxidil as directed for optimal results.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment: PRP therapy involves drawing a patient's blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting the platelets into the scalp. This treatment can promote hair growth but may be expensive and suitable only for some individuals.\n\n# Male Pattern Baldness (MPB):\n\nMale pattern baldness is a common form of hair loss among men caused by genetic and hormonal factors. It usually begins with the thinning of hair on the temples and crown of the head, resulting in a receding hairline or bald spots. In some cases, it can even lead to complete baldness.\n\n# Symptoms of male pattern baldness:\n\n* Gradual thinning of hair at the crown or top of the head\n* Receding hairline around the temples and a generally sparse appearance\n* Increased shedding\n* Excessive oiliness or dryness of the scalp\n* Irritation or inflammation\n* In advanced cases, bald spots may form on the scalp or forehead\n\n# Recommended treatments for male pattern baldness:\n\n1. Medications: Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are both available to treat male pattern baldness. Minoxidil can be applied directly to the scalp twice a day to promote hair growth, while finasteride is a pill that reduces the production of DHT, the hormone linked to male pattern baldness.\n2. Hair Transplants: Hair transplants involve removing healthy hair follicles from the back or sides of the head and implanting them into areas where hair has been lost. This surgical solution can be successful but costly and may not be suitable for everyone.\n3. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Alopecia Areata:\n\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face, and other parts of the body. The immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to hair loss in small, round patches.\n\n# Symptoms of alopecia areata (continued):\n\n* Sudden onset of one or more round, smooth patches of hair loss on the scalp or other body parts\n* The skin in these areas is usually not inflamed or scaly\n* Scaling and inflammation on the scalp\n* Dandruff-like flaking\n* Hair loss on other areas of the body, such as the beard or eyebrows\n* Sometimes, the affected area may have a burning or itchy sensation\n\n# Recommended treatments for alopecia areata:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroids: These medications help reduce inflammation in the scalp and promote hair regrowth. Intralesional corticosteroids may also be used for this purpose.\n2. Medications like minoxidil and anthralin can help promote hair regrowth in some individuals.\n3. Scalp-cooling caps or cold caps can be used to reduce inflammation and improve the effectiveness of topical corticosteroids.\n4. Immunotherapy: This treatment stimulates an immune response to promote hair regrowth and may be beneficial for some people with alopecia areata.\n\n# Telogen Effluvium:\n\nTelogen effluvium is a temporary increase in hair shedding caused by various factors, such as stress, illness, surgery, or significant weight loss. Hair shedding typically occurs 2-3 months after the triggering event and can last for several months before resolving.\n\n# Symptoms of telogen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid, noticeable thinning or shedding of scalp hair\n* Excessive amounts of hair in the shower drain or on pillows after sleeping\n* Small \"peach fuzz\" hairs on the scalp\n* Visible scalp through thinning hair\n* Itching, burning, or redness of the scalp\n* Loss of eyebrows or eyelashes in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for telogen effluvium:\n\n1. Address the underlying cause: Treat hormonal imbalances or nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to hair loss. This may involve taking medications or supplements to balance hormones and provide essential nutrients.\n2. Stress management: Practice relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation to help reduce stress levels.\n3. Medications: Prescription medications like minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia) can help reverse telogen effluvium by promoting hair growth.\n4. Hair transplant: In some cases, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair due to telogen effluvium. This involves removing healthy follicles from the back of the head and transplanting them to areas of thinning or baldness.\n5. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is recommended for early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including telogen effluvium. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n\n# Anagen Effluvium:\n\nAnagen effluvium is a type of hair loss caused by an interruption to the normal growth cycle of the hair follicle. This can occur when the cells producing new hairs are damaged or destroyed, leading to rapid hair shedding. Chemotherapy treatments, some medications, certain medical conditions, and nutritional deficiencies can trigger anagen effluvium.\n\n# Symptoms of anagen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid hair loss, usually within 2 to 4 weeks after the triggering event\n* Hair thinning, with a reduction in overall hair volume\n* Patches of baldness on the scalp or other areas of the body where hair is present\n* Brittle, easily broken hair\n* An itchy, scaly scalp or lesions on the scalp or other body areas with hair loss\n* Eyebrows and eyelashes may be affected in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for anagen effluvium:\n\n1. Minoxidil: This topical medication can be applied directly to the scalp to help stimulate hair growth and reduce hair loss.\n2. Steroid injections: Corticosteroid injections can help suppress scalp inflammation and promote hair regrowth.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: This treatment involves taking a blood sample from the patient and injecting it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth.\n4. Hair transplantation: For severe cases of anagen effluvium, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair. The hair follicles are taken from another area of the scalp and implanted in the affected area.\n5. Hair Nutrient Tablets by Scandinavian Biolabs: These multivitamins are enriched with essential nutrients like zinc, riboflavin, and other vitamins that support healthy hair growth.\n\n# Traction Alopecia:\n\nTraction alopecia is hair loss caused by prolonged, constant tension on the scalp. It can occur from hairstyles that pull too tightly on the follicles, such as tight buns, braids, and ponytails. Traction alopecia is commonly seen in African Americans, but anyone can be affected by it.\n\n# Symptoms of traction alopecia:\n\n* Thinning hair and bald patches in areas repeatedly exposed to tight hairstyles\n* Tenderness or burning sensations on the scalp and itching\n* Inflammation or open sores (known as folliculitis) due to excessive tension placed on the hair follicles\n* Hair loss may spread beyond the initial area of damage, and other scalp issues, such as scarring or infections, may occur\n\n# Recommended treatments for traction alopecia:\n\n1. Removal of the cause: Avoid activities that cause excess tension on the scalp, such as tight hairstyles or clips. Wearing protective hairstyles, like loose braids or ponytails, can help prevent traction alopecia from reoccurring.\n2. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including traction alopecia. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n3. Essential oil massage: Massaging the scalp with essential oils like lavender and rosemary can help stimulate hair growth. Alternatively, try a [hair protection oil](https://scandinavianbiolabs.com/products/hair-protection-oil) – a blend of essential and beneficial oils designed to revitalize your hair.\n4. Maintain a healthy diet: Ensuring a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle can improve the overall health of the scalp and hair. If left untreated, traction alopecia can lead to permanent baldness.\n\n# Scalp Psoriasis\n\nScalp psoriasis is a prevalent skin condition that affects millions of people globally. It is characterized by red, scaly patches on the scalp, leading to itching, burning, discomfort, and even hair loss. By understanding the symptoms and recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis, you can better manage this condition and reduce its impact on your hair health.\n\n# Symptoms of scalp psoriasis:\n\nDepending on the severity, symptoms of scalp psoriasis can vary. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Itchy, scaly patches on the scalp\n* Redness and inflammation\n* Thick, silvery scales or plaques that may appear as large patches\n* Hair loss in patchy areas\n* Burning or soreness\n* Stiffness in the scalp\n* Flaking skin that may appear on clothes or furniture\n\n# Recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis:\n\n1. Topical medications: corticosteroids, calcipotriol, coal tar products, dithranol, and salicylic acid.\n2. Oral or injected medications: to control inflammation and reduce scaling.\n3. Light therapy: beneficial for scalp psoriasis alone or combined with topical medications.\n4. Lifestyle changes: stress reduction, diet improvement, and regular exercise to reduce flare-ups.\n5. Self-care measures: avoid scratching the scalp, and use gentle shampoos designed for scalp psoriasis.\n\n# Trichotillomania\n\nTrichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is a psychological condition marked by a recurrent urge to pull out one's hair. This behavior can lead to noticeable hair thinning, patchy baldness, or even complete hair loss in severe cases.\n\n# Symptoms of trichotillomania\n\nCommon symptoms associated with trichotillomania include:\n\n* Obsessive thoughts or urges to pull out hair\n* Feelings of tension before and relief after hair-pulling\n* Frequent playing with, twirling, or rubbing pulled-out hair\n* Inability to resist hair-pulling in specific situations or when experiencing certain emotions\n* Noticeable bald patches on the scalp and other areas of the body\n* Emotional distress related to hair-pulling, such as guilt or shame\n* Excessive grooming behaviors leading to hair loss, such as over-combing or brushing\n* Feelings of satisfaction when looking at pulled-out hair\n* Using techniques to disguise bald patches, such as wearing hats or frequently changing hairstyles\n\n# Recommended treatments for trichotillomania\n\n1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): helps identify and modify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contributing to hair-pulling urges.\n2. Medications: antidepressants or antipsychotics to reduce hair-pulling urges and relieve symptoms.\n3. Habit Reversal Training (HRT): a type of CBT that helps identify and modify hair-pulling behaviors.\n4. Support Groups: provide a safe place to share experiences, build coping skills, and reduce stigma.\n\n# Female Pattern Baldness\n\nFemale pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia, is a common type of hair loss affecting millions of women worldwide. It usually begins in the 40s and can continue until menopause. The primary cause is an excess of androgens or male hormones, which causes hair follicles to shrink, leading to thinning hair on the scalp.\n\n# Symptoms of female pattern baldness\n\nCommon signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Gradual thinning on top of the head\n* Receding hairline, especially at temples\n* Widening of the center hair part\n* Increased hair shedding on a pillow in the morning\n* An overall decrease in scalp coverage\n* Visible bald patches (in advanced cases)\n* Hair shedding or breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for female pattern baldness\n\n1. Medications: Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are commonly used to treat female pattern baldness. Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), while minoxidil promotes hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp.\n2. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a non-invasive treatment shown to reduce hair loss and promote new hair growth in some women. It uses low-intensity lasers to stimulate the scalp, increasing circulation and encouraging follicles to enter the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle.\n3. Hair Transplant Surgery: This procedure involves transplanting healthy hair from an area of the scalp with thicker hair to balding areas. The transplanted hairs will grow naturally in the new location, providing a permanent solution to female pattern baldness.\n4. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Hairline Recession & Thinning at The Crown\n\nHairline recession and thinning at the crown can be distressing for many people, especially those who had a full head of hair in their younger years. This issue affects both men and women but is more common in men.\n\n# Symptoms of hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n* Widening of the central and frontal hair part line\n* Visible scalp on forehead, temples, or crown areas\n* Reduced amount of hairs in specific areas\n* An overall decrease in fullness and body of hair along the parting line\n* Widening of the scalp line with a receding hairline\n* Hair loss in patches, mainly on the crown area\n* Breakage or shedding hairs along the parting lines or around the crown area\n\n# Recommended treatments for hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n1. Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a topical medication applied directly to the scalp, available in over-the-counter and prescription formulas. It stimulates hair growth and makes existing hairs stronger and thicker.\n2. Finasteride: This medication is taken orally, usually once a day, and works to block the production of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a significant contributing factor in male pattern baldness.\n3. Platelet-rich Plasma Therapy: Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) is a treatment that uses the patient's blood to stimulate hair growth. It injects the patient's plasma, containing high platelets and other healing factors, directly into the scalp.\n4. Hair Transplant: A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves transferring hair follicles from one part of the scalp to another. It can treat hairline recession and thinning at the crown.\n5. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a newer form of treatment that uses light energy to stimulate hair growth. The lasers are typically painless and can treat both men and women experiencing hair loss.",

The problem is always inside the body . Everything that is visible outside is only a symptom. Firstly review your lifestyle and cut all the unnecessary medications. Then start doing sports ( any activity like yoga or pilates will do , walk more )Drink more water , sleep well , calm down your nerves. You need herb medications to bust your blood flow , to increase metabolism. Coconut oil mixed with ginger or red pepper or turmeric will only make your hair greasy and your scalp itchy . I tried it believe me . Nicotinic acid works a little  because it makes your blood flow betterIts  . It’s never a bad idea to consult a professional therapist . He can give individual recommendations which will work for you. For example Ashvagandha and Horsetail worked well for me . But if doesn’t mean that it will suit your dosha type.  I met my Ayurvedic doctor when traveled to New Delhi before the pandemic. Currently he consults online on Alveda.life",

Scalp Micropigmentation is a very different procedure and outcome from a traditional tattoo, and it's very important to point out the distinction. For example, going to a tattoo parlor and requesting an artist there that has not been trained in SMP if you are looking for them to recreate what looks like buzzed hair follicles, often ends in disaster. Scalp Micropigmentation is a completely different process, uses different tools and techniques, different pigments, etc. I just want to make sure that everyone viewing your wonderful list of resources knows the difference. I am a certified SMP practitioner, so please feel free to ask me any questions. You can also get a lot of information from my site at https://greatscalp.com. Thank you.",

I have these salicylic acid wipes that are used to get rid of blackheads and help with acne. BUT! I learned that salicylic can also kill the bacteria responsible for body odor. I’ve been wiping my pits with them every other night and seriously they don’t smell at all. So on those days I don’t have time to shower or forget deodorant, that’s one less thing I have to worry about people noticing!\n\nAny shortcuts we can take to feeling more human are worth sharing, so I thought I would do so! \n\nTL,DR: wipe your pits every other day  with salicylic acid to keep them fresh without having to use deodorant.",

    "body": "Please ignore my goofy expressions.\n\nEight years ago, I took the first photo on the left and vowed to never raise my eyebrows again because I thought I looked haggard and old at the ripe age of 19. Five years ago, a year after a long summer spent in the Greek sun, I took the second photo on the left and swore I'd be more consistent with sunscreen and take up a more serious skincare routine. Four years ago I found Dr. Dray and actually started looking into what I put on my skin.\n\nOnce upon a time I imagined my best skin/hair/appearance days were all behind me. I know that sounds dramatic for a 26 year old.... but while I have some new melasma and spots but I'd take my 26 year old skin over my 19 and 21 year old skin. Don't underestimate the power of consistency. And sunscreen!!!\n\nCurrent routine: \n\nAM\nRinse\nVitamin C (was using Derm E, but ran out and ordered timeless but the order got lost or something so I'm ordering cosrx) or hyaluronic acid (Vichy ATM but wouldn't repurchase, TO's is just as good) - vitamin c is a recent addition to my routine \nPaulas Choice Omega + complex moisturiser (on my second bottle - sits well under sunscreen)\nSPF - varies. Lately I've been layering hero cosmetics force shield under australian gold tinted which is too dark for me. My favorite for a really long time was cotz sensitive mixed with cotz flawless tinted but I wanted to switch it up. For concealer I use it cosmetics cc cream with spf 50 which I was using for a really long time as spf but decided it was too heavy.\n\nPM\nCleansing balm - recently, Clean it zero nourishing makeup removing balm which I prefer to clinique take the day off that I used forever\nCleanser - varies by the day. I have a lot of Korean face washes my MIL brings me back when she visits and I'm not really picky, I'm just trying to use them up. Tonymoly snail gold cleanser is good, I love the aveeno calm and restore, LRP lipikar cleanser as well as peach slices salicylic acid wash occasionally.\n I immediately follow this up by either cosrx snail mucin or hyaluronic acid (recently Vichy but usually TO) Serums - depending on how my skin is feeling I rotate between TO peptide & HA, TO niacinimide, versed overnight rescue and cosrx aha/bha \nMoisturizer - again, I have a bunch from Korea. Currently using winage snail cream or charmzone 152 noble cream. I follow this up with a light layer of LRP cicaplast balm and pat on a layer of pure jojoba oil. \nSpot treatment - cerave acne treatment and afrin for redness (newly adopted). For a while I was using PCA pigment gel but I used it all over my face instead of just to melasma and made my spots worse 🙃\n\nThis routine looks insane but I have a problem with splurging on skincare because I have no other hobbies and ~I'm working on it and also working on using what I already have.\n\nOther stuff that helped: not raising eyebrows while doing random activities like blow drying my hair. It was a serious problem lol. I've been on BCP since I was 16. I try to avoid hanging out in the sun too much even with sunscreen. I also ditched foundation with SPF for tinted sunscreen.",

    "body": "This post is the culmination of over a decade of research, testing, and persistence in advancing KP treatments and our understanding of this condition. Like so many of you, I have met with countless dermatologists across the country and sunk significant money into trying to effectively treat this condition. I wholeheartedly believe that this theory and the treatments I have proposed are the most effective and up to date options for reducing the severity of Keratosis Pilaris. \n\nKeratosis Pilaris is not caused by keratin buildup in the skin. Keratin buildup around the follicle is one of the last symptoms to develop in a series of cascading symptoms.\n\nHi everyone- my name is Devin Beaubien (u/Poem\\_KP) and I moderate the r/keratosis subreddit. \n\nI've been researching Keratosis Pilaris and trying to understand what the condition is, why I have it, and how I could improve my situation for well over a decade. I've been pushing harder than ever on this research since my son developed KP as a toddler that was much more severe than mine was at the same age. In these past 5 years I believe I’ve discovered and developed a highly effective U.S. Patent Pending treatment to target the underlying barrier defects and inflammation/redness of KP. This was done through extensive testing and research, first by myself in a home-based lab, and then through partnering with a commercial R&D lab that helped me to formalize what I had developed. \n\nI have compiled all of my extensive research and cited sources into the following article on my website here: [https://smoothkp.com/blogs/news/keratosis-pilaris-pathology-a-working-theory](https://smoothkp.com/blogs/news/keratosis-pilaris-pathology-a-working-theory)\n\nThis post will attempt to summarize my proposal on the pathology of KP, treatment options, and why KP is such a misunderstood skin condition. At the time of posting, I believe that this KP theory is the most comprehensive research article ever compiled on Keratosis Pilaris. \n\nIn the simplest terms, Keratosis Pilaris is a very common skin condition that begins with a single underlying root cause. That root cause is located in the epithelial skin barrier around the hair follicle where the barrier has cellular “gaps” (for lack of a better term) that allow moisture to escape and bacteria and allergens to pass into the skin, triggering an immune response. This barrier abnormality occurs well before keratin begins forming in the follicle. \n\nThere are multiple KP symptoms that build on top of one another. From my research they follow this pattern:\n\n1. Skin cells fail to secrete lipids during maturation\n2. Skin barrier around the follicle is compromised\n3. Inflammation develops\n4. Sebaceous glands shrink and atrophy\n5. Hair follicles become brittle and curled\n6. Keratin accumulates in the follicle (creating the bumps)\n7. When inflammation recedes from the follicle it leaves behind post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\nNearly all treatments for KP are attempting to improve the texture of KP by chemically exfoliating the keratin buildup in the follicle (6), but since they do not adequately address all of the barrier issues or sebaceous gland shrinkage, the best results that you can expect to achieve are going to be texture improvements. Applying glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, and/or retinol to a compromised skin barrier is not going to do much for improving redness and inflammation. In fact it may very well do the opposite. \n\nWhile moisturizing the skin will help soften and reduce some dryness around the follicles, it’s a losing battle if your skin is not producing enough sebum (skin oil) to moisturize and protect your follicles. \n\nThis next part is going to be complicated and represents the bulk of my research on KP. What I cover here is delved into with much more depth in the article I linked at the beginning (and end) of this post. \n\nI theorize that the barrier issues we see in KP are the direct result of deficient IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1) levels in skin tissue, combined with genetic mutations of Insulin growth factor receptors and the underlying cellular signaling pathways that regulate how skin cells mature and differentiate as they move through the layers of the skin. \n\nConsider the following: \n\n* Studies testing IGF-1 inhibition result in a disrupted epidermis that looks strikingly like the barrier disruption seen in KP.\n* IGF-1 and its effects on skin cells directly regulate skin cell maturation as the cells travel through the skin. Deficiency in IGF-1 and:or mutations in Insulin receptors would directly affect the skin cell as it differentiates and secretes lipids during the formation of the skin barrier around the SC-SG interface, which is exactly where we see barrier issues appearing in KP.\n* This study identified mutation of cellular pathways (triggered by IGF-1) resulting in the development of KP: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/)\n* IGF-1 levels are lowest in children and steadily increase as you age, correlating with how we see KP improve in some children as they age\n* IGF-1 levels raise while we sleep, with sleep being crucial to hormone production. This correlates with people reporting that their KP appears less severe in the mornings upon waking.\n* IGF-1 levels decrease and sebaceous glands are atrophied when undergoing Isotretinoin (Accutane) treatment. This correlates with the numerous reports we’ve seen in r/keratosis of people experiencing increased severity of KP after taking Accutane. \n* IGF-1 levels are affected by pregnancy during increased estrogen production and additional hormonal factors. This correlates with reports of KP severity changes during and post pregnancy.\n* PCOS and other conditions that affect insulin resistance also correlate with increased likelihood of KP development.\n* Diets that contain high glycemic foods (rapidly digested carbohydrates) and milk proteins can effect insulin resistance, providing a potential link for some between diet and KP that so often is reported in r/keratosis\n* Keratosis pilaris can result from Dupilumab for the treatment of bronchial asthma. IGF-2 stimulates the secretion of the Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 by 40-70%, while Dupilumab has been shown to inhibit the Th2 pathway. This reinforces the assertion that mutations in this cellular pathway and its signaling are direct causes in the pathology of KP.\n* KP prevalence correlates with obesity, which in turn correlates with insulin resistance. \n* IGF-1 is also responsible for the regulation of lipogenesis, which is thought to occur through IGF-1’s effects on 5α-Reductase and the enzymatic process responsible for converting testosterone into DHT, which stimulates sebocyte proliferation. IGF-1 effective regulates sebum production in the skin.\n\nI could continue but at this point I think you are probably seeing the same patterns I see. \n\nIGF-1 is also partially responsible for inhibiting inflammation via stimulation of IL-10 production which I believe is important for people suffering from KPRF, a subtype of KP affecting the face with visible redness and flushing of the cheeks. \n\nSo to summarize, IGF-1 and its related cellular pathways are connected directly or is one step removed from every symptom experienced by those with KP. Deficiency in IGF-1 and IR mutation also correlates with all of the events that are known to affect KP development and severity. \n\nCoincidence? I think not! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac89j3giowle1.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4247f2ee20e5cb95462a0e6c6d4b70d1f37c851\n\nSo the big question is how do we improve IGF-1 bioavailability in skin tissue to prevent barrier issues from forming, thereby preventing KP symptoms?\n\nFor this, I believe I have a very compelling answer. \n\nHere is my arm with severe KP before and after applying this treatment for stimulating IGF-1 production in my skin through a topical lotion I developed:\n\n[My arm after 12 weeks of continued twice daily application of topical RK & Indirubin ](https://preview.redd.it/3qo9em8anwle1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8b0132e5481b44f870e74948fb20aa75f6afdc6)\n\nInitially in my research I was testing multiple compounds on my skin to determine their effectiveness on my KP. I finally settled on two specific compounds:\n\n**Raspberry Ketone:** The aromatic compound in red raspberries has been studied for topical application and has been shown to stimulate significant IGF-1 production in skin tissue through sensory neuron activation.\n\n**Indirubin (Indigo Naturalis):** An anti inflammatory that reduces keratinocyte proliferation and cytokine production in the skin. \n\nBy combining these ingredients into a jojoba oil base (which is a plant extracted oil that is  chemically similar to human sebum) I believe I have created the most effective skincare topical for regulating Keratosis Pilaris. This topical solution was also iterated on to balance pH and add the lowest effective concentration of lactic acid to help turn over skin cells without irritation, reducing pigmentation that has occurred due to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. \n\nLike I said in the beginning of this post, I wholeheartedly believe that this theory and the treatments I have proposed are the most effective and up to date options for reducing the severity of Keratosis Pilaris. I have seen incredible results in my own KP and well as my son’s. I have also shared this treatment with a number of people through informal product trials and have received amazing feedback. No other treatment like this has existed until today, because no other KP treatments/products have been focused on anything except exfoliation and skin cell turnover. \n\nPlease take some time to dive into my research and see the evidence for yourself. I’d love to see what everyone thinks of this passion project, it's taken a lot of energy to get here and I am very excited to be sharing all of this with you! Thank you so much for reading!\n\n**TL;DR:** I believe I connected the dots, identified the root cause of Keratosis Pilaris and developed a solution that corrects all of the cascading symptoms of KP. I have compiled all cited sources into a blog I published [HERE](https://smoothkp.com/blogs/news/keratosis-pilaris-pathology-a-working-theory) and summarized the findings on this webpage [HERE](https://smoothkp.com/pages/learn)\n\nUPDATE: All of you that have decided to try out this lotion, first of all thank you for taking a chance on me and this project 🙏 and secondly all orders sent in this past Friday + this Weekend will be dropped off at USPS Monday (tomorrow) morning. I am anxiously awaiting everyone’s feedback on how their KP responds to this lotion ❤️\n\nUPDATE 2: Still waiting on a couple of items to come through for international shipping! There were a couple of unseen hurdles to get through, waiting on approval from payment providers in key markets, but as soon as that goes through we will be available in 150+ countries. Sorry for the delay- appreciate the patience 🙏\n\nUPDATE 3: For all that showed interest outside of the USA- International shipping is available if you want to try out this theory 👍",

I am 50 yo and completed 4 or 5 rounds of accutane since my college years for mild/moderate cystic acne. Each round helped  for 1-2 years but acne always returned. Interesting, 6 months prior to onset of my current condition I had initiated low dose, long-term Accutane therapy during which time my current condition hit me with a ton of bricks. I quit Accutane and have been trying to resolve this with every possible solution for the last several years with no change.\n\nA couple of recent developments of interest : I recently bought a black light out of curiosity to see if there would be any fluorescence that might give a clue to what is happening to my skin. I was shocked to see bright, orange/pink fluorescent spots in each keratin plug. I learned that this is characteristic of a sub type of C acnes bacteria that is associated with or causes acne (technically an imbalance of this subtype vs the c. acnes subtype in normal skin flora- the ‘normal’ type does not fluoresce ). how this is possible at my age I have no idea! \n\nAlso, around the same time I tried a product with 6% resorcinol and was shocked by its effectiveness. It completely obliterated the rough, sandpaper like layer of skin- much better than urea or any of the many other acids/ moisturizers I’ve tried over the years. However, it did not resolve the underlying issue of follicular keratin proliferation and in some sense has exacerbated the problem because the inflamed keratin spots are closer to the surface now.\n\nAnyway, if you got this far, thank you for reading. I am very curious to know how my experience fits with your theory!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for taking the time to share your research in this detail! I'm taking notes 😊  \n\nI've also been wondering whether KP is improved by decreasing inflammation and allowing the skin barrier to repair itself. Because I have a few skin conditions in addition to KP (namely, seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea) and they have driven me through years of painful trial and error of products from head to toe. What cleared the seborrheic dermatitis tended to irritate my KP and rosacea, but what was gentle enough to calm down my KP and rosacea tended to flare up my seborrheic dermatitis. It's a Catch-22.  \n\nSo the solution I've converged on is an avoidance approach. I start with \"Malassezia safe\" products, and add more filters for ingredients that I've observed to cause skin barrier disruption or inflammation. These are primarily certain surfactants and topical actives (which are frustratingly pervasive on the market), plus a few contact allergens.  \n\nIt hasn't cured my KP as I still have sporadic keratin plugs on my arms. But it vastly calms down the follicles and it's not as widespread as it used to be. It's there if I look at it, but I no longer have itching and inflammation stealing my attention, which was important for quality of life with these already frustrating other conditions.",

I have trouble getting close to people because I feel like they’re staring at my pores, especially on my nose and forehead. I feel super uncomfortable even posting these pics here.\n\nI know pore size and skin texture is largely genetic, but I feel like I’m doing the absolute bare minimum for my skin which makes me a bit hopeful that putting in more time and effort can help a lot. I’ll never have perfect skin, but any improvement will help!\n\nMy routine is very minimal, I wash my face every morning in the shower with Cetaphil Daily Cleanser and then I use Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion. That’s it, I don’t even wash my face at night (which I know I should!)\n\nSometimes I use oil blotting paper around the afternoon because my glasses keep sliding down my nose, but that’s only every so often.\n\nReading these skincare subs can be stressful because there are so many products out there and differing opinions, which is why I’m posting here. I feel like something with salicylic acid could help, or some kind of toner? I also know I need to wash my face at night too, but I wanna make sure I’m using the right kind of products first.\n\nPlease, any help or advice with my skin texture would be greatly greatly appreciated!

I was using an oil cleanser, a gel cleaner, tazarotene, plus 20% medical grade salicylic acid every other day, and had tried basically everything. Nothing helped. He basically said my sebaceous glands are overactive, and started me on accutane. By day 15 it was like a night/day difference, and I don’t make grease. The full treatment of 6 months permanently shrinks the sebaceous glands, so effects are lasting. \n\nHowever this was my experience, and the cause for our large pore size may not be the same. But it’s something I never would have thought about and wish I did earlier. So just  thought you may want to discuss with a professional.",

        "body": "If you zoom in closer you can see most of the pores have a small dot/head that is built up excess sebum aka clogged pore. Before using any retinols you should focus on clearing out the pores first by double cleansing/exfoliation. Look up “oil cleansing” on YouTube, there’s lots of shorts of people massaging their faces for a couple minutes and see all the gunk quite literally fall out. Always follow up with a gentle foam cleanser to wash the oil off your face. Cleaning out the pores will make a huge difference in their appearance alone.\n\nYou can also incorporate BHAs such as salicylic acid which helps further clean out pores and is a great exfoliant. Always start slow with any active ingredients (once a week and build your way up to 2-3x if your skin can handle it). Clay masks with charcoal can also help absorb excess oils. \n\nPore size is mostly determined by how much oil your skin produces, the oilier the bigger. However, there’s a difference between your normal pores and the enlarged pores that are mostly on your t-zone, so you can definitely improve the appearance. It’ll take time, patience and consistency! Just like during weightloss, your skin will lose its elasticity and you need to build muscle to help firm and tone your body. Your pores function the same way. With consistent/gentle care your pores will get better!",

The Ordinary has good affordable versions. Make sure to wear sunscreen if you’re going out during the day! The vit a or c should be before bed.\n\nAdd an oil to your routine if you haven’t. Just a drop or two mixed into the moisturizer.\n\nDon’t exfoliate your face. Maybe a chemical exfoliant once a month. Potentially add a mild salicylic acid and/or toner during the day - no acid or toner at the same time as antioxidants (vit a/c)! Don’t use Niacinamide at the same time as Vit C. (Vit A is safe with Niacinamide. Also, generally, *use Niacinamide*.)\n\nBe gentle on your face while washing and applying products. The skin needs time to *heal*.\n\nDrink enough water, don’t smoke, sleep enough, take vitamins, don’t eat too unhealthy. These affect a lot and are easily underestimated.\n\n(I didn’t read your post tbh, I’m at work but typing discretely in my lap. Lol)\n\n———\n\nEdit: My Routine: (all from The Ordinary)\n\nEarly: squalane cleanser while dry, foaming cleanser while wet. Then hyaluronic acid mixed with niacinamide, under eye serum, dry for a minute. A drop of oil mixed into beta-glucan moisturizer. (It’s a clear gel that is the most comfortable/matte for me.)\n\nBefore bed: foaming cleanser, hyaluronic acid (mixed with niacinamide if it’s a retinol day), under eye serum, dry for a minute or two. Then I either use the Vit C serum or the Retinol (I mix the newer thick yellow retinol paste with ‘Resverotrol and Ferulic Acid’, which is just another simple antioxidant that is cheap and helps thin the yellow paste so I can spread it better. It’s safe to mix and helps skin texture.) Then I use the moisturizer *without* oil since the antioxidants are already oily enough.\n\nI also use their lash/brow serum cuz mine were getting concerningly thin and short. Now my lashes are superb, which makes my eyes look a lot better. And my brows look a lot better. I do that last.",

Pay attention to how closely the camera or mirror is to you when you think this. You look great even if it doesn't feel like it. \n\nSecond, yes, genetics are huge here, and you are not at fault or taking poor care of your skin, in fact it looks really healthy! but there is a way to feel better and reduce oil production. \n\nIt will sound counterproductive, but try to reduce the oil blot paper use. \n\nStripping your skin of oils is making it produce more oils. I also made this error, and it sucked correcting course. Have you noticed yet the more you try to reduce/remove oil, the harder it is to manage? \n\nWith very clean hands, take a drop of oil [yes, that little] and try to evenly dab it onto freshly washed skin [especially in the oily large pore zones] before you put on your moisturizer. \n\nYou don't want to trap debri into your pores accidentally, so gently washing with an oil based cleanser [or a few drops of face oil] before your normal cleanser with help prevent pore clogging. \n\nTo be honest, all you need is to add oil into your face care since your skin is very healthy. The oil blot papers are indicative that your pores are overcompensating. \n\nIt will be rough for a week or two, and you might get mild acne if something gets clogged into your pores or due to a pH change in your skin after a routine change, but I can personally attest that the only thing that stopped rampant over production of oils was to take charge of adding it first in a healthy, clean manner. \n\nLastly, pores will slightly look larger as you age. This is normal simply because our skin is slightly looser than when we were teens. \n\nUse bio-oil. It is cheap and affordable but perfect for the skin and actually a pretty well-vetted and older product. Often advertized for scarring. \n\nI can send you links if you want to be sure you have the right thing, but it is sold in most stores [at least online] now and even amazon. \n\nI do not recommend trying to eliminate oil production or using even harsher products like acutane! \n\nTldr: Stripping your skin of oils is making it produce more oils. Don't fall into the trap. \n\nSincerely, \n a former grease ball.",

    "body": "hi guys- \ni'm a huge fan of this subreddit and I realized today that I've got something to contribute! I'm a huge skincare buff and over the past 10 years my acne plagued skin has gotten me quite knowledgable about skincare-- and thanks to great sites like makeupalley.com also aware of some great (cheap) \"cheats\", aka beauty products in everyday cheaper items. Here are my favorite:\n\n1. Aspirin, used as mask or facewash (I leave it on while I brush twice a day, my skins never looked better)\nI dab water on a few tablets, wait for them to get damp and powdery and spread them upon damp skin. This seriously makes clogged pores better in about 10 minutes, in all my years an $1000s of bottles of skin stuff I have NEVER FOUND ANYTHING THAT WORKS BETTER FOR MY OILY/ACNE SKIN. \n\nit's main ingredient is salicylic acid (aka the same stuff in all that stuff in the acne section of the store) \n\nbest part? It's lke 6 bucks for a whole bottle (that will last you a really long time). \n\n2. Jojoba oil\nIt can be pricey (relatively) but 2 drops is enough to moisturize my oilier skin for a whole day, doesn't clog pores, lasts about a year. \n\nno parabens and all that other stuff. Only one ingredient. \n\nprice: $9\n\n\n3. This is a recent find, and don't laugh, but Monistat \"gel to powder\" chafing stuff (yes for your vag)\n\nIt's main ingredients are the same as Smashbox's $35 primer. Makes makeup look great on, and is like $9. I'm down to put vag cream on my face to save me $25. \n\n\nI have to note that I also use differin (a prescription), which is about $20 every 5 months, but I have insurance. \n\nIf anyone else has other \"cheats\", I would love to hear! \n\nPS remember never to put baking soda, lemon juice and other extreme PH \"home remedies\" on your skin!",

Buy a tiny bit of pure powder online for like 10 bucks or less and use it to make a night serum, it seriously works and makes my face much smoother and filled out my pimple crater. Do not apply it if you're planning to go out because vitamin c will make your skin sensitive to sun exposure . I mainly use it as a night serum. \n\n* Use a microfiber towel to cleanse your face after your makeup cleanser. Use warm water and gentle circular motions for the best effect. Never tug up or down on your skin when applying lotion or other stuff to your face, use a gentle patting motion. \n\n* Buy and use sunscreen religiously so that you have good skin and look better when you're old. Sun exposure majorly damages and ages your skin. Physical blocker type sunscreen that contain a mix of zinc oxide and titanium oxide work the best to block out wide spectrum UVA and UVB rays although some people complain that they leave a white cast or is hard to blend. \n\n* Oatmeal masks are awesome, makes your skin baby smooth. Raw honey masks are moisturizing, as are raw yogurt and cucumber masks due to the lactic acid. Clay masks are good for exfoliating. \n\n* Grapeseed oil(for skin repair) and rose hip oil(for ageing skin and neck). I used jojoba oil before but switched to these 2 oils because they had more positive effects on my skin. \n\n* Put serums, moisturizers, sunscreen, foundation on your neck! I see so many beautiful women with perfect makeup whose skintone on their necks plain don't match. Lots of women with smooth skinned faces but wrinkly necks.",

    "body": "Feel free to share your lazy girl habits! \n\nWhen I’m lazy I’ll just rub my brushes with a make up wipe and or micellar water and wash cloth to post pone washing my brushes a few days. \n\nI’ll use a dermaplan razor for my brow tails instead of plucking them \n\nI use my electric foot file every other time I shower instead of every time if I’m feeling lazy. (Follow up with vaelsine and the perfume I’m wearing and oooof softest beautiful smelling feet ever!!) \n\nI track my hair washing schedule with “hair track” so if I don’t feel like washing my hair I’ll check my app to see when I washed it (I have serb dermatitis on my scalp and my derm wants me wash every other day). I alternate what I shampoo I use. I alternate between a salicylic acid, ketoconazole shampoo, tea tree, moisturizing shampoo and a clarifying shampoo. The salicylic acid and ketoconazole need to be left on a minimum of 5 minutes and if I double cleanse it sucks. But I had a thinning spot and following my methods I’ve grown hair back! I also use glycolic\nAcid on my scalp toooo\n\nI’ll update with the more lazy things I do lmao. \n\nIt’s like a sleep over where we can share :)\n\nEdit: I want to add some more things I do lmao. \n\nMy hair on my thighs are non existent and I shave my legs on Friday so if in a pinch I’ll shave just the bottom half shin area or the lil bit that shows out of my pants. \n\nAlso like in another comment I carry my essence lip and cheek tint that stuff brings me to life. It is so amazing. ",

        "body": "I’ve had depression my whole life so I have loads of these: \n\n- Keep a physical face scrub in the shower. If I’ve been struggling doing my skincare and haven’t been exfoliating then the scrub helps me get an instant polish. I also used to keep a green clay mask stick in the shower too so I could quickly wipe it on and do a quick mask. \n\n- Washing my face using a muslin cloth. I swear by these things. Me and my mum used to use hot cloth cleansers so we ended up with loads of them and now I use them when I oil cleanse and to remove makeup. It’s not super rough but the fine texture also works great to gently physically exfoliate. If works wonders on lips! Better than any lip scrub I’ve ever used. Speaking of lip scrubs… \n\n- DIY lip scrub of honey, Vaseline and sugar. Can also use olive oil with it. Put it in a little pot and keep practically forever! \n\n- I buy cheap empty cuticle pens off Temu and fill them with Jojoba oil. I keep them at every sink in my house and in my bags. \n\n- I have a ‘mini’ makeup kit that just has mini products for when I need to rush off somewhere and need to do my makeup on public transport or in a car etc (I don’t drive). I have even got small pots on Temu and decanted products in there, but I also just collected samples or any small products specifically for that bag. It’s also great if you’re going somewhere for the night - I hate having to unpack when I’m back and this way I don’t have to get my makeup lost and confused. Some of the products are multi use (I keep a brown eyebrow pencil that can double up as an eyeliner and lip liner and lip products that can double as blush and eyeshadow) \n\n- I keep miscellar water and makeup wipes in my room if I don’t have the energy to clean my face \n\n- I haven’t done this in years cause it takes ages but I used to do lash lifts in the summer. With neat brows and the lashes done I almost never wore makeup\n\n- I always have a staple pair of hoop earrings I never take out which reduces the fatigue of choosing some everyday. You also look more put together even when you’re low energy\n\n- I keep a squeeze bottle of hand cream on my key ring. I’m germ vigilant so I sanitise a lot but it dries me out so this helps replace lost moisture and oils \n\n- I have a silicone face mask cover that I put over sheet masks to make them last longer because they don’t dry out, and it also keeps them in place so you can move around more comfortably \n\n- I don’t shave my legs in the winter. Almost never. I live in a cold country so the extra hair provides insulation and my bf quite likes it. \n\n- I apply a roll on and a spray deodorant. I use the roll on first then the spray to ‘set’ it. I apply them at night as it gives more time for the ingredients to work. I apply in the morning again but I find that it works much better throughout the day when applying at night\n\n- I do my nails myself. I’m still learning and experimenting but I bought a cheap polygel kit online with a load of polishes. I can do gel nails quite comfortably but extensions are a bit harder. It takes ages but with a show in the background the time flies\n\n- When I change my sheets I double up on pillowcases on each pillow so I can change them more regularly to maintain good skin and hair. My bedding is annoying to get to so rhis is easier. I use fake satin ones and if I use normal cotton ones I have a satin head wrap I’ll use then instead \n\n- I have this small rectangular water bottle shaped like a notebook that fits into any purse/ handbag so I can still be hydrated but look cute. I drink a lot of water and it always annoyed me that I could never wear handbags because there was no way to fit a water bottle\n\n- I buy tiny bottles to decent body spray and perfume and throw them in my bags \n\nThere are more but my brain has stopped working lol",

    "body": "In the doctor's office at the Taurian embassy in Chicago, a caramel brown minotaur with large polished white horns sits on an examination table while a fellow Taurian, white and black spotted with much shorter white and brown streaked horns, looks at an x-ray clipped onto an illumination board.\n\n\"Why did you go into the wilderness without shoes? We have boots and shoes for a reason!\" The doctor more asked himself as he shook his head, still looking at the x-ray.\n\n\"Yeah, that was stupid.\" the bull on the table sheepishly replied, rubbing his right horn slightly. \"I was going out with a heif who was a naturalist and, there she wanted to go on a weekend getaway to a nudist camp and well,\" the bull struggled for the right words. \"well, anyway, I found out I am not a naturalist.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ah, hormones. I don't miss those days.\" The doctor replied. \"Based on the x-ray, this was 3 months ago?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I noticed the rocks when we got back, I got out what I could but one was wedged in and she convinced me the others would work their way out and I didn't need a doctor, I just needed to soak my feet, use oils, which worked GREAT, because it completely solved my problem!\" the bull replied with only a slight amount of sarcasm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Absolutely. So it's obviously infected, given your pain, so I'll give you antibiotics for that, HOWEVER, that rock needs to come out. While I could do that, I am not a hoof expert by far and there are no Taurian hoof specialists on the planet. So here are your options. One,\" The doctor pointed out a finger and started counting with them for show. \"You go to the nearest Taurian station, which is a week out. Option 2, bring the doctor here, but that's very expensive and would still be a week or more. Option 3 I could of course do it, but given the depth you need an expert.\" The bull nodded, accepting when the doctor suggested than an expert would be much better. \"So option 4, the one I suggest and I have actually gone to for treatment. There is a human doctor up in Wisconsin that is really, really good at trimming hoofs AND\" The doctor would see the objection in his patients face but tried to answer his questions before they were asked, \"He has received additional training on our physiology, so he's actually the embassy's pick for treating our hoofs. Seriously, he's good, probably better than any other Taurian I've ever gone to.\"\n\nThe bull thought for a moment, but it really wasn't much of a decision. He didn't want to be on a ship for two weeks. \"OK, I'll go see this human.\"\n\n\"Great! I'll have the pilot spool up the VTOL and they can get you there in 2 hours. He usually only sees Taurian patients every other Wednesday and you're lucky that's today, so unless you want to wait two weeks, I suggest you hurry up.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the bull hobbled into the VTOL, the female Taurian pilot turned towards him. \"Gonna see the hoof guy? He's great! Took care of a split and lesion last year. I wonder if he could squeeze me into today too, I'm about due to for a trim.\"\n\nAngus wondered what he had gotten himself into as he closed the VTOL door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe flight passed by remarkably fast, thanks to the conversation with the pilot during the trip. Holly, the pilot, explained that the hoof guy wasn't exactly a doctor but earned his living trimming the hooves of livestock and posts videos of that on the internet. The Taurian embassy approached him a few years ago and they formed a partnership that has lasted ever since.\n\n\"Is he going to post a video of my trimming?\" He asked, not entirely sure he wanted to be on camera.\n\n\"Yeah, and it's really no big deal. It's kind of cool really. I watched the video him fixing my split and it was oddly mesmerizing and I see why the humans like watching it.\" She paused for a slight moment. \"If you want, I can send you the link later.\"\n\n\"Yeah, please, I think I would like that.\" Angus replied, realizing that it might be interesting to see the process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHolly made a wide circle of the town so Angus could see it. It really wasn't much of a town, a few small buildings, with the most noticeable feature being the giant landing pad behind the buildings. Holly touched the VTOL craft down with barely a bump and Angus opened the VTOL door to get out, with Holly right behind him. He looked at the buildings and noticed that the office was sandwiched between a hardware store and an ice cream shop, all three of which had large doors to accommodate the much larger Taurian frame, which was nice to see out this far from Chicago. He occasionally had to go to other cities for his job, and trying to find shops that could accommodate his 3 meter height was nearly impossible sometimes.\n\nAs they entered the office, Holly called out to the much smaller human wearing scrubs. \"Hey Doc, how you doing today?\"\n\n\"Ah, Holly, good to see you!\" He gave a slight wave as he was leading another Taurian into the lobby. \"Thanks for bringing my next patient, and let me guess, you'd like a trim too while you're here?\"\n\n\"You know it!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter signing his paperwork, along with a video release form, Angus sat on the much larger than he expected examination bench and started to unlace his boots. He looked over at the Doc as he was preparing his tools and noticed some things he was not expecting.\n\n\"Is that an angle grinder?\" Angus asked as he pointed at one of the tools before looking at what looked like powered restraints. \"And are those to hold me down?!?\"\n\n\"Yep. Your outer hoof is quite hard, it's much easier and safer for both of us if your legs are secured. I don't know if you're realized this, but you are much larger than I am and you, well, you kick like a bull.\"\n\nAngus wanted to argue, but it just made too much sense. He even has to use powered tools to trim his own hooves, but they didn't look anything like that.\n\nThe Doc walked over to in front of Angus.\n\n\"Did Doc Brown tell you what I'm going to have to do?\"\n\n\"Um, no. I mean, I have an idea, but no.\" The Doc chuckled a little.\"Yeah, I didn't think so. Well, you know your hooves are not living tissue, right? Well, I'm going to have to take about an inch off the bottom, which is only about three months of growth so you won't even notice. Then I'm going to take that last rock out, carve a little more horn out, treat the wound underneath and you'll be all set.\" He could see the concern in Angus's face. \"Don't worry, it won't hurt. You'll feel pressure, you'll feel my tools vibrating, but it's completely safe.\"\n\nStill unsure, but he trusted the professional's opinion, so he nodded.\n\n\"Great! Now lay down, face down on the table, with your feet near the restraints.\" He waited for Angus to lay down and walked towards his head, carrying a pair of earmuffs and safety goggles perfectly made for Taurian heads. \"Now you probably noticed the screen on the floor. We have a wide selection of movies and TV, or you can browse the internet. And before you even think of asking, my channel is blocked. That is not what you should be watching while I am working on your feet!\" Angus put on the protective gear. \"Now, any questions?\" Angus shook his head and the Doc went to work.\n\nIt felt a bit intimidating and odd to feel the restraints attaching to his lower leg, but he tried not to think about it. He put something on the screen, but to be honest it didn't even begin to catch his attention. All he could think of was the sensations on his feet as the Doc used the angle grinder on his feet (he quietly thanked the Doc for the ear protection. He knew he would have been even more scared with the loud noise.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter only a few minutes of grinding and pulling sensations, he felt release and relief as the rock was pulled from his foot, followed by a bit of tickling and cold as the wound was cleaned. Given how much his legs instinctively jerked, he was quiet glad he could not accidentally kick the Doc. Soon after, he felt something being pressed into the wound and is nearly instantly relieved the pain there. Not long after, the Doc tapped him on the earmuffs and asked him to sit up, which he did, along with removing the safety gear, and looked down at his hoofs. His right hoof had some green fabric wrapped around it and he could see an odd black piece on the opposite toe from the injury.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"That's a rubber block. The wound is open, so I put some salicylic acid on the lesion, wrapped it and put the block on the other toe so it won't put pressure on the injury. Leave the wrap on for a day, make sure you clean it daily after that, wear boots when you go out and I'll see you in two weeks.\"\n\nAngus put some weight on his injured hoof and while it initially felt weird with the rubber block, he quickly got used to it and realized it wasn't going to be an issue.\n\nAfter putting his boots on and walking into the lobby, the Doc said \"Why don't you go get a sherbet next door while I take care of Holly\" and then called Holly into the room. As she passed him, she asked him \"Can you get me one too? The blackberry is my favorite!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter getting two blackberry sherbets, he sat on the large bench outside and thought about his weird day.\n\nAnd the blackberry was quite good too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post brought to you by getting hooked after clicking on a random Nate the Hoof Guy video that appeared on my timeline.

    "body": "These are about 3 years apart. I took the auto smooth filter off and last pic is no makeup just after washing my face.\n\nMy melasma started suddenly in late 2019/early 2020 for no apparent reason. Started in between my eyebrows then migrated up my forehead until it hit a peak in 2021/2022 where my dad actually thought I had dirt on my face one time. \n\nThe only consistent thing I've done since 2021 was to add daily SPF. I use La Roche Posay cream and liquid (I use either one or the other depending on my mood) tinted SPF 50 and this has replaced my use of foundation. I keep it handy and reapply. I also try to use hats when I can. And I'm not perfect about it, I just am consisten mostof the time.\n\nI live in Canada, but sailed my boat down to Mexico last year, and lived on the boat in Mexico for half a year. So I was definitely outdoors in hot/sunny weather which I was super apprehensive about but I seem to have kept it under some kind of control. \n\nI have used a varying combination of the following, but I've been on and off off these over the time. I'm very un-perfect, but I do what I can when I can.\n\n- retinol 0.025% prescription. I use for a month-ish then a couple months off.\n- L. Ascorbic acid (the ordinary) powder mixed into a few drops of water and rubbed in in the morning. I love this.\n- hyaularonic acid (the ordinary) when I'm extra dry. I won't wear this in the morning if I'm going out in the sun. Not really sure why, I just  have a 'gut feeling' about this with nothing to back it up. But there you go. \n- alpha arbutin (the ordinary) I used for a while, not sure if it helped? \n- ZO skin hydroquinone 2%. I had 2 bottles: one I used in 2022 and then I was off of it for 2023 then 2024 I started again. I think this helped but man it's really hard to tell.\n- cleanser, I use whatever. Dove bar soap sometimes. I try to use pure witch hazel as a toner but havent always had it.\n- salicylic acid and lactic acid i like in the evenings once in a while\n- Skin ceuticals face scrub. I LOVE this and won't use it every day, but when I do it always just resets/refreshes like no other product I've found\n\nHonestly nothing sticks out as a holy grail except maybe the SPF. This is entirely anecdotal, but I think changing up my skincare and taking breaks from things has worked in a way because it prevents my skin from getting used to any one product. So being imperfect, but attentive, and following a gut feeling about products, maybe has helped. It's a lot of work, reading about everything, and finding a way to use them that feels right for my skin, but I'm SO happy that its paying off. I don't even see it much in the mirror anymore and I'm so happy.",

    "body": "***TL;DR: We’re going back to the basics with Acne 101. We’ll talk through the main types of acne, what causes it, the daily clarifying routine and acne-friendly makeup products to consider. Most importantly, we want to encourage you to see your skin’s potential—not just what it is today, but what it can become tomorrow.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6xisq0vf5e71.jpg?width=2119&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aec516da1b222dcf0cfd931190055876d5959507\n\n**What types of acne are there?**\n\nAccording to Dr. Howard Murad , dermatologist and creator of eponymous skincare line, there are four types of acne.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/249ayb6wf5e71.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dc906966d312c5babcb375985065839d1e3a35e\n\nThe first two fall under the **comedonal acne** category: whiteheads and blackheads. These two are non-inflammatory acne, or clogged pores that show up in the form of whiteheads and blackheads. According to dermatologist Dr. Rita Linkner, comedonal acne lives mostly in the t-zone, known as the forehead, nose and chin.\n\nThe third type is **traditional acne**, which comes to life in the form of inflamed, red bumps. Lastly, there is **cystic acne**, a more severe inflammatory acne characterized by very inflamed red bumps deep under the skin’s surface.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ooi29y4yf5e71.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e2f8f8c843872cd69310047fdd11843ab37b36d\n\n“Cystic acne \\[is typically found on the\\] lower third of the face or jaw line and is more notorious for feeling larger, tender to the touch and leave behind blemishing and/or scars,” says Dr. Linkner.\n\nOther conditions are commonly confused with acne. Dr. Murad warns that acne excoriée, or redness and bumps caused by a person continuously touching or picking at their skin, can often be mistaken for acne. Rosacea and eczema are also sometimes mistaken for acne, as is folliculitis, or inflammation around the hair follicles on the skin.\n\n**What causes acne in the first place?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1sb7vgzf5e71.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfd5b556f15be0edc408b8c1f02145acbab2e795\n\nAcne is complex. There are multiple players involved, all of which play a role. Understanding the underlying cause of your acne can inspire the start to your skincare journey.\n\nGenetics and hormonal conditions are major factors, but ultimately, Dr. Murad says what causes acne is a combination of excess oil and bacteria that clog the hair follicles on the skin and the subsequent inflammation that occurs. You only get acne in places where there are hair follicles, which is why you can get it on areas like the face, chest and back, but not on your hands. See what helps clarify oil and bacteria [here](https://www.ulta.com/beauty-reads/skin/acne-questions/).\n\nDiet effects acne as well, as the health of your skin is dependent on the health of your body overall.  Exercising can also bring out the oil in your face. Dr. Linkner recommends, “Mak\\[ing\\] sure you’re not sitting in your sweaty clothes for too long…Trying to shower really soon after you exercise will prevent you from building body acne by just taking all those oils off you.”\n\nMany have suffered from “maskne” since the onset of the pandemic. “Make sure you’re using an active wash, with alpha and beta hydroxy acids,” says Dr. Linkner. “Often that just keeps your oil production under your mask under control so that you’re not breaking out as much.”\n\n**Acne scarring**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r34p4dt0g5e71.jpg?width=2152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ea1fe2769efa9cd026abbbc21982e6f3c6fea9d\n\nAccording to Dr. Linkner, acne scarring and scarring in general is genetic. “We’re all kind of predestined to be people who scar or people who don’t. And you don’t really recognize what cohort you’re in until you grow up a little bit. So, your best bet is to keep your hands \\[and\\] tools off of your skin.”\n\nIf you have scars, you can take steps to heal them.

Here is a step-by-step guide on what type of products to use and in what order :\n\n**1. Cleanser**: You can skip this step in the morning if your skin type is dry (or wash with water only), but it’s a non-negotiable in the evening when you need to remove dirt, oil and makeup.\n\n* ***Product recommendations:*** [Murad Acne Control Clarifying Cleanser](https://www.ulta.com/p/acne-control-clarifying-cleanser-prod2082345?sku=2082345&cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1208065574605&CAAGID=123579250532&CAWELAID=202393575&CATARGETID=330000200002744198&CADevice=c&gclid=CjwKCAjwrPCGBhALEiwAUl9X06HkVrENtEG9_uOoTtgp19mO_PEi5cYO9kBn4SZm53VcIv-tYEPXthoCo8oQAvD_BwE), [Derma E Acne Deep Pore Cleansing Wash](https://www.ulta.com/p/acne-deep-pore-cleansing-wash-pimprod2003750), [Ulta Beauty Collection Super Soothe Gentle Daily Cleanser](https://www.ulta.com/p/super-soothe-gentle-daily-cleanser-pimprod2012335), [Fresh Soy Face Cleanser](https://www.ulta.com/p/soy-face-cleanser-pimprod2025100)\n\n**2. Toner:** Next comes toner, if you’re using it. While many toners act like a secondary cleanser, some are designed to exfoliate with acids, while others leave behind a layer of moisture.\n\n* ***Product recommendations:*** [Murad Clarifying Toner](https://www.ulta.com/p/clarifying-toner-prod2082347?sku=2082347&_requestid=2683239), [Good Molecules Niacinamide Brightening Toner](https://www.ulta.com/p/niacinamide-brightening-toner-pimprod2023929?sku=2582308&_requestid=2684055), [The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution](https://www.ulta.com/p/glycolic-acid-7-toning-solution-pimprod2007097?sku=2551155&cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1290694115924&CAAGID=122272354242&CAWELAID=330000200001794772&CATARGETID=330000200002762493&CADevice=c&gclid=CjwKCAjwrPCGBhALEiwAUl9X0_BV8vXNTsp8AqHYtHfz7fGk7mQdIQRe670hZg9-SMYjh8URrw-0dhoCfqIQAvD_BwE), [Kylie Skin Vanilla Milk Toner](https://www.ulta.com/p/vanilla-milk-toner-pimprod2009645)\n\n**3. Treatments:** Apply any targeted, medicated or prescription products, which should always go directly onto clean skin. Make sure they fully dry before moving on.\n\n* **Salicylic acid**\\*\\*:\\*\\* The key ingredient to look out for is salicylic acid, according to Dr. Murad. “It sloughs away dead skin cells to keep the pore clear and unblocked. This helps prevent acne from forming and helps ingredients that fight acne causing bacteria to be delivered more effectively and efficiently.”\n   * ***Product recommendations:*** [Mario Badescu Glass Bottle Drying Lotion](https://www.ulta.com/p/glass-bottle-drying-lotion-xlsImpprod6500224?sku=2209808&_requestid=2690644), [Clinique Acne Solutions Clinical Clearing Gel](https://www.ulta.com/p/acne-solutions-clinical-clearing-gel-xlsImpprod10791825), [Tula Clear It Up Acne Clearing & Tone Correcting Gel](https://www.ulta.com/p/clear-it-up-acne-clearing-tone-correcting-gel-pimprod2004442), [Kinship Pimple Potion Retinal + Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment](https://www.ulta.com/p/pimple-potion-retinal-salicylic-acid-acne-treatment-pimprod2017788)\n* **Benzoyl peroxide**: Another popular ingredient is benzoyl peroxide, which targets that acne-causing bacteria and is anti-inflammatory, but it can be potentially drying and irritating, Dr. Murad says.\n   * ***Product recommendations***: [La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Dual Acne Treatment](https://www.ulta.com/p/effaclar-duo-dual-acne-treatment-xlsImpprod3840059?_requestid=2693977), T[ula Go Away Acne Spot Treatment](https://www.ulta.com/p/go-away-acne-spot-treatment-pimprod2009738?sku=2549743&_requestid=2697462), [Truly Super Heart Acne Patches](https://www.ulta.com/p/super-heart-acne-patches-pimprod2019278?catargetid=330000200002232593&CAPCID=438981188552&CATCI=aud-842617173106:dsa-961016932237&CAAGID=91268164291&CADevice=c&gclid=CjwKCAjwrPCGBhALEiwAUl9X0xSxwzK20y9t-X4NnltpodQbYPvEXDsQlFL1KzJYrv8xXGSIrETRiBoCU6IQAvD_BwE), [Urban Skin Rx Clear Complexion Acne Serum + Spot Treatment](https://www.ulta.com/p/clear-complexion-acne-serum-spot-treatment-pimprod2004078?sku=2542186&_requestid=2697967)\n\n**4. Essence:** The lightest product you’re using comes next.

Serums:** These tend to be a little thicker or gel like, but not as heavy as moisturizer. Serums also have high levels of active ingredients.\n\n* ***Product recommendations***: [Murad InvisiScar Resurfacing Treatment](https://www.ulta.com/p/invisiscar-resurfacing-treatment-pimprod2007161), [Mario Badescu Anti Acne Serum](https://www.ulta.com/p/anti-acne-serum-xlsImpprod6200675?sku=2209804&_requestid=2702650), [PEACH & LILY Glass Skin Refining Serum](https://www.ulta.com/p/glass-skin-refining-serum-xlsImpprod18971035), [Beekman 1802 Milk Drops Probiotic Ceramide Serum](https://www.ulta.com/p/milk-drops-probiotic-ceramide-serum-pimprod2017547)\n\n**6.

Think about it in terms of how you’d layer clothing. A thick sweater goes on last, after a thin T-shirt. Similarly, a thick moisturizer goes on last, after a lightweight serum. Starting with your lightest products ensures they can actually penetrate into the skin and do their intended duties.\n\nLooking for more personalized product recommendations for your skin? Try Ulta Beauty’s Skin Analysis tool in the [Ulta Beauty app](https://www.ulta.com/company/app). Answer a few quick questions, take a scan of your face for an in-depth analysis and you’ll get a personalized report with routines and products for your skin goals.\n\n**When to see a dermatologist**\n\nIt’s important to give skincare products at least 21 days to see results. Remember that all products are different and it’s best to follow the individual product directions.\n\n“If you’re using really good active ingredients that you’re finding over the counter and you’re still struggling with acne, then your next call should be to your board-certified dermatologist,” says Dr. Linkner.",

[I guess Lab Muffin didn't either and said other Niacinamides worked better so maybe I'll try another brand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zWB5jy8h0c)\n* A lot of the peptides I looked up seemed to have the same benefits as retinoids but with fewer side effects, BUT they are less well studied\n* [Salicylic Acid should ideally be combined with anti-bacterials like benzyl peroxide or azalaic acid to be most effective against regular acne](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid)\n* [Linoleic acid ](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/linoleic-acid)seems pretty awesome, but [Oleic acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/oleic-acid) might be bad for acne, so if you have it you might want to skip [The Ordinary products that contain it](https://www.myroutinebuilder.com/ingredients/oleic-acid). This just adds to my hate of NMF + HA (I hated the texture) since it has Oleic Acid.\n\nAnyway, hope this list was interesting and you find the new [Ordinary Ingredients Dictionary ](https://www.myroutinebuilder.com/ingredients)useful. LMK if you have any features you'd like to see! I know there are already a lot of ingredients sites out there but it's not always easy to see one brand's ingredients at a glance.",

I also I haven’t had any breakouts and previous ones are clearing up and pigmentation has improved too!

Been following this religiously for a few weeks and it really has made a world of difference to my skin, I haven't seen a huge red inflamed pimple (still got a couple small ones but they went away in a day), and my skin feels softer & healthier. I also slowly incorporated a BP 4% wash once every 2-3 days (any more dries me out & is counterproductive).\n\nSo all you dry skin folks with acne - try to focus on healing your moisture barrier for a couple months before moving on to actives. If nothing else, at least you will have a soothing routine in place & be prepared for the actives.",

    "body": "I cleanse, moisturize, and use spf every day. I change my pillowcase every 3 days. I pretty much only drink water. I get at least 7 hours of sleep every night. I am eating basically vegan, I'm avoiding dairy and meat as much as I can. I don't drink alcohol or caffeine. I don't use any drugs. I've tried a multitude of different topicals/ingredients/treatments. \n\n\nAnd yet, I am still stuck with consistent breakouts both on my face and body. I know it's genetic/hormonal. I know my only answer is pretty much just isotretinoin at this point. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot go on it at the moment due to moving around too much and dealing with other health issues that need prioritized treatment. \n\nI feel my acne has taken so much of my confidence and security in my looks. I know it's not even very severe acne but since I don't wear makeup due to it breaking me out even more, I know it stands out. I hate looking in the mirror and seeing the red pop out at me. I know that it is preventing me from being seen as truly attractive. \n\nI hate that I was born with these horrible genetics that have given me such shitty skin. I hate feeling unattractive and like I'm just not meant to be beautiful.\n\nUPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Addiction/comments/15899f9/update_i_am_proof_you_can_do_everything_right_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nUpdate on update post lol: Mods locked the update post for....some reason so ig I'll just post what I said here:\n\nHey everyone,\n\nSo my post got a lot more attention than I expected lol\n\nI'm very thankful for the all the responses but, If I'm completely honest, I'm quite a bit overwhelmed with all the suggestions. There's a lot of people asking me to try a lot of different things and I simply do not have the time or money to try everything :(\n\nTo answer a few of the common suggestions:\n\n1.Isotretinoin/spironolactone:  Unfortunately, I am not able to go on isotretinoin/accutane at the present time. I am moving around too much to get the required monthly testing done. I also am currently dealing with more prioritized health issues (both mental and physical) and I believe that the effects of isotretinoin would exacerbate the negative effects of these issues and interrupt their treatment.\n\nI actually had a previous derm recommend spiro but he told me that I would need to be constantly monitored for low blood pressure and 1. that is very scary and 2. it goes back to my first point.\n\n(I'm ngl the people talking about possible nerve damage + heart palpitations from spiro also scares me, the known side effects of isotret also really scare me, hence me not doing either to this day)\n\n2.Spearmint/Mint/Green tea: I actually haven't had spearmint tea before. It sounds like a great option but, unfortunately, it has tannins which would limit the absorption of my current required supplements. \n\nI have regularly drank matcha in the past, I don't think it really had an impact on my acne, though.\n\n3.Seeking medical help/dermatologist: I have seen 4 dermatologists in the past. One gave me a bunch of topicals and niacin, no big changes. Another put me on Epiduo, no big changes. The last put me on an antibiotic I no longer remember and that was probably the clearest skin I've ever had. Unfortunately, I couldn't be on it long term and it all came back as soon as I went off it :')\n\nThat last one was the one who recommended spiro. \n\nI haven't gone back to a dermatologist cause I can't really afford it anymore and I just got tired of not getting results. I wasn't ready for spiro or isotret so I just stopped.\n\n4.Blood work for hormone checking/allergies: I have never had blood work done for hormones, I'm not really sure what that means. I'm not really sure how I would go about that and what that'd mean for my skin.\n\nI have had blood work done for allergens, no identified major allergies except moderate dust allergy. \n\n5.Stress: Unfortunately, I think my life is just gonna be pretty stressful for a while lol. I don't come from a wealthy family and I have a pretty useless degree (+ a plethora of other problems) so my life is just kinda composed of stress atm. \n\n6.Diet: Oh boy. So, I feel I do my best to eat as healthy as I can. I make an effort to eat vegetables every day and fruit when I can. I drink pretty much only water. I make sure I stay at or under the recommended daily values for sodium and added sugar. I avoid dairy and meat as much as I can. I've made an effort to increase my olive oil/avocado intake. \n\nA lot of people are saying to cut sugar entirely. I'm sorry but I simply can't do that. Idk if you saw it in my post but I avoid A LOT of things: alcohol, drugs, meat, dairy. Sugar is the one thing I have left that makes eating enjoyable. I do make an effort to not go above 25 mg of added sugar a day. I just can't give it up entirely, I really don't have much to look forward to each day with how my life is going rn and it's my one little guilty pleasure I can have to brighten the day up a bit.\n\n7.Zinc: I HAVE done a zinc soap before, I don't think it really made much of a difference. Maybe I should look into a zinc supplement, I would need to check interactions with my current supplements, though. \n\n8.Fibroids: I've had x-rays done in my pelvic area and have never heard anything about these. Maybe they're only detectable w other imaging? I don't think I could afford a CAT or MRI scan rn :(\n\n9.Birth Control: I have thought many, MANY times about going on birth control. My family has a really bad history with birth control, specifically the pill. I've thought about an IUD but haven't heard anything about it clearing acne. Idk I've just heard so many traumatic things about birth control from the people around me and I've just been really hesitant to get on it (don't worry, I've never been sexually active). I also heard your acne just comes back  x10 once you get off.\n\n10.Hair products: I literally don't use anything in my hair lmao, I use hairspray VERY rarely. I do have oily ass hair that may cause some of my forehead acne but I cannot control that unless I just go bald.\n\n11.Pregnancy: I know this isn't really a suggestion but I also don't really plan on having kids for a multitude of reasons soooo I don't even have that to look forward to 😭\n\n12.Fungal: I'm pretty sure I was told my acne was not fungal at some point by a derm. I def believe it is hormonal, idk I could be wrong, maybe fungal acne can be hormonal?\n\n\nThere's quite a few people who asked for my skin type/products so here ya go:\n\nMy skin type: OILYYY and SENSITIVEEEE holy shit I don't know anyone with more sensitive skin than me \n\nMy products:\nI only rinse with water and then moisturize  (Cerave Moisturizing Cream (yes, I know this is a controversial one!! unfortunately, I HAVE to buy it anyways for my eczema (nothing else works) and I don't really have the budget to be buying two moisturizers rn) + spf (physical zinc sunscreen) in the morning. \n\nEvening:\nSalicylic Acid Cleanser (I leave it on for like 5 min before rinsing)\nCerave Moisturizing Cream",

Basically just meat and organs, eggs, raw dairy, honey and fruit, bone marrow etc. Everbody is different, but for some people vegetables can trigger skin conditions such as eczema or acne. One cause of acne is possibly unbound iron (phytic acid in plants prevents absorption of some iron). Pasteurized milk would cause breakouts for me, but I don't get any problems with raw dairy. Its a whole rabbit hole to go down, but vegetables naturally contain defense chemicals and phytoalexins. Some people tolerate these fine, other people break out in autoimmune diseases.\n\nJust saying that an animal based diet might be your solution. Antibiotics and drugs are only bandaid solutions, once you come off the acne will come back worse because now your gut and skin flora are damaged.\n\nAlso using beef tallow on my acne and aztec clay as a cleanser worked very well.",

        "body": "I’m not a doctor, so I would advise doing your own research on this, but based on my own personal experiences my hormonal acne has been the result of a combination of stress, the food I eat, having high androgen levels, and insulin resistance. In women, having high androgen levels can cause an increase in production of sebum, which increases chances of clogged pores and getting acne.\n\nSince you mentioned your diet is mostly vegan, I assume that a high portion of your macros likely come from carbs. Carbs aren’t inherently bad, but it is well known that eating high carb meals especially as your first meal of the day spike blood sugar levels which can over time lead to insulin resistance. In women, insulin resistance can lead to high androgen levels which leads to increase production of sebum, and so forth. \n\nWhen I have focused on reducing my insulin resistance by limiting sugars and eating balanced meals, I’ve noticed significant progress in reduction of my hormonal acne. However, whenever I get very stressed and I deviate from eating well my acne flares up around my jawline and other parts of my body.\n\nTopical products do help with acne to some degree, but in reality the best way to combat hormonal acne comes down to what we eat and how we manage stress. Unless you have certain food allergies, I wouldn’t cut out meat from your diet or any foods in particular. Dairy and gluten are more likely to cause inflammation in people, but unless you’re allergic or sensitive to them, there is no real reason to cut them off completely. Sugar on the other hand, cutting off processed sugars and other sweeten beverages will be so beneficial in the long run. For any sweet cravings, eating whole fruit is a great alternative because of the fiber, but fruit juices should be limited or avoided if possible as they spike blood sugar levels.\n\nIt is definitely worth getting some blood tests done if you can to see if you may have high androgen levels or underlying insulin resistance. A lot of people think that A1c blood test is an indicator for insulin resistance, but it is actually not, so you may have normal blood sugar levels and not be pre-diabetic, but still be insulin resistant. If you want to check for it, be sure to ask your doctor that you want an insulin fasting blood test and not A1c. \n\nBest of luck! You’ll get through this :)",

Wash my face, use the rice water as a face mist for the whole day (i don't go out much and if i did i switched it to a sunscreen) at night i use the same cleanser and spray a generous amount of roce water on my face and neck (like dripping wet).

Doctors just kept pushing birth control birth control birth control and it DOESNT WORK FOR MY ACNE! I’m on the pill right now and it hasn’t helped any more than it did when I was 16.\n\nHere I am almost 34 with a jawline full of cystic breakouts, nose full of sebaceous filaments, and forehead covered in tiny bumps. I wash my face twice a day and still break out. Oh and I can lightly drag my pimple popper against my skin and get pus squeezing out of every pore AFTER washing my face. My face is a grease slick an hour after washing my face- and yes I do use oil free moisturizer because I was told if your face gets dry your skin overproduces oil but my skin is NOT dry and still produces sooo much oil! \nAnd it’s not just my face- my chest and shoulders and upper arms all get breakouts too! \n\nAnd folks, let me tell you I have tried EVERY. THING. To get it under control. If you can think of “oh have you tried….?” YES I HAVE! \n\nCleansers of all types- oil, foaming, scrubs. Masks and creams and acne treatments like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, azelic acid, BHAs, AHAs, retinols, and every serum under the sun. \n\nI’ve tried diet changes- I’m already lactose intolerant so it’s NOT DAIRY!! I do not have celiac or gluten intolerance. \n\nI’ve tried supplements- zinc and herbs of all sorts. \n\nI wash my pillow TWICE weekly (sheets once weekly) with gentle unscented detergent and no fabric softener and shower every other day. \n\nNow, for the prescription stuff-\n\nI did ONE month of Accutane and it actually started working. However, anyone who’s been on Accutane knows how goddamn restricted and regulated it is and my dermatologists office kept dropping the ball on approving it within 7 days after answering the questions on iPledge and I never was able to get my prescription filled beyond that one month. My insurance now is absolute garbage so that is NOT an option. \n\nThe ONLY other prescription that got rid of my acne was daily minocycline- an antibiotic. \n\nThis tells me my acne MUST be bacterial but even using anti bacterial acne treatments topically aren’t working! \n\nUgh I feel like I’m gunna be 80 years old and still have pimples!!

Applause for your effort and perseverance!\n\nWhile many doctors prescribe birth control blindly, they usually fail to mention the underlying cause.\n\nBased on the placement and severity of your acne, it sounds like you may have Poly-Cystic Ovarian Syndrome, which is a cluster diagnosis that includes the body producing excess androgens (male hormones)\n\nLots of birth control formulas don't affect these, only some do.\n\nTry to talk to your fictional about spironolactone. It's a targeted medication that suppresses androgens, and helps cis women dealing with stubborn acne. It also doesn't have nearly the side effects of Accutane, like suicidal thoughts.\n\nI say cis because it is taken by trans women to help transition, and you can find lots of helpful info on Trans subs about it.\n\nI really think this is an androgen issue, but the other avenue to follow for stubborn acne is fungal treatments, but I would try specifically androgen-suppressing birth control or Spiro first.\n\nThat said, the emotions are tough. We tell ourselves that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, beautiful on the inside, etc etc but as a society we know these are shallow platitudes. It's so hard and embarrassing to have to face the world when you feel so hurt and gross.\n\nI hope you are at least able to recognise your own strength and how far you have already come.\n\nEdit: including some info links\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/pcos-acne#hormones\n\nhttps://www.midlandskin.co.uk/treatments/spironolactone-acne/\n\n\nRetin-A is a prescription-strength retinoid, much stronger than any beauty counter retinol.

To combat obesity, I went on a strict diet of whole foods (cooked or raw) and portion controlled and the weight plummeted. In the process, my acne completely disappeared!

I've been tested for food allergies and have a huge list now but milk is NOT one of the problems.

Tried a benzoyl peroxide treatment which was far too strong and dried out the area I treated, leaving it wrinkly and leathery for a week or two (actually worse than the acne).\n\nRoaccutane eventually did the trick and got it under control for a while after I finished taking it, but you've already said you are finding Accutane difficult to get - and it's honestly not that fun to be on, makes you super thirsty all the damn time. And it wasn't a permanent fix.\n\nIn my early 20s I tried out some toners (both liquid and soaked pads) which started to have an effect with daily use - didn't solve the problem, but made it much less prominent.\n\nIn my mid 20s I eventually got onto 'proactiv solution' due to a heavy advertising campaign they had at the time. It's a cleanser + toner + benzoyl peroxide combo system, and that ended up working pretty much perfectly. By the time I hit 30, I no longer had to treat it and was mostly acne free, though even having hit 40 now, I still break out a little bit now and then, but it's just isolated pimples.\n\nSo while you've already said you've tried benzoyl peroxide, I didn't have success with it either, until I tried it in combination with the other stuff, as a package. You can buy a pack of the 3 things together in chemists, or order it online. I ended up paying for a subscription for a while, as I was using it on multiple areas.\n\nBasically, you wash with the cleanser, dry off, apply the toner and let it dry for a few minutes, then apply the benzoyl peroxide cream lightly. It's not too uncomfortable even under clothes, and the toner actually feels pretty nice/cooling, if anything. The only annoyance is that you're meant to avoid too much sunlight (which is pretty common with a lot of the treatments I've seen) and it can bleach your clothes a bit over time.\n\nTook about 10 days to see it obviously working, for me. To be clear, I don't view proactiv as a *cure*, I view it as a treatment to keep it under control - I suspect that hitting 30 was just the personal milestone for it to stop being much of an issue for me.\n\nJust thought I'd share, as it helped me out when I found it - and I'd been long frustrated by most over the counter stuff not being much help.\n\nOh, and I can echo the other people who are mentioning that once my skin calmed down and stopped misbehaving, people ended up commenting on how youthful etc I looked as I went past 30 :P so hopefully you've got a similar perk waiting in the wings as you age :D",

        "body": "You’re experiencing a second puberty on T, and androgens do cause more oil production which can lead to more breakouts. My bf is about to start on T, and he’s worried about the skin side effects, so we’ve been doing some research on good skincare regiments! I also had really bad acne growing up, and what really fixed it for me was accutane and a very simple skincare routine.\n\nI have a couple of questions and a couple of suggestions… before starting on T, were you prone to breakouts? What kinds of products did you use for your skin before starting T?\n\nA really good, simple skincare routine that will help your skin barrier recover (recommended by my derm!) is:\n- vanicream facial wash (once in the morning, once in the evening)\n- vanicream facial moisturizer (spf one in the morning, non-spf at night)\n- try using ONE active in the EVENING, apply before your moisturizer and let it sink in all the way before putting the moisturizer on top. You generally don’t want to use actives during the day, since they make your skin a lot more sensitive to sun exposure. \n\nDifferin worked just okay for me; what really really worked was tretinoin 0.1% (although this medication will require a good period of adjustment).\n\nGive your skin a break from actives once or twice a week, and instead apply La Roche Posay cicaplast 5+ baume on top of your moisturizer. It feels thick, but it works absolute wonders for barrier repair and always leaves my skin glowing in the morning.\n\nIf you can get access to accutane, that was really the miracle worker for me. If you choose to go that route, don’t use any other actives (acids, etc) alongside it, and use an spf 50+ sunscreen daily. Also, the cicaplast baume will help a lot with keeping your skin barrier healthy, since accutane can be really hard on that at first. Best of luck!!!",

    "body": "So, over the course of several months that I have been a part of this community, I have seen many posts about someone's skin worsening on the beginner's routine. Many times this is due to an over-zealousness to dive into skincare head-first, but is also due to a general lack of knowledge about the parts of your routine that may be problematic to begin with. *Because of that, the focus of this post is to help you evaluate your current routine and make changes where it may be best rather than scrapping everything in your routine at once.*\n\n**REMEMBER TO SPOT TEST NEW PRODUCTS WHEN POSSIBLE BEFORE ADDING THEM TO YOUR ROUTINE. ALSO PLEASE NOTE THAT SKIN MAY TAKE UP TO 28 DAYS TO PRESENT A REACTION TO A PRODUCT.** \n\n---\n\n**1. EVALUATING YOUR ROUTINE -- A GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**\n\nA majority of people have a small routine already. Some of you have come to us simply using a cleanser, while others already have a routine of a couple drugstore products. *Just because it is not CeraVe or Beginner Routine approved does not mean that your routine is necessarily bad*. This subreddit, first and foremost, is about educating people about their skin and sharing that knowledge with others so they can make better choices for their skin, which is entirely unique to them. To do this, you need to first be able to evaluate your current routine, whatever it may be, and improve upon it. Much of this will come with time, experimentation, and knowledge that you build upon here, but here are a couple good starting points:\n\n* **What does your skin feel like after you cleanse?** Is it dry? Sensitive? Oily? Tons of blackheads on your cheeks or forehead? In my experience, this is usually a cleanser issue. Is your cleanser very sudsy (creates lots of bubbles when mixed with water)? Does your skin feel dry, tight, or \"sqeaky\" after you cleanse? Are you cleansing more than twice a day? If yes to any of these questions, try swapping out your cleanser only for one of the Beginner Routine cleansers and if you're prone to dry skin, try cleansing PM only. \n\n* **What does your skin feel like after you moisturize?** Does it still feel parched? Does it burn? Does it feel tingly? Does it get very red and not return to a more normalized flush after a few minutes? This is usually due to an incorrect moisturizer. Check the ingredients on the back for [common irritants](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/skin-irritation-your-worst-enemy#avoid). If you aren't seeing anything on this list, try swapping out your moisturizer only for one of the Beginner Routine friendly options. If you've already done this but your skin is still thirsting for moisture, try sleeping with a humidifier near your bed and using an occlusive (water-trapping ingredient), such as Vaseline, on your driest spots at night.\n\n* **What does your skin look like?** Is it rough? Do you get acne or small red bumps or patches on places like your cheekbones, beneath the eyes, or beside your nose? This is generally a cleansing issue. Are you scrubbing your face (when you cleanse) with a washcloth, facial scrub brush, sponge, scrub, or Clarisonic? Are you using a peel or an AHA frequently? Scrubbing and rubbing can be very irritating to some skin types, as can frequent chemical exfoliation. Try dropping these cleansing tools and/or products for a couple weeks, using only your hands to cleanse. Watch how your skin reacts. If it begins to improve, you can try re-introducing these cleansing and exfoliating tools again slowly, *or* you can drop them all-together and try alternatives (such as chemical exfoliation in place of physical scrubbing).\n\n* **Do you have small bumps on your forehead or jaw line?** These are usually [closed comedones](http://www.dermnet.com/images/Acne-Closed-Comedo), which is essentially \"acne that has already boarded the train.\" To combat this issue, try adding a BHA. [There's a great thread full of recommendations here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1cv60y/the_great_ahabha_product_thread/). However, if this is a recent development that only cropped up after adding a new product, [read this thread regarding purging v. breaking out](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1w179w/guide_am_i_purging/). Remember that BHAs dry out the skin and will require you to use a moisturizer to combat this issue. \n\n* **Does your skin look dull?** If you have skin that is dull in appearance, it is usually due to not enough exfoliation or lack of antioxidants. You can improve this by adding a good chemical exfoliator or antioxidant serum, or both. Remember to add products one at a time! Not sure which chemical exfoliator is good for your skin? [Here's a write-up I did about chemical exfoliation that may help](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fx45x/ahas_and_bhas_whats_the_difference_and_how_to/). Additionally, [here is a great list of recommended vitamin C serums](http://www.skinacea.com/products/vitamin-c.html#.UvG0kfldXxU).\n\n* **Are you using a sunscreen during the day?** Sunscreens are your best tool to prevent premature aging as well as worsening [melasma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melasma) or [post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1bjjwc/teach_it_tuesday_post_inflammatory/) (brown marks left over by acne). Before you buy a sunscreen, I highly recommend you read through [this list](http://www.skinacea.com/sunscreen/choose-right-sunscreen.html#.UvGqQPldXxU), which will educate you about choosing a sunscreen *before* you drop your hard-earned cash on one. Once you've read through that, [here's a great list of recommended sunscreens for you to check out](http://www.skinacea.com/products/sunscreens.html#.UvGqsPldXxU).\n\nOnce you have a routine that feels like it is working for you -- a process that may take several months of trial and error -- you can experiment with it and build upon it.\n\n---\n\n**2. IMPROVING UPON YOUR ROUTINE**\n\nMuch like building a routine, you need to examine what you're doing and what you feel could be better. Do you want to add in a serum? Are you looking to splurge on a more expensive sunscreen? Are you weeding out ingredients? Many of these issues are finer troubleshooting problems that make for a good thread of their own, but here are some general ideas.\n\n* **Are you looking to age-proof your routine?** Make sure you're using a good sunscreen. Evaluate [PPD value](http://www.skinacea.com/faq/sunscreen/s05-spf-vs-ppd.html#.UvGsGPldXxU), and be sure you're using a sunscreen with the highest PPD value your skin can tolerate. Remember that UVB is BURNING, while UVA is AGING. \n\n    Once you have determined that you are using the best sunscreen you can for your skin type, consider adding an antioxidant serum, which will improve your photoprotection and boost your skin's ability to heal and repair itself. [There's an expansive thread about antioxidant topicals here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1wyf27/psa_remember_to_use_your_vitamin_cantioxidant/) and [more recommendations here](http://www.skinacea.com/products/vitamin-c.html#.UvGtvPldXxU). \n\n    If you're already doing all of the above, make sure you're using an AHA or a retinol product, if you can tolerate either. Remember to start with the lowest percentages and move upwards as needed. AHAs and especially retinol products can be very irritating to some skin types. However, if you're ready to take the plunge with retinols, [there is a good list of retinols here](http://www.skinacea.com/products/retinoids.html#.UvGtwfldXxU), organized from weakest to strongest. I also really like [this article](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/anti-aging/_/anti-aging-superstars) about anti-aging ingredients over at Paula's Choice.\n\n    For a fairly complete post on this subject, [look at my answer to another Redditor here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1x4b2c/what_are_the_best_things_i_can_do_in_my_twenties/cf85ymq).\n\n* **Do you feel there is an ingredient that does not play well with your skin type?** Begin keeping a list of the products that irritated you as well as their ingredient lists (I like Google Docs for this). Once you have a sample pool, I highly recommend [cosDNA.com](http://cosdna.com/) as well as [Paula's Choice's Ingredient Dictionary](http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/) for evaluating individual ingredients and weeding out irritants. This will help you to make choices that are best for your skin type.\n\n* **Are you looking to add a more expensive product to your routine?** I highly recommend doing research about pricey products to be sure they are worth your cash. [MakeupAlley reviews](http://www.makeupalley.com/product/) is a good place to start, but don't forget to check this subreddit for opinions, as well as Google for blogger reviews. Be cautious of paid and filtered reviews. Some bloggers and websites are notorious for padding their reviews (Sephora), so use your best judgment.\n\n* **Are you looking to improve acne scars?** Once acne is gone, it usually leaves behind pink, red, brown, white, or indented marks. Each of these needs different treatment plans. [There's a helpful list here of the types of acne scarring as well as images of each](http://www.dermnetnz.org/acne/acne-scarring.html). \n\n    In short, PIE (post-inflammatory erythema) requires time, but can be treated with silicone sheets and laser treatments. [Read more about PIE here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1tk78i/post_inflammatory_erythema_pie/). PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) has many possible treatments, such as antioxidant topicals, azelaic acid, AHAs, peels, or laser treatments. [Read more about PIH here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1bjjwc/teach_it_tuesday_post_inflammatory/).  Indented scars generally are much tougher issues to fix and require a dermatologist's care. \n\n* **Are you worried about large pores or [sebaceous filaments](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/) (nose and chin \"blackheads\")?** Try adding in a [BHA](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1cv60y/the_great_ahabha_product_thread/) or using [mineral oil pre-cleanses](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/). To do a mineral oil pre-cleanse, just gently massage mineral oil (or another oil of your choice that you know works well for your skin already) into your skin for a minute or two, using your fingertips to focus on the areas of concern. You may gently wipe away excess with a lukewarm washcloth or dampened cotton square and follow it with your usual cleanser.\n\n---\n\n**3. COMMON BEGINNER QUESTIONS**\n\n* **Do I need an eye cream?** The general consensus of skincare addicts is no -- eye creams are a luxury item that are not necessary. They don't contain any additional benefits that your regular antioxidant serum would not provide. As such, just carry your regular moisturizer and serum beneath your eye area at night. \n\n* **Do I need a toner?** Nope. Toners were used when cleansers were not a proper pH value. However, most cleansers for facial skin are formulated with a proper pH now, and do not require a toner. \n\n   If you find that your water is very hard or your skin is dry, you may benefit from a moisturizing toner. Look for a toner without alcohol and steer clear of any astringents. \n\n* **What order do I apply products?** You generally will want to apply products in the following order: CLEANSER -> TONERS -> PRESCRIPTION TOPICALS -> TREATMENTS (BHA/AHA) -> SERUMS -> MOISTURIZER -> ANY OCCLUSIVES -> SUNSCREEN -> PRIMERS FOR MAKEUP -> MAKEUP\n\n* **How do I remove my makeup/waterproof sunscreen at night?** When using a more gentle cleanser, it is important that you use an oil-based cleanser first to loosen up and remove the product prior to cleansing with your regular cleanser. Many people like the [oil-cleansing method](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/), but I generally prefer to recommend cleansing oils for acne prones, which differs from oil-cleansing due to the emulsifiers in the cleansing oils that allow water to bond with the product and rinse away cleanly. Many companies make cleansing oils now, but I prefer ones without too many ingredients or frills, such as [Clinique's Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm](http://www.sephora.com/take-the-day-off-cleansing-balm-P126301) or [a homemade blend](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1tx7ia/so_i_made_my_own_cleansing_oil_spoiler_alert_im/).\n\n* **Is it possible to over-exfoliate skin?** Absolutely. If your skin is looking abnormally shiny, red, irritated, rough, or is unusually, painfully broken out (usually deep, painful, red \"cysts\") despite using your AHA, BHA, retinoid, or physical exfoliant (incl. Clarisonic), you are probably over-doing it. Both AHAs and BHAs can be used twice a day, but since AHAs increase photosensitivity (likelihood to burn or age prematurely due to sun damage), we usually recommend you use AHAs once a day, maximum, at night only. BHAs can be used twice a day, as tolerated. Retinoids should be used as prescribed by your doctor. Retinol (over-the-counter retinoids, much weaker) can be used once a day, PM only. Physical exfoliation should be limited to 2-3x a week, as tolerated. However, if you find that you're getting irritation, back down on all forms of exfoliation and allow your skin to heal (2-3 weeks). Re-introduce the products slowly, and use less frequently. Example: if you were using an AHA once a day, try it every other day or every third day. Not all skin can tolerate frequent exfoliation.\n\n* **When should I see a dermatologist?** When your skin does not respond to gentle at-home treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or alpha hydroxy acid, and you have weeded out any possible irritants. Remember that skin is an organ too, and sometimes it needs a doctor's help to heal. \n\n    I also strongly recommend doing as much research as possible on a doctor before you make an appointment. If you are in the US, you can use resources such as [Vitals.com](http://www.vitals.com/), [ZocDoc.com](http://www.zocdoc.com/), and [HealthGrades.com](http://www.healthgrades.com/) to determine if the doctor you're considering may be a good fit. \n\n    If you already have a dermatologist and are on a prescribed treatment, do not be afraid to call them if the prescribed treatment you are using is not working well for you. You are paying a doctor to help you and work with you -- not to simply throw prescriptions at you. Most importantly, DO NOT be afraid to seek a second opinion or a different doctor if you feel like your current doc does not have your best interest in mind.",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin.

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

My usual routine with actives like salicylic acid which helped me in my teenage years didn’t really help. \n\nA dermatologist recommended i try using Differin and Benzoyl peroxide 4% face wash as my first line treatment and see how it goes.\n\nI started Differin pretty slowly starting from once a week and building up to every day, by increasing the frequency every week. And i only use the face wash at night.\n\nThe rest of my routine is very bare just a moisturizer, sun screen and micellar water if i wear make up. I rarely wear any make up on my acne areas because I’m scared of potential breakouts. \n\nMoisturizer - PURITO Oat-In Calming Gel\nSunscreen - Mary&May CICA Soothing Sun Cream SPF50+\n\nSince my skin has stabilized Im looking to add something to my am routine that could help with fading scars or something that can help with collagen production.

(please excuse the tears, crying over skin is rough (,: )\n\nit might not look like a lot but for my whole life i never ever had a problem with acne except for my forehead. my cheeks , nose and chin were pretty my\nmuch the only thing i ever really liked about my face because they used to be so soft. were never dry, never ever had any breakouts. the only problem i really had was my forehead. \n\never since i went through puberty, my forehead has always been bumpy and never been smooth. im 19 in a couple months. this was my routine:\n\n1. cerave moisturising hydrating cleanser\n2. cerave moisturising lotion\n\nand that was it. it was simple, and it was perfect. though, it didnt help with my oily forehead.\n\ni recently got a good paying job and ive always wanted to do something about my forehead bumpiness because its been something ive been insecure about for a while. i'd seen glass skin on tiktok and i fell into a hole of splurging money on some new products to achieve that same glass skin , thinking i could fix my forehead with it. so i got a bunch of new things and started a new routine:\n\nAM:\n  \n1. cosrx daily salicylic acid cleanser\n2. isntree hyaluronic acid aqua gel cream\n\nPM:\n1. anua heartleaf pore control cleansing oil\n2. cosrx daily salicylic acid cleanser\n3. isntree hyaluronic acid aqua gel cream\n\nand within the first two days of using the SA cleanser my skin was going crazy. it was red, inflamed, but i heard something called 'purging' from salicylic acid and thought it was that. so i had faith and kept using that routine for the next 2 weeks.\n\nmy skin was far worse than when i started. my forehead looked horrible and had lots of cystic acne and even more closed comedones, and the worst part is that my jaw and cheeks , which i was already super happy with, started getting extremely rough and bumpy, and even worse, my cheeks were burning and on fire when i put my moisturiser on.\n\ni had thought it was the SA cleanser that was ruining my skin, so i changed it and started using round lab's dokdo cleanser in the AM and PM. \n\nthe only thing it did was stop my skin from burning when i applied moisturiser, but the texture of my skin was still ruined.\n\ni dont know what is wrong. i dont know if the oil cleanser clogged my pores (i applied it on dry skin, rubbed in for 3 minutes and emulsified with a splash of water and did everything i was meant to) , i dont know if its because i ruined my skin barrier by using salicylic acid everyday (which i learnt you are not supposed to do), i dont know if it was the moisturiser. but im so heartbroken. \n\ni went back to my old cerave routine after being so frustrated and wasting my money on products that didnt even work for me. i thought it would help me restore my skin barrier. my forehead looks a bit better but it seems as if the bumpiness and roughness is travelling from up my jaw all the way up to my entire cheeks.\n\ni really dont know what to do. im really scared i completely ruined my once beautiful soft skin forever and im so frustrated that nothing is working for me so far. any input and any advice would be greatly appreciated (,: thank you for reading",

BIG NO-NO for sensitive skin!!\n* **TIPS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:** personally, i try to keep the chemical exfoliants i use limited to one or two skincare steps/products and often take breaks between uses every few days.\n   * i find that i tolerate SA and other chemical exfoliants best when they are in serum or toner form, followed by HA serum or other moisture-retaining ingredients.\n   * i'll also target my use of SA or another exfoliant to specific problem areas (like the T-zone), and/or use a *very* sparse amount on the rest of my face.\n\n# ISSUE 2: Antagonistic Ingredients/Products\n\n* **SA** → See above.\n* **Cleansing Oil** → you say your forehead has always been \"rough and bumpy,\" indicating a problem spot for oil production. i have this issue too from time to time. using a cleansing oil is probably not going to help with that, but it can help with moisture retention and removing impurities caused by pollution and makeup.\n   * honestly, there's no real need to include a cleansing oil in your regular routine unless you wear face makeup daily or live in a really polluted area.\n      * a good foaming cleanser for sensitive skin and a clean, manual cleansing brush (used lightly without too many additional exfoliants) will do the trick. if you're not permanently terrified of Korean skincare products, you might find some success with [this fragrance-free cleanser for sensitive skin by cosRX](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091YL4GJ8/?coliid=I1TWSPB9LYH3VF&colid=7HKH9R8FRA6H&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_gv_ov_lig_pi_dp). i love it!\n      * you can get the same effect with an oil balm/cleansing sherbet (i like [this one](https://banilausa.com/products/clean-it-zero-cleansing-balm-purifying?variant=31666699993197)) as with a cleansing oil. cleansing balms have the same hydrating benefits and similarly make cleansing the skin from makeup easier, but give the user more control by requiring less product than just a regular cleansing oil...all without the drawbacks of heaviness and over-oiling.\n   * i also seriously doubt there is such a thing as a \"pore control\" cleansing oil that doesn't have some sort of anti-comedogenic properties, like tea tree oil which is a great ingredient but in certain concentrations, it can mess with skin pH and dry out skin. what people think of as \"large pores\" are usually just visible sebaceous filaments, which are honestly good for your skin but can be *visibly* reduced by less aggressive ingredients than SA.\n   * **MAIN ISSUE HERE:** prior to your use of SA as a chemical exfoliant in your cleanser, which (as a cleanser) is also physically exfoliating your skin through the lathering process, you're using a cleansing oil that is likely drying. this clearly results in over-drying and stripping your skin barrier of hydration which cannot be supplemented by something as light as a water cream. additionally, any hydrating benefits your cleansing oil may have are negligible and canceled out by the chemical/manual exfoliation you do twice a day with the SA cleanser.\n* **HA water/gel cream moisturizer →** i do see you tried to supplement the drying issue by including an HA heavy water/gel cream. that's great! your instincts here were on point. HA is a lightly hydrating and firming ingredient, and in a water cream it'd be perfect giving balanced hydration to oil-prone skin (like your \"rough and bumpy\" forehead) *IF AND ONLY IF* you didn't overexpose your skin to exfoliants every day.\n   * **MAIN ISSUE HERE:** because of how frequently you strip your skin barrier,\n      * you may be more sensitive to things like fragrance in moisturizers/serums which will exacerbate irritation\n      * you won't get much hydration from HA in any form, nonetheless in a non-comedogenic water/gel cream intended to be light and balancing for sensitive and oil-prone skin under the *best* of circumstances.\n\n# ISSUE 3: Potential Allergies/Sensitivities\n\n* the last thing to consider is whether you may have an allergy to any of the carrier ingredients. cosRX fortunately lists a lot of their ingredients in English, but they don't list the concentrations. talking to a dermatologist about this may help!\n* many people are sensitive to fragrance, which is one of the most common ingredients in *any* skincare product. the products you used previously (Cerave line) are intentionally low on fragrance, hence why you may have never had much of an issue with acne, irritation, or other types of skin inflammation. again, try to talk to a dermatologist about this\n\n^((READ REPLIES FOR HOW TO FIX YOUR ISSUE))",

Just because something is popular doesn’t meen you need it.\n\nThe science behind this unfortunate event is this: Since your cheeks were not oily, using sebum controlling agents ripped the moisturising oils from your skin and this caused your skin to aggressively produce sebum to put back the moisture that was taken. Your pores enlarged to bring more oils to your epidermis, they got clogged with the overproduced sebum and became acne. As someone with oily skin, i used to use harsh soap bars to rip oil off my skin, but that just causes skin to produce more oil to replace the previous ones. Because skin is not dead.\n\nI recommend seeing a dermatologist, it is the best advice i can give to you. I hope you start loving your skin again as soon as possible",

If there was nothing wrong with your skin (which looked fantastic in the before pictures), the real problem is 1) starting too many new things at once and 2) using things not even for your skin type (why a cleansing oil? Why a salicylic cleanser? Etc). Your skin got harassed and reacted back - not only is there purging going on with the acne but there's barrier issues too. Just cut everything down and go back to what you were doing before and don't get dragged into social media bs.

Repair the skin barrier by looking up how to do so or u can try out the Ordinary's skin barrier support serum. Once the skin barrier is better (two months, after your periods), and you've been using your regular routine that whole time, if there's any skin concerns left, then address those with SERUMS only (salicylic or bha for acne, aha for roughness, vit c for dullness and marks, hyaluronic acid for moisture).

It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics.

    "body": "\\*disclaimer: All of this is just my own experience and your mileage may vary. By cystic acne I mean the deep, painful bumps (\"blind\" pimples) that never come to a head\n\nWhen I turned 25 I started getting deep, painful cysts on my chin, and I’ve probably read every single post on this subreddit related to cystic acne. I have finally found a solution that works for me. \n\n**The Method:**\n\nDo this as soon as you feel a “blind”, deep zit forming under the skin (even if you can’t see it or it doesn’t hurt yet). Before bed, prepare and drink a cup of chamomile tea (I use Bigelow Sweet Dreams tea). After you are done with the warm tea bag, press and hold it to the zit for about 30 seconds to a minute. Repeat nightly as needed. \n\nThat’s it! Without fail this makes the zit noticeably smaller and less painful within 1-2 nights. Typically within 3-4 nights I stop treating it altogether because I don't need to anymore! And this is for cysts that would typically be painful and inflamed for weeks. \n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Warm compresses weren’t working for me initially, and I figured out it was because I wasn’t being gentle enough. The tea bag should be comfortably warm but not too hot, otherwise it will just irritate things more. \n* Similarly, hold the tea bag gently against the skin but do not press too hard. This will just make it worse.\n* I’ve tried this for whiteheads too and it can be useful for drawing them to a head, but this method is much more effective for cystic acne\n* Using chamomile tea as opposed to a different tea is important and doing it before bed is most effective for me. Sometimes I also do a morning round of this treatment or try ginger green tea, but it doesn’t seem to work as well\n* Do not touch the zit at all the rest of the day. \n* This can be drying to the skin, especially after multiple nights in a row, so it’s important to moisturize. I like La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 for when skin gets flaky \n* Usually some pigmentation is left behind for weeks even after the cyst has flattened out, but that’s very easy to cover up with makeup. I like Clinique Redness Solutions Makeup\n\n**My experience with other solutions I have tried:** \n\nHydrocolloid bandages\n\n* This is the one other semi-useful treatment I’ve tried. These are supposed to be for white heads but some people swear they are useful for cysts, too. It might just be that having one on keeps you from touching/picking. Note: Zit stickers with “spikes” to penetrate deeper, like Zisticka, have not been useful and have just made my zits even more irritated. \n\nCold compresses/ice\n\n* This has never worked for me at all, and the cold seems to “firm up” the cyst even more for some reason. It seems to be heat that does the trick. \n\nCortisone Shot from a dermatologist\n\n* I did this once for a particularly bad cyst and had good results, but this is in no way a long term solution for something that happens regularly. I would recommend this in an emergency- like if it’s right before your wedding- but the tea bag method makes it so my cysts don’t ever get big enough for this to be necessary! \n\nTretinoin\n\n* I had already been on Tret .05% for a year when I started getting these cysts, so this hasn’t been a solution. Maybe my cystic acne would have been worse if I wasn't on Tret, though.\n\nAzelaic acid\n\n* I have been using prescription azelaic acid (finacea) for about a year (which is also supposed to be more effective combined with tret). I can’t really say whether or not it helps with the cysts. I definitely still get them.\n\nRosehip Oil\n\n* Is supposed to reduce redness and help with cystic acne. This wasn’t particularly useful for me, and I’m in fact wary of this making my oily T-Zone even worse by putting an oil on it. I do put rosehip oil on my cheeks every night because I don’t get acne there, and it’s very moisturizing. \n\nDiet\n\n* I had been eating a whole food plant based (vegan) diet for about a year when I started getting these cysts, so a healthy diet unfortunately did not protect me. I tried a completely oil free/fat free vegan diet for a few weeks when my cystic acne was particularly bad (look up Nina and Randa Nelson) but this didn’t noticeably help, and also wasn’t sustainable long term for me. I do recommend eating a whole food plant based diet for skin and general health (dairy is supposed to be particularly bad for acne), but it’s not a cure all. I definitely treat myself occasionally to dessert/fast food, and my skin is overall very clear, so I think for most people it’s really not necessary to eat perfectly. \n\nSpearmint tea/spearmint capsules\n\n* Spearmint is supposed to have an anti-androgen effect that prevents cysts. I tried this for several weeks and I’m not sure this was helping at all, and even if it was I don’t like spearmint tea enough to commit to drinking it every single day long term. I similarly don’t want to commit to buying spearmint pills for the rest of my life. This does seem to work for some people, though. \n\nRed Light therapy\n\n* I have a red light that I sit in front of sometimes because it’s supposed to reduce inflammation. I have no idea if it helps or not, and is definitely not a solution for my \\`cystic acne.\n\nDermatologist\n\n* My experience going to a dermatologist about my cystic acne wasn’t good. He recommended I go on antibiotics (amoxycyllin), but I didn’t view this as a long term solution because I expected the acne would just come back after the antibiotics were over. He also prescribed me a topical antibiotic (clindamycin), which would probably help with white heads but isn’t useful for the deep cysts I was regularly getting.\n\nPillowcases/Laundry\n\n* I switched to satin pillowcases and I wash them every single week using a hypoallergenic laundry detergent (seventh generation free and clear). I dry them using dryer balls instead of dryer sheets so that they don’t get coated in wax. I can’t say whether this is making a difference or not, but I’d recommend giving it a try. \n\n**Things I’ve tried for cystic acne that were totally ineffective:**\n\n* Sulfur ointment\n* Tea tree oil\n* Salicylic acid (does’t work for deep cysts)\n* Benzoyl peroxide (doesn’t work for deep cysts)\n* Aztec healing clay\n* Hemorrhoid cream\n* Diaper rash cream\n* Both prescription strength and drugstore hydrocortisone\n* Basically I recommend just not bothering with anything topical for deep cysts. None of these things made any difference",

If anyone tries this, please keep in mind that zinc depletes copper and you need copper for your blood! So take sparingly or take a multivitamin with copper between zinc days.",

Started getting these painful cystic pimples on my chin - at least one a month, always around ovulation. Period is all wonky, etc. etc. So turns out I have PCOS.\n\nLast Thursday evening I felt a cystic pimple brewing. Tried to treat it with Treclin, but showed no improvement. Went to reddit and found this post. Luckily I had some Chamomile tea my mom gave me for stress 😁\n\nI brewed the tea, placed the warm (not hot) bag on the cyst and kept it there long after it was cool. Then drank the tea slowly and afterwards took the cold tea bag and applied it again for a number of minutes. Then wiped it clean and applied moisturizer. \n\nI repeated this am and pm for 3 days. By Monday my cyst was almost completely gone except for the discoloration that they often leave. But make-up sorted that out. Usually these cysts lasted for weeks and were just so painful! \n\nSo try it! Don't worry too much about the guidelines. You can't really overdo it. The wonder of Chamomile!\n\nPs. I also started on myo-inositol a few weeks ago hoping to get the hormonal balance too. Already feel so much better.",

Honestly zitstickas HAVE worked well for me (to my surprise); I think it’s something about having it covered for long periods of time so the skin isn’t touched or exposed to other things. I use the “killa” orange zit stickas for deep pimples like as SOON as I feel them forming (sometimes before they are even visible at all) overnight and even during the day sometimes when I have no shame lol. Other little pimple covers of any brand have worked pretty well once zits start coming to a head. \n\nAlso, I’ve made sure to keep my skin well moisturized which I think I neglected in the past (sounds so simple, but maybe I thought of oil clogging pore more than dry skin.. but dry skin does the exact same thing and causes acne). I love using aquaphor on my lips— no other scented chapsticks or anything — and also not afraid to dab a little aquaphor on blemishes near my mouth and nose.\n\nAfter so many years of desperately trying so many things, I think we try to doctor our skin a little too much and end up just irritating it.

I think manny things do not work because it's and insane of bacteria internally and can be pased down by genetics so I found getting tested really helped and going to a disease specialist they can internally medicate the root of the problem as your using topical on the outside or a skin care routine that works best for your skin type.

Gone in two weeks. The gut is where most problems start and a zinc deficiency can wreak havoc on your skin, hair, hormones and immune system. You need to have a 15:1 ratio of zinc to copper and although there is plenty of copper rich foods, there aren't many with zinc, so most people end up zinc deficient and imbalanced and thus skin issues like acne, psoriasis, eczema, etc. If you have celiac like me, nutrient deficiences can be even worse. Zinc picolinate is more absorbable. Hope that helps!",

    "body": "Get Rid of STRAWBERRY LEGS 101:\n\nFirst off, if you know, you know. Strawberry legs refer to a those dark little dots/hair follicles all over your legs. They can be easily irritated and even get inflamed after shaving and/or waxing, causing them to become red and more noticeable. \n\nIn recent years I’ve discovered how much more noticeable mine are, and they became such a pressing issue for me that I began to only wear leggings and jeans. I knew I couldn’t live my life like this all summer, SO, I did the research. I mean, a looooot of research. And I’m going to share with you a routine that gave me noticeable results after only a couple weeks! \n\nDisclaimer: I know this isn’t a one size fits all situation, but based on my own experience and a lot of what I’ve read up on, this seems to work and does not involve making homemade potions or messy/painful/expensive hair removal methods (I.e., waxing, epilating, sugaring, laser). \n\nSTEP 1: \n\nEXFOLIATE. And then exfoliate some MORE. You should exfoliate your legs every time you shower if you want to improve the appearance of your strawberry legs. This is also key to creating a fresh base to apply your products onto. Those little strawberry dots are often filled with dirt, oil, sebum, and dead skin cells. Exfoliating alone will allow you to get a MUCH smoother/closer shave and help avoid razor burn. I use the OGX Coconut Coffee scrub and a loofa. I scrub pretty hard and only in a back and fourth direction going with and against the hair grain. Going in circular motions can confuse the hair follicle and make it more irritated I have found. \n\nStep 2: THE SHAVE \n\nAlways always use a good and fresh razor (I use a Venus 5 blade razor). I store mine outside of the shower and I’m sure to wipe it dry and wipe with alcohol to keep it clean and sharp. When I shave I use a thin layer of cheap hair conditioner and just shave normally against the grain. I find it helps to avoid shaving (while continuing exfoliating) when you can. Although, I still usually shave every other time I shower, because I’m a hairy beast. \n\nSTEP 3: THE HOLY GRAIL PRODUCTS \n\nI SWEAR by the after shave product called Tend Skin. It’s fairly inexpensive and can be found at most drugstores. It’s purpose is to remove razor bumps, and boy does it work fast. I apply it to my whole leg with a cotton pad and then let it air dry. It has an alcohol smell to it but I seriously believe this product has been key to preventing irritation and even aids in deep cleaning the hair follicles (my own thought, not a fact).\n\nAfter applying the Tend Skin, I go in with holy grail product number 2: CeraVe SA Body Lotion for Rough, Bumpy Skin. I bought a value size on Amazon and it has been amazing. It contains salicylic acid and others which chemically exfoliate the skin while also moisturizing. \n\nI have done this routine for 2 weeks now and have seen honestly dramatic results. Let me know if you guys try it! Good luck!",

Finding an affordable way to do this can be a PITA, but products that come in huge containers (like Kiku’s High Moist Toner) help.\n\nApplying alum, like Crystal’s deodorant, afterward can also help.\n\nThe less blades, the better. The more fresh, sharp, and clean the blade(s), the better. Hacks for sharpening razors help them last you a while longer, and I dry it and use rubbing alcohol too to keep it clean.\n\nWhat you use while shaving can also help sometimes. Instead of traditional foam shaving cream, you can use a cream based shaving cream, plain conditioner, oil, more sophisticated lathers, etc. Aim for commercial products meant for sensitive skin if you go that route.\n\nDoing these things addressed the follicle issue, razor burn, ingrowns, KP, and leftover pigmentation issues from those problems for me.\n\nI had to be pretty disciplined at first about it, but eventually I was able to switch to maintenance mode and can be much more lax about it.\n\nI used to use Tend Skin religiously years ago. But it’s mostly just isopropyl alcohol if I recall correctly. Very drying. It can also exasperate issues (though necessarily the exact one you’re trying to address), especially over time. And it’s kind of expensive!",

Using a chemical exfoliator before shaving works 1000x times better imo.

The authentic cap is a warmer white tone, not as transparent from the top, has a smaller nib in the center and a slight different profile internally. \n7. The authentic bottle has a flat bottom complete with an expiration date. \n\nDisclaimer: Because of bottling facility differences etc, these may not all be tell tale signs of a counterfeit of this product. Also the suspected counterfeit could potentially be old stock which could explain the odor and bottling differences. Simply sharing what I noticed!",

Check out the new and vastly improved version here:***\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1bs7nv/the_redditors_guide_to_acne_2013/\n\n---\n\nNote: I read every comment, and I am also regularly editing based on feedback. Please continue to contribute your questions and suggestions, and they will hopefully be addressed either with a response from me, or in updates to the guide. At no point will I consider this complete, so if there are more sections you want to see, or points you want some elaboration on, let me know.\n\n-------\nMost of us have gotten a lot of useful life tips from reddit, and it’s certainly a great source of collective knowledge on many topics. But there’s one thing that I’ve noticed people here are not good at: acne. The best we’ve managed as a collective is \"put a clean towel on your pillow every night\". But in reality, there is no cure, and no one simple thing is going to change that. Acne is caused and helped by different things for different people. Dirty skin is not likely to be the real cause, so slight hygiene improvements can only help so much. Generally speaking, what works for someone else won't work for you, and sometimes most of the things that SHOULD work don't. I know how frustrating that is, having tried numerous products over the past few years, and finding that even the best ones don't help, or lead to more problems. It's made especially hard because the Internet is filled with misinformation and ignorance about how to treat acne, and it can be nearly impossible for most people to distinguish the good advice from the baseless crap that makes up 90% of acne-related websites. \n\nI've tried to extract the useful information from all this, approaching the problem from various angles rather than recommending a specific product or regimen. Despite what people in almost every reddit acne thread keep telling you (and there has been a lot of awful advice in those threads), there is no miracle product or easy fix. You need to understand a lot more about skin care and acne before you can understand how to treat your own problems, and what you do will depend on your skin type and the nature of your acne.\n\n**Basic Acne Treatment**\n\nBefore continuing, I suggest reading [this](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/best-acne-fighting-products.aspx) summary of acne, its causes, and most of the treatments available for it. [Acne.org](http://www.acne.org/), though questionable at times, is worth reading through for more info. It also has user reviews of every product, home remedy and other treatment, both internal and external. [This thread](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/index.php/topic/102347-biggest-mistakes-people-make-to-treat-acne/) addresses a lot of the common mistakes you may be making. The forums CAN provide useful information like that, but be careful, as there's also a lot of unreliable advice and anecdotes. Remember, what works for someone else may not work for you, and sometimes people make mistakes when assessing their own results.\n\nYou can get a reasonable amount of detail from those links (and more from checking Wikipedia/Google results for anything listed there), and I suggest reading them before this FAQ. I'm just going to summarise the pros and cons of some common acne treatments. (You can see a fairly comprehensive list [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Acne_agents).)\n\n*Benzoyl Peroxide (BP)*\n\n* Examples: [Acne.org](http://www.danielkern.com/product-p/treatment-8.htm), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/product/clear-acne-fighting-treatment/acne-treatment-clear-skin), [Serious Skin Care](http://www.seriousskincare.com/product_p/clearzitnano.htm) (5% only, but no other product effectively combines benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil), [Oxy](http://www.oxyskincare.com/our-products/oxy-clinical-clearing-treatment/) (5% only), [ProActiv](http://www.proactiv.com)\n\nPros:\n\n* Kills acne bacteria better than anything else you can get OTC, strong support from studies.\n* Also has some keratolytic effects due to its skin peeling properties, so it can clear pores.\n* Widely available and commonly used, relative to comparable products.\n\nCons:\n\n* Dries out skin\n* High sun sensitivity (use sunscreen)\n* Bleaches clothes and sheets\n* It can be harsh, irritating and drying: many people will have some kind of negative reaction, and those who are allergic or have sensitive skin can't tolerate it at all. (I don't use BP for this reason. If you do, I recommend trying a 2.5% product, as stronger ones have worse side effects, and there's little evidence that they're more effective.)\n\n*Salicylic Acid / Beta Hydroxy Acid / BHA*\n\nExamples: [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/category/bha-aha-exfoliants), [Neutrogena](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/oil-free+acne+stress+control-+3-in-1+hydrating+acne+treatment.do)\n\nPros:\n\n* Best exfoliant: helps remove dead skin and encourage new growth, which both prevents pore blocking and improves hyperpigmentation (red/dark marks).\n* Unclogs pores and restores them to their healthy size/funtion, excellent for blackheads/whiteheads.\n* Anti-inflammatory.\n* Can and should be spread all over the face to improve appearance and smoothness, not just as a spot treatment.\n\nCons:\n\n* Sun sensitivity (always use sunscreen!)\n* Still can't be used by some, especially if you have an aspirin allergy or salicylate sensitivity\n\n*Other Exfoliant Info*\n\n* Alpha Hydroxy Acids (usually glycolic or lactic acid) are an alternative if your skin can't tolerate BHAs, but do not penetrate as deep into the skin, so they don't work as well against acne (but they do help with surface damage).\n* Physical scrubs only exfoliate superficially, not penetrating the skin like AHAs/BHAs, and their abrasive nature also means they can be more irritating (and more likely to accidentally scrub pimples), so these are not recommended. If you are going to go with a scrub, try to make it a fairly gentle one, or just use a washcloth with your cleanser.\n* I don't want to advocate specific brands for the most part, but most BHA products have too high a pH to exfoliate, or contain ingredients that make acne worse. Good ones are hard to find, so I would recommend getting them from Paula's Choice. They're the only brand that has a few different products with varying strengths (1%/2%) and bases (liquid/gel/lotion), so you can find the right fit for your skin type.\n* Start by using them once a day, at night, and if necessary, adjust the frequency based on how your skin responds.\n\n*Tea Tree Oil*\n\nPros:\n\n* [Functionally comparable to benzoyl peroxide.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2145499) \n* Doesn't have the drying or irritating side effects of BP\n\nCons:\n\n* Weaker than BP; takes longer to work and may have a lower success rate.\n* Lack of good tea tree products available, most are unlikely to be effective. \n* Highly volatile, may lose effectiveness from exposure to light or air. Be careful with the below method; buy small quantities and store it carefully.\n\nThe best way to get around the poor availability of good products is to buy 100% tea tree oil, and dilute it to 5% (i.e. 1:19) concentration in a carrier oil, such as jojoba. (Camellia oil and grape seed oil are a couple touted for their skin benefits, but I'm not sure if they block pores.) A few drops of jojoba can double as a light, noncomedogenic moisturiser, suitable even for oily skin. You don't really want to be using creams and lotions on oily skin anyway, as they risk making it oilier or clogging pores. I wouldn't rush to add TTO to other skin products, unless you just mix them in your hands before application. \n\nA similar product, called manuka oil, is made from a New Zealand plant (usually used to make a highly antibacterial honey), rather than the Australian tea tree. I haven't heard much about this being used for acne, but if anyone has tried it, let me know how it went. It's possible that this is just as effective as tea tree, or more so, but either it's obscure because of the lack of studies on it, or has so few studies on it because it's obscure.\n\n*Azelaic Acid*\n\nPros:\n\n* Combines some of the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and exfoliant/pore-clearing effects of the above products (I believe you need sunscreen with it for similar reasons).\n* Generally well-tolerated, usable on sensitive skin.\n* Very effective for hyperpigmentation left behind by acne (currently considered a possible safer alternative to hydroquinone for skin lightening)\n\nCons:\n\n* Poor availability: Whether it's OTC or prescription-only varies with the country. So far, the only place I know for certain it's OTC is Australia, where you can get the 20% lotion (Azclear) or 15% gel (Finacea). Some online stores will ship these internationally. I wasn't really sure whether this belonged here or in the prescription treatment section, but if you do reach the point of needing prescription topicals, this is a really good one to try anyway.\n* Some people may have bad side effects, especially in the first couple of weeks. I find it needs to be followed with a moisturiser.\n* Relative lack of research into its usage, effectiveness and precautions. Generally speaking, fewer people seem to have used it, so it's hard to assess how good it is.\n\nRemember that any of these will most likely take several weeks to start working, as acne that is already forming can take some time to come to the surface. If you want to know where to start, I suggest salicylic acid (or an AHA), then if it doesn't do enough on its own, try combining it with tea tree oil or BP. Azelaic acid is a great alternative, if you can get access to it. If these fail, you may want to see a doctor or dermatologist for stronger options. Before you do any of this, though, I recommend reading through the next few sections that cover how to look after your health, hygiene and skin in a way that will minimise your acne, which may save you needing to go further or spend more money.\n\n(Continued in the comments.)",

        "body": "**Skin Care**\n\nSo, you heard from someone (or from reddit) that Product X fixed all their problems, or you saw an ad that seemed like the answer to all your problems, or something just caught your eye on a store shelf. The first thing you want to know is if the product's claims are true, or just marketing bullshit. I would typically look it up on [Beautypedia](http://www.beautypedia.com/) first, which gives you an ingredient list and a basic assessment of those ingredients. (I'd love to include other comprehensive professional review sites here to account for possible bias/error, but I don't think there are any.) There are also a lot of options for [searching](http://www.beautypedia.com/AdvancedSearch.aspx) based on your skin type, the type of product you're looking for, and even particular ingredients you want or don't want, giving you a list of options to check out. If the brand you're looking for isn't there (more likely if you're outside America), you can look up ingredients on [Cosmetics Cop](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/A.aspx), which summarises most known info and studies on skin care ingredients. Sites like [Cosmeticsinfo.org](http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/) and [Personal Care Truth](http://personalcaretruth.com/) can complement this nicely if you want more in-depth scientific analysis, or just more information on something you're unsure of.\n\nI won't recommend specific brands or products, because really, while a certain one may work very well for a particular person, there is no \"special\" one. You just have to experiment. No product is unique, as the same ingredients can usually be found elsewhere. Also, every brand has both good and bad products, so you do need to check the specific stuff you're using rather than getting your entire regimen from one line.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, but MAKE SURE YOUR ACNE IS NOT BEING WORSENED BY ANY OF YOUR SKIN CARE PRODUCTS. So many people start with minimal acne, but they respond to it with bad products, which block pores or irritate their skin, leading them into a cycle of worse and worse acne. And yes, anything can be doing this - it doesn't matter if it says \"non-comedogenic\", \"hypoallergenic\", or \"natural\", as these terms aren't strictly defined or regulated. They're basically marketing lingo made to convince you that you're getting something \"safe\". While acne's primary cause is hormonal, many other things can exacerbate it by blocking pores or causing irritation that leads to increased sebum production. If you have sensitive skin, just about anything could be a culprit, especially cleansers. You can also save yourself a lot of time in checking new products by making sure they include none of the ingredients listed [here](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/skin-irritation-your-worst-enemy.aspx). These are less of a concern at the end of the ingredients list, though, as this implies a very small quantity. The first thing you should do if you think there may be a problem with your current products is to stop using anything containing [fragrance](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mjl/adv/2007/00000087/00000004/art00005), probably the most common cause of reactions that is unfortunately used very frequently.\n\n*Basic Skin Care Routine* \n\nThis is just a term I'm using to define, basically, a springboard from which you can modify and add products and steps as you experiment with your acne treatment. This really consists of three things that you need to get down before you start introducing anti-acne products and experimenting with other additions and substitutions. The idea is to start by using as few things on your skin as possible, then slowly adding more to see how they affect your skin.\n\nHere's what you need:\n\n* A gentle cleanser suited for your skin type. Avoid harsh, irritating/drying detergent cleansing agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate. Most of the others are considered less irritating, but there are some, like sodium laureth sulfate, that may be a bad idea for very sensitive skin. Note that an anti-acne cleanser is not necessary, and probably not even very effective, as the best anti-acne products need to be left on your skin to really work. Pick gentle/sensitive skin cleansers over acne-focused ones. Preferably don't use a bar soap, as many of these risk drying, irritating or blocking pores.\n* A toner or light moisturiser, depending on whether your skin is dry enough to need a moisturiser. If you have combination skin, you should treat the dry and oily areas differently. If you use a toner, make sure it doesn't contain alcohol or any other irritants. A toner has the benefit of not risking blocking pores. Jojoba oil is also a popular alternative. I find the easiest way to treat oily skin is to only apply a very thin layer of moisturiser (something like CeraVe or acne.org's moisturiser, or anything without oils in it).\n* Sunscreen (also covered in another section). This can and should be included in your moisturiser during the day, but not at night, so you may need two different moisturisers. (Note that there are moisturisers with sunscreen specifically for oily skin.)\n\nRemember, breakouts usually don't happen overnight, as acne can take weeks to form below the surface. This makes it very hard to actually identify whether something new is helping or hurting, so you may need to use something for a few weeks and see what happens. While a good product will take time to work, don't be fooled by claims of \"purging\". If you get *worse*, i.e. breaking out immediately from something new, stop using it.\n\n*Shaving* (for men)\n\nA lot of shaving products and aftershaves contain irritants, as well as razors themselves. The trend of adding more and more blades has really led to more irritating shaves, which isn't helped by the fact that these blades encourage you to rush and to push too hard on the skin. Two blades will lead to fewer problems than five blades. Better yet, though, check out /r/wicked_edge and get yourself a double edge safety razor. (I use an Edwin Jagger DE89BL, but see that subreddit for more details on everything you need and how to use it.) Learning how to shave in a totally new way takes some getting used to, but gives you much more precise control, and a smoother, gentler shave. It's also much cheaper. A good thing to remember is that if you have acne, you should never shave against the grain, as this is a major cause of irritation and ingrown hairs.\n\nJust be wary of the fact that most shaving soaps/creams contain fragrance, menthol, [essential oils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Essential_oils) or other irritants, which should all be avoided. To make matters more frustrating, many do not list ingredients online. Evidently, many people who make shaving products either know shit all about actual skin care, or just don't particularly care about sensitive skin (for which fragrance-free products are a must). There are some good suggestions for things to try in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/ly4mo/are_there_any_good_fragrancefree_shaving_soaps/).\n\n**Sun** \n\nSunscreen is important, and relevant here because skin that is healing from acne is highly susceptible to discolouration and damage that can cause it to age more quickly. This applies every day and all year round, not just in summer. Pretty much every really effective acne treatment increases sun sensitivity, including salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and even oral antibiotics (tetracyclines), so this is a particularly big deal for acne sufferers, and people who no longer have acne but want the redness left behind to heal.\n\nThis may seem straightforward enough, but for acne-prone skin, sunscreen is actually one of the hardest things to get right. Many of them are too thick to use on your face, and if you have sensitive skin, chemical sunscreens (i.e. the vast majority) can be problematic. In that case you would want a physical/mineral sunscreen, with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, but these are the most likely to block pores. Hopefully you won't have to rely on those. (Some of us are less lucky.) A spray or gel can be good for oily skin, but many of these are alcohol-based. What you most likely want is either a very light sunscreen, or a moisturiser with sunscreen that is made for oily skin.\n\nStaying out of the sun to avoid sun damage is also pretty good for your skin. That's right, there are benefits to being a forever alone shut-in spending all day on reddit! (UV rays pass through windows, though, so close your blinds.) Uh, just make sure you take a vitamin D supplement if you're going to do that. Actually, speaking of which...",

At 160 pounds, I would usually be prescribed anywhere from 35mg to 75mg per day (or even more).  However, I have achieved and maintained a clear face with no more than one pimple every couple of months by taking a single 20mg pill every other day (10mg daily dosage).\n\nThe true benefit to low dosages is not just the reduced cost, but the reduced side effects.  After all, the most common reason that I see people avoid accutane is because of these side effects.  Fortunately, with low dosages they are almost always very tolerable.  Personally, the only thing I have experienced is chapped lips.  I'll trade that for clear skin any day.\n\nThe actual dosage that's necessary seems to vary significantly from person to person.  I have seen even less than 5mg per day have a significant effect on some people.  I am not an expert on the product, but I don't see anything wrong with a person experimenting to find the lowest dosage that will work for them, instead of simply going full dosage or nothing.",

Up to you whether or not to leave that coating on for a while or rinse it off, but it worked very well for me.\n\nAlso, use only glycerin soap (or something equally gentle and not full of fake crap). I liked this Aveeno oatmeal bar I had once. And...wash in the morning, upon getting up, and once at night. Maybe just once a day. (Don't wash your face like a crazy person - does more harm than good.)\n\nChanging pillowcases and diet obviously help too.

I read in the newspaper an article from Ann Landers back when she was alive that recommended separating the egg whites from the yolks and spreading the yolk to the affected area.  After it dried, you cleaned it off.  As far as I could tell there were no side effects (no chemicals) besides the gross factor.  It took a few applications, but in a few days my back was cleared up.  May not be useful long term but worked great for me.  Doesn't hurt to try it unless you are allergic to eggs.",

I have tried reducing my routine to only a cleanser and moisturizer but the acne comes raging back. So looks like I’m stuck with having to get the prescription products. I didn’t change my diet at all I just started the morning and night routine. One problem I had is my shaving gel causing acne until I found one that didn’t. For me that was a Gillette shaving gel. I don’t know why that one doesn’t cause acne for me but oh well. ",

    "body": "**Why Skincare Matters (Especially in India)**\n\nIf you think skincare is unimportant, you’re wrong. Every man you idolize online — actors, influencers, athletes — all do some form of skincare (and even makeup sometimes). It’s not “girly” or “sigma” or whatever cringe label people throw around. It’s just hygiene and self-care.\n\nWhy is skincare extra important for Indian guys?\n\t•\tWeather: Sweaty summers, dry winters, crazy humidity — our skin suffers.\n\t•\tPollution: Indian cities = dust, dirt, and pollution constantly clogging your pores.\n\t•\tGenetics: Indian skin is more prone to acne scars, pigmentation, and tanning.\n\t•\tSun Exposure: UV index here is brutal. Skipping sunscreen will make you look like an old leather bag at 30.\n\nTL;DR — Take care of your skin now or regret it later.\n\n\n\n**Skincare Routine for Beginners**\n\n**Before we start**: Identify Your Skin Type & Concern\n\nFirst things first — figure out:\n\t•\tSkin Type: Dry, Oily, Combination, or Normal?\n\t•\tMain Concerns: Acne? Dull skin? Pigmentation? Uneven tone?\n\n**Golden Rule:** Always buy products based on your skin type and concerns — not random Instagram trends.\nIf possible, visit a dermatologist once to get a proper analysis.\n\n**Daily Routine**\n\n**Step 1: Cleanser (AM/PM)**\n\t•\tWash face with a gentle cleanser (like CeraVe).\n\tPM Tip: If you use sunscreen (which you should), double cleanse at night —\n\t1.\tFirst, wipe face with micellar water (like Bioderma).\n\t2.\tThen, cleanse with face wash.\n\t•\tOn extra sweaty/dirty days, I swap my PM cleanser with a Salicylic Acid Cleanser (like Minimalist).\n\n**Step 2: Toner (Optional, AM)**\n\t•\tAfter cleansing, pat face dry with a clean face towel.\n\t•\tUse toner only if needed — for dry skin, I use TONYMOLY Ceramide Mochi Toner. Most people can skip this.\n\n**Step 3: Targeted Serums (AM/PM)**\n\nSerums = Targeted treatment for specific concerns. Choose based on your needs:\n\t•\tHydration: Hyaluronic Acid\n\t•\tBrightening: Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Kojic Acid\n\t•\tExfoliation (2x a week): Glycolic Acid\n\t•\tAcne Treatment: Salicylic Acid, Tea Tree Oil\n\nWhat I use:\n\t•\tAM: Vitamin C (daily)\n\t•\tPM: Salicylic Acid (3x/week) & Glycolic Acid (2x/week)\n\n**Step 4: Moisturizer (AM/PM)**\n\t•\tAfter serum, always moisturize.\n\t•\tI use:\n\t•\tCetaphil DAM (for normal to dry skin)\n\t•\tBioderma Atoderm Crème Ultra (heavy-duty)\n\n**Step 5: Sunscreen (AM only — non-negotiable)**\n\t•\tFor dry/normal skin: Cream-based sunscreen\n\t•\tFor oily/combination skin: Gel-based sunscreen\n\t•\tMinimum: SPF 50 + PA+++\n\nI use UV Doux Gel Sunscreen — works well, non-sticky.\nAvoid influencer hype brands. Stick to reliable drugstore options.\n\n\n**Haircare Routine**\n\n\n**Step 1: Shampoo**\n\t•\tFrequency depends on sweat/dirt. Generally, 2x a week works.\n\t•\tUse sulfate & paraben-free shampoo.\n\t•\tPersonally, for my thick, wavy hair, only L’Oréal Professional Range shampoos make my scalp feel truly clean.\n\n**Step 2: Conditioner**\n\t•\tEvery time you shampoo, follow it up with conditioner.\n\n**Step 3: Leave-in Conditioner / Hair Serum**\n\t•\tNot mandatory, but if you have dry hair, it’s a game-changer.\n\n**Step 4: Hair Mask (Optional)**\n\t•\tFor very dry/damaged hair, use a mask once a week.\n\n\n\n**Grooming Essentials**\n\n**Lip Care**\n\t•\tAM: Apply Nivea Original Care lip balm.\n\t•\tPM: Use plain old Vaseline or Boroline before bed.\n\n**Shaving (for clean-shaven guys)**\n\t•\tUse a good razor —  I use the Gillette Fusion 5 Power.\n\t•\tShaving foam? Try Gillette Charcoal Foam (cooling effect is elite).\n\t•\tAfter shave, apply an after shave lotion followed by a moisturizer.\n\n**Beard Care (for my beard bros)**\n\t•\tGet a good quality Philips Trimmer (adjustable heads are clutch for styling).\n\n**Body Grooming**\n\t•\tGet a ceramic blade trimmer for body hair.\n\t•\tAlso, invest in a nose/ear trimmer (trust me — game changer).\n\n**Extra Hygiene Tips**\n\nDeo/Roll-on\n\t•\tMy picks: Nivea Maxx Fresh or Rexona Men or Chemist at Play 5% AHA (for dark pits)\n\nOral Hygiene\n\t•\tFloss before brushing. Brush for 2 mins. Use a tongue cleaner. Follow up with a mouthwash.\n\nSmelling Good\n\t•\tMix a few drops of Plum body oil into your body lotion.\n\t•\tOr invest in a good perfume (r/DesiFragranceAddicts has great recos).\n\n**Final Advice**\n\nSkincare & grooming aren’t “cringe” — they’re basic self-respect.\nTake care of yourself and you’ll naturally feel more confident. Whether you’re trying to impress your crush, glow up for college, or just feel good in your own skin - you may even end up getting the baddie too😉\n\nNeed product recos? You can head over to r/IndianSkincareAddicts .\n\n**I know my personal routine might seem expensive for a lot of teenagers, and trust me, I get it. But I’ve chosen to invest in myself because I see it as a long-term investment in my confidence and appearance. That being said, you absolutely don’t need to spend this much to build a solid routine. There are plenty of budget-friendly products that work just as well, especially if you focus on the basics — cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Skincare doesn’t have to break the bank.**",

TL;DR: check the ingredients in your body wash!\n\nI (F27) have struggled with back acne my entire adult life. Note: I know I didn’t have this issue as a teenager, because I worked as a lifeguard from 15-19 and could regularly see my back in a swimsuit - no issues. I also remember being super careful with my face as a teen, mainly because ads for cleansers and systems were everywhere, and also because so many of my friends struggled with facial acne. \n\nI was very lucky to never have a major facial acne problem, just the occasional breakout (which I still get to this day) BUT I think the faith in my routine/products may have been my downfall! \n\nI distinctly remember there being some kind of promotion/deal from a brand (won’t say which as I don’t want to slam them, and it’s truly not their products that are the issue) where you bought the body wash, and you got a free facial cleanser/exfoliated. I remember buying it, enjoying it, and never thinking twice about it. \n\nIn university, I gained the freshman 15 and also started noticing back acne, but didn’t think much of it - I obviously wasn’t eating very well and also not taking great care of myself, between the many classes I thought I could handle, the late nights drinking, and the messed up sleep schedule. \n\nBut even after university, the bacne remained - I thought I was dirty, that I wasn’t doing a good job of keeping myself clean, that I needed to wash my clothes/bras more often, that I needed to get a special back scrubber. I tried all those things, but as often happens when we don’t feel too good about our bodies: I gave up and accepted that I would never wear anything backless, I’d wear cover ups with bathing suits, etc. \n\nOne month ago: I pop into my local drug store to pick up some more body wash because I’m out out, and need some ASAP. Alas; they are out of my brand that I have been using for 13 years! Im totally thrown, about to spiral in a drug store - when I see another pink bottle, that also is grapefruit-scented, and has the (environmentally-friendly) little scrubbing beads in it. I grab it, close enough. \n\nFolks. It has been just over 3 weeks and my bacne is almost completely cleared up. I called my best friend crying because I had truly thought I was going to be mortified to wear the low-backed bridesmaid dress she had picked for her wedding this fall, and now I have hope! The secret ingredient? After a little digging, it seems to be salicylic acid - and part of my relief is that it wasn’t my habits, it wasn’t my level of hygiene, it was just that one key ingredient. \n\nSorry for the novel, I’m honestly just still processing a lot of feelings about this. I hope it can help someone avoid frustration and body-negativity!",

That body wash cleared it right up. \n\nIf salicylic acid doesn't clear your acne, switch to benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide is great for stubborn acne. Both salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide come in many different forms. And benzoyl comes in different strengths. It might be a process, and one product may not work, but another might. Just give it a few weeks to work. \n\nHowever, with both treatments, make sure you use sunscreen! They make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Skin cancer is no joke and will make your acne seem insignificant and the least of your problems. Skin dryness can occur and don't forget to moisturize.\n\nIf you have sensitive skin. You can spot wash these areas and there are fragrance and dye free acne treatments. Pay attention to your skin. It will tell you when you've over done it with products. Hives and skin irritation can look like acne.",

Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

    "body": "Hi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories. They all use the patented ceramides.\n\n* [**RealBarrier's Extreme Cream**](http://www.atopalmglobal.com/product/proDetail.asp?brand=3&cate=332&Pcate=217&Mcate=) \\#3 Top Creams (4.11/5 out of 6,153 Reviews) **fragranced**  [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/REAL-BARRIER-Extreme-Cream-50ml-BEST-Korea-Cosmetic/312419244657?epid=1740451843&hash=item48bda35a71:g:Kp4AAOSwoEFcM~bo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Aestura Ato Barrier Cream**](https://www.aestura.com/web/product/view.do?prdSeq=1004)  \\#6 Top Creams (4.23/5 out of 2,524 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Mamonde's Moisture Ceramide Intense Cream**](https://www.mamonde.com/int/en/product/ceramide-intense-cream.html) \\#15 Top Creams (3.94/5 out of 2,840 Reviews) **fragranced**    [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/MAMONDE-Ceramide-Intense-Cream-50ml/392296451084?epid=8032468017&hash=item5b56b0cc0c%3Ag%3A9wMAAOSwMMNc2mEr&LH_BIN=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Intensive Cream**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=281) (4.21/5 out of 1,539 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Zeroid's Soothing Cream** (4.12/5 out of 1,768 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Richenic Cream Urea 5%**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284) **-** not many reviews as this is new, but FANTASTIC ingredients.

It doesn't bother her skin, and really helps calm her skin & works well under makeup. She also highly recommends the soothing gel for summer & concentrate cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** (4.20/5 out of 3,162 Reviews)\n\n[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ILLIYOON-Ceramide-Ato-Concentrate-Cream-200ml/132526755796)\n\n[Apmall](http://global.amorepacificmall.com/en/shop/pr/illiyoon/P000006418/shop_product_view.do?i_sProductcd=P000006418)\n\n[Mini-review by Dr. Dray @ 13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1X4RmFTJQ8&t=877s)\n\nThis cream has little beads in it that break up when you apply, according to reviewers. Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the \"scrubby bits\" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.\n\nWhile Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**\n\n>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk. But if you count it, then there are more options, like [Gold Bond Men's Essentials](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-men-s-essentials-hand-face-and-body-lotions-14-5oz/-/A-14507966), or the [Strength & Resilience Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-strength-and-resilienc-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-16453690) and [Unscented Diabetic Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-gold-bond-diabetic-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-15025375) (EDIT: AND [Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion for face](https://www.target.com/p/cetaphil-moisturizing-lotion-unscented-16oz/-/A-10300852)) for fragrance-free options.\n\n[Triderma Eczema Fast Healing Face % Body Cream](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991)\\- not sure %, but it looks pretty high. I actually have the old version of this, before they reformulated. It used to have 3% colloidal oatmeal!!!!!!!!! Which is higher than any I've seen at the time.

I tried so many creams before my skin met whatever’s in the Neopharm “ceramide complex” and nothing compares besides Ceradan \n\nThanks for writing this up!",

But patented just means proprietary to me, and I've learned to distrust that in skincare. It's a lot like a \"you don't need to know\" and a head pat. It's nice to see some positive reviews here, especially from people experienced with more than one of the above products - but it's not like we can't find a billion glowing reviews of Cerave, either.",

Not to mention you can easily get 200ml tube for $15 and that's a good deal. The capsules inside confused me at first tho lol. Apart from that, that cream can be boring for some, but it worked for me in -15°C winter days and saved my face, that's a feat. I sometimes go ham on the amount I put on my face tho, and I wouldn't recommend that. It's not an oily cream but you can feel when you go overboard.",

Personal reviews can be very helpful, but after seeing my billionth \"OMG L-AA worked for me overnight!\" review (no, it almost certainly didn't, it was more likely something else in the product like a humectant or emollient), I've learned to take them with a grain of salt.\n\nI found [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799034/) but quick Googling isn't finding much else that isn't related to atopic dermatitis, though I'm on mobile so my Google skills are limited at the moment.\n\nEdit: Also, I know this is the AB sub but since OP brought up Eucerin, Eucerin has an **Roughness Relief Lotion** that is *possibly* 10% urea. The ingredients for the lotion are (or at least were last time I checked) identical to their UreaRepair PLUS 10% Urea Lotion. I asked Eucerin if they could confirm the percentage of the RRL, but they declined, saying they only disclose what they legally have to. **Udderly Smooth** also makes products with urea, including at 10% and 20%. At the moment I use the Eucerin Advanced Repair on my face daily, but use the Udderly Smooth Extra Care Cream (with 10%) in the cooler months. I use the Roughness Relief on my body (I have KP on my arms and legs, and urea's been *immensely* helpful for it), but found it *way* too greasy for my face. (Again, though, that's a personal review, so YMMV.)\n\n(Edit 2: Realized I need more coffee, got Eucerin's Intensive Repair, Advanced Repair, and Roughness Relief mixed up in my head. Fixed now.)",

I'm a bit skeptical given the almost industry-wide practice of not putting enough ceramides in OTC skincare products.  Also, without seeing the studies we really don't know what they're claiming the patented ceramide complexes do as far as barrier repair or how they actually performed (or if the testing was even valid/non-biased).",

Like, my whole back was closed comedones. \n\n\nSo I stopped all anti acne topical treatments and used the plain Cetaphil moisturizing cream emulsified with water every other day when I showered. \n\n\nThe comedones cleared up in a couple of weeks and the acne I'd literally had for almost a decade NEVER CAME BACK. \n\n\nLike, it's a year later and it still hasn't come back. I think Ive gotten one back pimple in the last year. I only wash with water and occasionally a very mild cleanser now if I've gotten actually dirty/sweaty. \n\n\nYMMV obviously.

The second is that I pledged never to pay for shipping. So I've either waited on products long enough that I have a few in my cart - this takes forever, because if I realize I've completely forgotten about an item, I take it out- or, if I really want it, I have to physically go to a store to buy it, which is a major activation barrier for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, basically, I have to trick myself - but my student income can't handle $100 products, and if cycling them into and out of the cart works for keeping me from buying them, then I'm game haha",

I've gotten CeraVe PM for $5 this way.\n* Using my HSA to pay for both Curology and sunscreen.  It saves you money because the money you put in there, you aren't paying taxes on it.  You can think of it as a roughly 20% discount on what you buy.  Your employer might contribute some money for you as well, so that's free money to spend on healthcare products like prescription skincare products.  Of course health insurance is confusing in the US, so you'll have to see if a HDHP + HSA is a good option for you.\n* Waiting for sales.  Paula's Choice pretty much always has 20% off if you wait / look for it.  I know Timeless and MUAC do occasional sales as well.  Know what you like and/or want to try, and stock up then.",

    "body": "My journey with closed comedones + acne as a PCOS girlie (without isotret)\n\n\nLong post ahead! 🫡\n\n\nI want to begin by saying that as someone who never struggled with intense acne growing up, it honestly crushed my self-esteem to be battling it today. Adult acne is a different kind of struggle. 🥹\n\n\nIt all started in 2024 when I grew white bumps on the side of my cheeks. Mid 2024 was basically a back and forth routine of me going to Skin Starion and getting Hyal-c facials to remedy it. \n\n\nA tortuous cycle of getting clear skin for 2 weeks post-facial, only for them to grow back again. Very unsustainable and saddening.\n\n\n*Dec 2024*\nI self-medicated, trying all the tiktok recos—from salicylic acid to eqqualberry swimming pool toner to skin 1004 products. \n\n\nBut I think the Cosrx salicylic acid ruined my skin and gave me really bad cystic acnes :( as I was applying it twice a day. \n\n\n*Jan 2025*\nI finally consulted with a derma online through the NowServing app. She was friendly! She put me on adapelene (klenzit cms) and benzoyl peroxide. Told me to trust the process, but these 3 months really made me doubt. \n\nI had visited with an OB and done some tests, which confirmed I had PCOS. But I wasn't open to taking BCP, so I didn't do anything to treat it. \n\n*March 2025*\nI still kept purging with the medication. I asked her if I could try Doxycycline (Tetralysal) to which she allowed. It stopped the cystic acne from growing, but it left me with really bad scars. At this time, I was continuing with Cetaphil as my cleanser, and Skin1004 hyalu-cica sunscreen. I used micellar water to double cleanse. \n\n\n*May 2025*\nI switched my derma as I wanted someone who could assess my skin in-person. Thankfully, it was HMO covered. She was really nice (hi Doc Giselle), and gave me lots of options. As I didn't want to resort to Isotret, she suggested we try facials + chemical peels nalang.  There were lots of comedones on my face that needed to be taken out kasi sobrang tagal na nila. \n\nShe said mas mahirap daw i-treat yung comedones kasi nasa ilalim siya, unlike the cystic acne na inflamed. \n\n\nWhat I liked about my new derma was that she allowed me to use my old skincare products, without judging me. So I switched back to my Human Nature Acne Facial Cleanser in the AM, and Cetaphil in PM. \n\n\nShe advised me to try Mineral Sunscreen, so I did. And it's one of the best decisions ever! Since I'm acne prone, I found that the mineral one didn't make my face oil up as much. So worth it naman yung Heliocare kahit 1,700 siya (almost 3x the price HUHU). She also put me on Azelaic acid + Vit C (both from her clinic). My moisturizer naman is the Numbuzin Panthenol Serum (contains niacinamide)\n\nNgl, I think I spent almost over 30k with the facials, medications, and skincare products combined. HAHA. But no regrets kasi I have a set routine na!\n\n*June 2025*\nMy skin improved so much! I can't afford Yellow Laser yet to remove the acne marks, so I just continue with my current routine. Hindi niya na ako pinapabalik sa clinic, unless for laser na. I'm really happy I got my closed comedones under control. Wala na ring bumps sa face. Acne marks nalang talaga. Sometimes I get occasional acne, and that's when I use my BP to treat it. \n\nI can now wear makeup without worrying about the bumps. I slowly regained my confidence. Looking back, it was one heck of a ride.\n\nThe last pic is my current routine for AM and PM. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading! 🤍 I hope I was able to inspire those battling comedones. So this is your sign to stop self-medicating and go to a derma! Mahirap kasi yung nag-eexperiment. Magastos lang talaga at first, huhu. \n\n\nIt gets better, I promise. We will see the light at the end! 🩷\n",

This is what I used back in college, but I stopped as I thought oil balms would make it worse. \n\nI find that it does the job better than micellar water, and my face feels cleaner after. I just cleanse twice with my Cetaphil to make sure there isn't any residue left.\n\n\nI also began drinking Spearmint tea as I read it could help with PCOS. Tbh, idk if it's scientifically-backed, but I felt like it made a difference with acne control lol. I alternate with Green Tea or Turmeric at night. Still irregular though.",

    "body": "My skin has improved so much since I started lurking skincare subs a couple months ago. I found out I was being abusive to my skin, punishing it while trying to fix it. Previous routine was microbead salicylic acid cleanser in the morning, tons of Stridex, then no moisturizer or sunscreen, then even more Stridex at night and maybe some benzoyl peroxide. Combined with compulsive picking and genetically large pores and you get a person who avoids all photographs and mirrors out of self loathing. I looked like a junkie with scabs all over my face. You might know what it's like to have your self-esteem decimated, to feel sorry for the people that have to look you in the eye. It probably looked worse to me than it actually was, but the effect was the same. It was bad as a teen and got even worse as an adult. \n\nMy skin is repairing, but it isn't perfect and never will be. I still get cysts, and I have scars that are well established. What's changed the most is the way I treat my skin. We're a team now. When I have a bad skin day, I don't pick and over-exfoliate. I just stick to the routine and remind myself that nobody has perfect skin, and you can be a good person no matter what face you present to the world. Now it's more \"good try, skin! Tomorrow you'll look better!\" Instead of \"I wish I could take a vegetable peeler to my own skull.\" That's a significant change. \n\nI'm grateful to the skincare community for all their great advice, but also for making me realize that my skin deserves my respect and care. Self abuse can take many forms, and sometimes it stems from feeling like you don't deserve any better. I hope that everyone on this sub, no matter what their skin looks like, can get some peace from the fact that they're doing their best. Your skin deserves to be treated well and so do you! ",

Did my skin show me once I hit 23!\n\nSince then I have been battling with the absolute worst type of acne you can get: PUSTULES. Plus, my skin started scarring SO BADLY along with it. I've tried it all: salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, tea tree oil, tretinoin, clindamycin, witchazel, DIM, Differin, Aczone, Spironolactone, blue light treatments, spearmint tea, turmeric/honey/lemon masks, countless dermatologist visits, you name it! Nothing worked!!\n\nI got psyched out last year as my skin seemed to FINALLY be giving me my reprieve. So I got a chemical peel and a microneedling treatment for my scars (1st 3 pics are right after those procedures.) But then this year arrives (recent, last 4 pics) and the cystic acne comes back with a vengeance! My face hurts constantly and I seriously want to walk into the ocean at this point. 😫 What. Does. My. Facial skin. Want from me!?? Send help plz!",

Asking because of the pattern of acne and seeing that one facial hair (I know we all get hairs here and there, but the combo of the two symptoms) makes me wonder about PCOS. Are you on birth control? Some birth control pills worsen acne because theyre androgenic. Also last resort is Accutane and I see you havent tried that. Given your pattern of acne it's odd that spiro didnt work. Maybe you didnt go on a high enough dose or did you get side effects? A topical + spiro and sometimes also a low androgenic birth control like Yaz or Yasmin (esp if spiro is giving you irregular periods) can help and like I said, Accutane as a last resort, but if your acne is hormonal it can come back even after a round of Accutane.",

It’s a serious commitment for about 6 months to a year of your life but I know someone who did it and it helped her tremendously. You should do some research on it and ask your doctor/derm for advice on whether it’s right for you.\n\nSecondly, my personal opinion is that most things that show up on our bodies physically are a result of what’s going on inside. I’ve learned that any type of physical reaction I’ve ever had was because I was lacking in something diet or nutritional wise. My advice to you would be to look at everything that you’re eating, not eating, supplements etc and either do some research on your own or see a naturopathic doctor. \n\nAlso don’t let people diagnose you on here.",

When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best.\n\n* The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.\n\n**Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!**\n\n*If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.

    "body": "\nskin type- oily, acne prone, mildly sensitive\nclimate- humid\nage- 20-25\nskin concerns- acne (mostly hormonal), oiliness, uneven texture, acne marks\n\ni made a similar post earlier but since then i’ve observed changes and hence, my opinions about some products have changed and i’ve even tried new products since then. skincare is an ever changing journey and we all learn along the way🥰\n\n⭐️Cleansers-\n\n1. Sebamed cleansing foam (Rs. 500-600 for 150ml)- super gentle, non-stripping, cleanses well, did not cause breakouts or inflammations, i use it when my skin is sensitive and inflammed. WRP 4.5/5❤️\n\n2. AcneStar facewash (Rs. 150 for 50g)- has AHA+BHA, thoroughly cleanses skin, did not cause inflammation, combats oiliness and acne (to an extent), exfoliating, has encapsulated beads with actives in it, can be stripping so i use it 3x a week. tip- leave on face for a minute before washing off. WRP 5/5❤️\n\n3. Minimalist salicylic acid cleanser (Rs. 299 for 100ml)- gentle, non stripping, can be used daily, non comedogenic for me. i alternate between this and acnestar facewash sometimes but i personally feel like acnestar and this cleanser do the same thing for me so i prefer acnestar over this for its exfoliating action. but if you have extremely sensitive skin, minimalist cleanser is a better option. WNRP 3.5/5💔\n\n4. Neutrogena deep clean gentle foaming cleanser (Rs. 345 for 100g)- my daily cleanser, works beautifully for my skin, cleanses skin really well without harsh reactions, never broke me out, can be used for double cleansing as well after using cleansing balm, removes oil and helps skin remain matte. HG 5/5❤️❤️\n\n5. The body shop tea tree cleanser (Rs. 745 for 50ml)- the reason its not present in the pictures is because i threw it away. it did absolutely nothing to my skin that any regular facewash cant do. it sometimes even made my skin sting. for its price, i found it to be a wasteful product. WNRP 1/5💔\n\nToners-\n\n1. The body shop tea tree toner (Rs.795 for 50ml)- makes my skin sting when applied but does mattify the skin, however i see no longterm differences in my skin even after using it regularly for 2-3 months. im sure much better toners are available in this price point. WNRP 2/5 💔\n\n2. Laneige cream skin toner (Rs.750 for 50ml)- beautifully moisturising and hydrating toner. can be a little greasy on the skin but its worth the hydration it provides. rather lightweight when compared to other hydrating toners. totally worth the money plus it goes on discount so many times. non comedogenic for me. WRP 4/5.❤️\n\n⭐️Serums-\n\n1. Minimalist salicylic acid 2% serum (Rs. 549 for 30ml)- love it. it has helped combat oiliness and acne to a great extent. i use it in the PM 5-6x a week. it gets absorbed really quick and it lightweight, doesnt sting or burn. WRP 5/5❤️\n\n2. Minimalist tranexemic acid 3% serum (Rs. 649 for 30ml)- its a decent serum but did nothing revolutionary for my skin. i used it for 2 months but could only see very slight difference in my skin. didnt break me out or cause inflaubut didn’t do much for my skin either. WNRP 3/5.💔\n\n3. Foxtale AHA BHA exfoliating serum (Rs. 545 for 30ml)- absolutely useless and horrible to my skin. broke me out the very next day and caused so many CCs. i stopped after using it twice, about to throw it out. HF 0/5🤮\n\n4. Chemists at play Acne control serum (Rs. 599 for 30ml)- i hate it it ruined my skin. it has azelaic acid and niacinamide and claims to help acne+scars but just ended up giving me more acne. its not in the picture because i threw it after just 3-4 days. i dont think i’ve hated any product more. isse ache kerosene ragad lo muhh pe. HF 0/5.🤮\n\n5. Lacto calamine salicylic acid serum (Rs. 499 for 30ml)- not shown in the picture. useless product. did absolutely nothing even though i finished off the whole bottle. didnt break me out or anything but didnt help with any concern either. WNRP 1/5.🤮\n\n⭐️Moisturisers/Creams-\n\n1. Lacto calamine green variant (Rs. 240 for 120ml)- i went back to this OG product when i wanted something lightweight for my inflamed skin. i used it during my teenage years it was amazing then it is amazing now. keeps my skin oil-free, calms my inflammation and the calamine in it actually helps w acne to a certain extent. ab absolute gem. WRP 5/5.❤️❤️\n\n2. Nykaa SkinRx spot corrector cream (Rs. 399 for 50g)- it has niacinamide, zinc, alpha arbutin and spf15. while i dont use this product as a sunscreen, it has pleasantly surprised me with its action. it genuinely helped lighten my acne marks amd has helped inducing even texture. it is a little heavy so i use only a little of it but i honestly dont mind my skin being a little oily given that it worked so well for me. nykaa really surprised me with this. WRP 4/5.❤️\n\n3. Neutrogena hydroboost water gel (Rs. 1050 for 50g)- i’ve been using this for almost a year now and i have absolutely no complaints. i will forever repurchase this product. i can even layer it 2-3 times for added hydration and it never feels heavy. absorbs like a dream. the action justifies its price point for me. HG 5/5.❤️❤️\n\n4. Re’equil ceramide and hyaluronic acid moisturiser (Rs. 395 for 100g)- heavy on the skin but was an absolute godsend when i messed up my skin barrier so bad that even touching my face meant pain and burning. saved my skin. non comedogenic for me. wouldn’t use it daily but i sometimes use it at night to boost my barrier. tip- use a pea-sized amount on damp skin for reducing greasiness. WRP 4.5/5.❤️\n\n5. Pilgrim squalene roll on under eye serum (Rs. 400 for 15ml)- it has a plant based retinoid and caffeine and genuinely helped with dark circles and puffiness. but i feel like it gave me tiny CCs around the eyes. WNRP 3.5/5💔\n\n6. GreenLeaf aloe vera gel (Rs. 130-150 for 120g)- even though it has added green colour, no other aloe vera gel has worked for me the way this one has. it has helped with calming my skin and controlling oiliness. i reach out for it whenever my skin feels inflamed or sensitive. HG 5/5.❤️❤️\n\n⭐️Sunscreens-\n\n1. The derma co. 1% hyaluronic sunscreen aqua gel spf50 PA++++ (Rs. 499 for 50g)- i love it. it blends like a dream into skin. im not sure about its protection but i havent tanned when i use it. its super lightweight, non comedogenic and doesnt have any irritating fragrance. WRP 4/5.❤️\n\n2. CosIQ serum sunscreen spf50 full spectrum (Rs. 699 for 30ml)- i have no idea what full spectrum means and im definitely not very convinced about their filters. it has a great feel to it, blends very easily, has a milky serum consistency, doesnt make skin greasy, no white cast but i wouldn’t wear it when its sunny outside. good for indoors or cloudy days. the price point is not justified at all. WNRP 2.5/5.💔\n\n3. Fixderma shadow gel spf50 PA+++(Rs. 525 for 75g)- blends quite easily, no white cast on my skin, can feel a little heavy but i prefer this when going out and its very sunny since im more sure about its protection. doesn’t make me tan, non comedogenic for me. WRP 4/5.❤️\n\n⭐️Miscellaneous products-\n\n1. Garnier micellar cleansing water (Rs. 375 for 400ml)- recently started using this and i have no complaints. doesnt strip my skin off and removes all makeup, sunscreen and impurities. WRP 4.5/5.❤️\n\n2. SoTrue Salicylic mask stick (Rs. 250-300 for 40g)- i love it’s packaging as its super easy to apply. i use it every 7-10 days and keep it for 10mins. it has helped controlling oiliness and breakouts. doesnt burn. however i dont feel like i’d buy it again since i already incorporate salicylic acid in my routine. WNRP 3/5.💔\n\n3. Multani mitti powder- my absolute holy grail. i use it 3x a week, mix it with rose water and keep it for about 10-15 minutes. it clears all oil, calms down acne and redness amd just makes my skin feel so good. its available at local retailers for about Rs. 100-150. HG 5/5❤️❤️\n\n4. The pink foundry drying lotion spot corrector (Rs. 500-550 for 15ml)- my go to product for acne breakouts. its gets rid of acne in 1-2 days maximum. smallers one dry out overnight. its a little pricey but definitely worth it for me. WRP 5/5.❤️\n\n5. Laneige lip sleeping mask (Rs. 600 for 8g)- i am forever buying this. i get the hype behind it and im here for it. makes my lips so soft and nourished. helped with chapped lips. a little amount goes a long way so i dont mind the price. absolutely love it. HG 5/5.❤️❤️\n\n6. Dabur gulabari rose water (Rs. 90 for 250ml)- i mainly use it for mixing multani mitti but sometimes i use it as a toner as well when i dont wish to use any active products. helps in calming the skin and has a cooling effect. love it. WRP 5/5.❤️\n\n7. Nykaa clay it cool oil control face mask (Rs. 599 for 100g)- not shown in the picture since i finished it but it wasn’t an exceptional product either. glorified multani mitti thats it. WNRP 2/5.💔\n\n8. The derma co salicylic acid face mask (Rs. 499 for 50g)- not shown in pictures since i got rid of it. completely stripped my skin and played a huge role in damaging my skin barrier. WNRP 1/5.💔\n\n9. MARS lip mask- not shown in the picture since i finished it. its a decent product. not exactly a dupe for laneige but it was an okayish product. works like an occlusive so its good for sealing products in. glorified vaseline with a better smell. i think this has been discontinued anyways. WNRP 3/5.❤️\n\n10. Pilgrim squalene exfoliating lip peel (Rs. 300 for 6ml)- not seen in picture since i finished it. gently exfoliating for lips, helps with pigmentation. leaves lip soft. not harsh at all. works slowly but gives results with consistent usage. WRP 4/5.❤️\n\n11. Benzac AC 2.5% gel (Rs. 105 for 30ml)- not shown in pictures. it has benzoyl peroxide and is a skin saviour for acne. it settles down acne overnight and i use it as spot treatment. its available from different manufacturers as well which retail for less such as Pernex AC 2.5%, etc. HG 5/5.❤️❤️\n\n12. Nykaa volcanic ash bubble sheet mask (Rs. 199 for 2 on B1G1)- not seen in pictures. cleansing face sheet, makes my skin feel good and clean. great for days when you feel like pampering your skin. no inflammation ror redness caused. WRP 5/5❤️\n\n\nthese are reviews of most of the products i’ve tried in the past year. and most of the products have been used for 1-2 months consistently before reviewing. some of the products aren’t seen in the photos since i’ve either thrown them out or have finished them off. these are my personal reviews and may differ since skincare is very subjective. hope these help and please feel free to comment your thoughts xx.",

        "body": "This is going to be long. It's a journey of 7-8 years and still ongoing... \n\nI have oily acne prone skin on my face, rest all of my body is dry. Fine straight hair with oily scalp. \n\nSo I had acne from the age of 14-15 around. This is when I started menstruating. Thought it's fine and that this is just puberty thing. Suffered like hell for 4 years. Severe acne I am taking about whole of face, back and chest and then stress from jee preparations really really messed up confidence , skin and hair. \n\nTried everything from ayurvedic, homoeopathic and allopathic medicines, dozens of products, did a lot of research about root causes - whether it's hormones, stress, dairy, pollution (I daily went under the sun for coachings) or PCOS. Came to know I don't have PCOS - no major weight gain or body hairs etc. Did a lot of DIY masks, this and that products, changing diet etc. \n\nDidn't went to Derm for initial years, thinking that it would heal on their own (my father also has acne so was it genes but his disappeared on its own in mid college). But after 4-5 years it really messed up my self confidence so I went to a Derm. She gave my some benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel, tretonin 0.025% cream and benzoyl peroxide facewash and sunscreen (idr correctly).\nUsed them for some months until 2nd year in college saw some positive effects for some months then didn't felt they will were helping so stopped. \n\nDid not do a lactose tolerance test coz I liked dairy and my coffee and didn't want to think that I had to leave everything. Though avoided milk and cheese for a long time. \n\nMy takeways -- \n1. Consistency is the key like really it is important.\n2. Pls use sunscreen ( I used many from minimalist to Neutrogena to lacto calamine. Recommendations are minimalist, dot & key, L'Sensa). \n3. Stress plays a huge huge role in your skin and hair health. To reduce stress go on walks, exercise, meditate. \n4. Exercise if you can bcoz it would really help. \n5. As mentioned above benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel works, I use it daily after facewash at night.\nFacewash > moisturizer > Benzoyl peroxide gel , leave it and sleep.\n6. Cover your face with dupatta or balaclava when outdoors even after applying suncreen. Sun would irritate and make your skin sensitive. \n7. Eat good. \n8. There are diff types of acne. Salicylic acid doesn't help everyone. It didn't helped me much only prevented some. But as periods came skin got fucked up again. \n\n\nI hope these help you pls feel free to reach out maybe I can help you in something 😃",

    "body": "**What are they?**\n--\n\n\"Actives\" are the common term for the group of power players in skincare with ingredients that have direct, active results on the skin, and have serious science backing it up.  These include acids like AHAs and BHAs, and antioxidants like Vitamin C and Vitamin A (retinol and tretinoin). \n\n\n**AHAs:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n-\nAlpha Hydroxy Acids (**AHA**) are **water-soluble** and dissolve the bonds of skin cells on the outer layers of the skin, sloughing off dead skin and the glue that holds them together. This is *not immediate*, it just speeds up the process. This helps brighten and plump skin so it is not uncommon to recommend them to users who want to **combat fine lines and signs of aging**, are looking to **reverse sun damage or hyperpigmentation**, or are seeking a **more even skin tone and texture** in general. All AHAs have humectant properties, making them particularly nice for dry skin types with continued use. They all also **increase photosensitivity**, meaning sunscreen is even more important while using an AHA! There are also sources that show that AHAs increase dermal thickness and improve collagen density as well as quality of elastic fibers. [1](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081) [2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x/abstract;jsessionid=8F1BD9BC1178A87ADF7E90B6EBD17F44.d02t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false) [3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false)\n\nMost Common Types:\n--\n\n* **Glycolic Acid:**  It has the smallest molecules in the group so can penetrate skin deeply and easily, making it the most effective for treating fine lines, acne, blackheads, dullness, oiliness etc. An all around good choice but for its efficacy might be harsh for some, especially in the beginning during purging. Because of it's harshness, it might be better for oily skin types or users who have already built up a tolerance to AHAs. Sensitive skintypes or users who are new to acids might want to be cautious.  Glycolic Acid is **derived from cane sugar.** \n\n* **Lactic Acid:** Milder than glycolic but has smaller molecules than mandelic, making lactic acid kind of just the middle man in this hierarchy. Still gentle enough where sensitive skintypes won't necessarily need as much caution. Good for all skin types. **Do not use if you have milk allergies.** \n\n* **Mandelic Acid:** Larger molecules than both glycolic and lactic, which means it takes longer to penetrate but is also the least irritating, which is beneficial during the purge period. Ideal for very sensitive skin types. This AHA is made from almonds, so **do not use if you have nut allergies.** \n\n**PHAs:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n--\n\nPoly Hydroxy Acids (**PHA**)  function essentially the same as AHAs, however are far less irritating due to larger molecular structures, which limits their ability to penetrate into the skin. **Studies currently show no increased photosensitivity**, and **have been found to be compatible with clinically sensitive skin, including those with rosacea and atopic dermatitis**. All PHAs provide **humectant *and* moisturization properties** and enhanced barrier function. Most contain **antioxidants that protect cell lipids and membranes from UV damage**. In a study directly comparing AHAs to PHAs, sallowness and pinch recoil were shown to have greater improvement with AHAs but stinging and degree of sensitivity were rated worse for the AHA regimen as well. This makes PHA a great alternative and the so-called \"next gen\" of AHA.  [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15002656) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14756648) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15002657)\n\nMost Common Types:\n--\n\n...I kind of feel like this is a misnomer because PHAs are overall not as common or as studied compared to BHAs and AHAs right now. Still, here's what I've found so far, I'll be adding more as I find more information on them:\n\n* **Lactobionic Acid:** Derived from lactose, is a humectant, antioxidant and soothing. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20367666) compared lactobionic acid to glycolic acid, although I feel like it probably should be more compared to Lactic Acid. \n\n* **Gluconic Acid:** Also known as gluconolactone, is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. According to [this](http://128.11.40.183/lasernews/rubin_lecture/21.html), a 6% decrease in dermal penetration compared to glycolic acid. \n\n\n\n**BHAs:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n--\n\nWhile AHAs certainly aid in fighting acne, Beta Hydroxy Acids (**BHA**) are **oil-soluble** and therefore penetrate deeper in the skin, thereby degunking pores and breaking comedones. This process helps to bring things to the surface thereby making it a common suggestion for those **fighting and preventing acne** and looking for a **clearer complexion.** BHAs have no humectant properties, and are actually quite drying, making them particularly recommended to oily-skin types. BHAs **do not increase photosensitivity** with use. [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21921960) [2](https://www.drugs.com/mmx/salicylic-acid.html)\n\nMost Common Types:\n--\n\n* **Salicylic Acid:** is really the most common BHA player in the game, and it isn't *actually* a BHA  :3  It just essentially functions as one. Salicylic acid is commonly made by acidifying sodium salicylate (which is the salt of the of the salicylate ion). You pop off the sodiums and put hydrogens on there, and voila, salicylic acid. Is in general suitable for all skin types but preferred by oily skin types.  **Do not use if you have an allergy to aspirin.**\n\n* **Betaine Salicylate:** Essentially the salicylate is cut with betaines to provide a far more mild BHA exfoliation. Betaines are useful for helping prevent dehydration of the skin as they are larger in molecule and have a milder keratolytic effect. Suitable for all skin types but might benefit dry/dehydrated skin that find salicylic acid too drying. **Still don't use if you have an allergy to aspirin? At the very least patch test.**\n\n**Vitamin C Serum:**\n--\n\nA comprehensive guide to vitamin c serums can be found by /u/MissPicklesMeow, [The More You Know: Vitamin C Serum FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/)\n\n**Retinoids:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n--\n\nRetinoids slough off dead skin cells the way AHAs do, while also being anti-inflammatory, making them great for fighting **acne, anti-aging, and hyper-pigmentation.** They also function as cell-communicators: **improving the way your skin sheds and causing new skin cells to divide and function at their best** - which helps prevent premature aging and stimulate collagen. They come with anti-oxidants, but also come with a fair amount of irritation, more than the previous categories. [1](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/464026_2) [2](http://www.skinacea.com/retinoids/what-are-retinoids.html)\n\nMost Common Types:\n\n\n * **Over-the-counter available:** From weakest to strongest: retinyl palmitate, retinol, and retinaldehyde are all available without prescriptions. Most products with retinyl palmitate are often too weak to provide any major skin benefits, especially in terms of anti-aging - Retinol takes two metabolic steps to be converted into retinoic acid, while retinyl palmitate takes three steps. \n\n * **Prescription strength retinoids:** From weakest to strongest: Adapalene, Tretinoin (or retinoic acid), Tazarotene, Isotretinoin. Aside from the type of retinoid, each individual product also has its own individual retinoid concentrations. Generally, you go with the strongest retinoid you can tolerate with the least amount of irritation, even if that retinoid is considered weak. \n\nA note: Retinoid creams do not replace or substitute moisturizers, though you can certainly cut them into the moisturizer to try and buffer irritation. \n\n---\n\n**Popular Products:**\n--\nCosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid\n\nNeulii Teatree BHA Blemish Control Serum\n\n CosRx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid\n\nMizon AHA 8% Peeling Serum\n\nMelano CC Spot Treatment\n\nOST C20 and C21.5\n\n*For a more comprehensive list on AHAs/BHAs, check out /u/the_acid_queen's [Asian Acids: an AHA/BHA Supercut](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3l78ir/asian_acids_an_ahabha_supercut/). For Western recommendations, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/exfoliation_recs) is a good starting point*\n\n---\n\n\n**Commonly Asked Questions:**\n--\n\n * ***How come there aren't that many AB options for these categories?***\n\nBasically, there just isn't (or wasn't) a market for it. The typical consumer is not interested in any product that would cause any irritation, even if they might ultimately prove beneficial to a routine. So the AB brands shy away from it since there just isn't much money to be made from it. CosRx and others do have an online base, and so their approach and market might be slightly different, but is by and large not a reflection on the overall trends in Asia currently, though we may see changes in this in the future. \n\n* ***Where in my routine should these products go?***\n\nThe [Product and Routine Order FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2tokdr/product_and_routine_order_faq/) on the sidebar has this covered in detail and in resources, however the one resource I link to the most from that page is /u/fanserviced's [Visual Guide to the Korean Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3jfug1/visual_guide_to_the_korean_skincare_routine/?sort=old) which is a nice quick cheat sheet to reference. You do *not* need every step included in a routine, it just shows every possible step and where it would be included. \n\n* ***How often should I use these products?***\n\n2-3 times a week is a good general frequency, seeing how your skin reacts and upping or lowering the frequency from there depending on concentration. With retinol products, depending on strength, you might want to only start with once a week. If the retinol burns, you can wash it off and try again the next night. \n\n* ***What about wait times?***\n\nWait times comes into the equation when you consider that these products are pH-dependent and work the best at specific pHs. This also dictates their product order. In following this thought process, you would have to wait 15-20  minutes after cleansing to let your skin return to its natural pH, and then 15 minutes after the application of any/every acid applied after to allow it the time to absorb and exfoliate entirely. \n\nThat said, this topic actually gets debated every now and then. You will find users who do not adhere to any wait times and see no difference, others find that waiting can enhance exfoliation and prefer to wait for pH levels optimal for exfoliating, and other users still who will tell you that wait times led them to over-exfoliation and was too much for their skin. Potentially, not *every* skin is going to need their actives working at its most effective range,  so the tl;dr is, YMMV. Start with no wait times, at least through the purge period. As you get used to a regular exfoliation schedule and learn how your skin reacts to it, try adding in a wait time in increments of 5 minutes, up to 20 minutes. See what your skin likes best. \n\n\n\n* ***What exactly are pH-adjusting toners and do I need one in my routine?***\n\npH adjusting toners lowers the pH of your skin after cleansing, readying it for pH-dependent actives. They typically have some acids in them, but at such low concentrations that they are not effective exfoliators. \n \nWe do have a [pH toner list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3e39ly/do_we_have_a_toner_ph_list_and_faq_and_if_not_can/) but I think it needs an updating - It's still quite a useful resource to find out if your toner is hydrating or pH adjusting. \n\nMy personal conclusions from everything I've read (and I'm not an expert disclaimer goes here):\n\n-Tap water does potentially increase the pH of the skin surface, even with a low pH cleanser. [1](http://www.sebamed.fr/client/document/effects-soap_94.pdf)\n\n-There is a correlation between low skin surface and enhanced functions of recovery. Low pH cleansers are more important to this than water pH. [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467032)\n\n-Starting around ages ~40+, the emphasis on needing to lower overall skin surface pH to maintain healthy barrier starts to become more important as it cannot recover as it once used to. [3](http://file.scirp.org/Html/2-1050013_7244.htm) [4](http://emjreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/Skin-pH-in-the-Elderly-and-Appropriate-Skin-Care.pdf)\n\n-Continued use of acids can lower the skin pH overall, but overdoing it will lead to irritation. Which is why some skintypes *can't* handle it working at its most effective range, because it's overkill. Making the rise of the skin surface pH from the tap water and/or eliminating wait times fully/partially actually a good thing, because it then makes it more balanced, gentle and less effective during the ages or the skintype wherein it's more preventative rather than reactive. \n\nSo, if you aren't reacting to your water (some people can), if you and/or your skin's age is not yet near 40, and especially if you are new to actives, I would actually suggest not even worrying about any of it yet.  Trying to go full blast when your skin doesn't need it yet is a common reason why a lot of people end up over exfoliating or experiencing irritation. As recommended above, start with no wait times until you get used to a regular schedule and see how your skin reacts to waiting. If you find you are waiting 20 minutes after cleansing, start looking at pH adjusting toners.   \n\n\n\n* ***How do I patch test actives?***\n\nWith consideration to there being a purge period, it's a bit pointless to patch test for irritation with these products. You still need to patch test for allergy or immediate adverse reaction, which takes a 24 hour test and should be applied to a small 1\" area of the face. Once that is done and cleared you can move forward with full face, taking careful note of how your skin reacts through the purge period. \n\n* ***Wait, what's purging and how do I tell the difference between breaking out?***\n\nWhen you use any exfoliating active - BHA, AHA, peels, or retinoids -  your skin will start to push out all the gunk from inside towards the surface. Which means if you have clogged pores, expect it to turn into whiteheads, if you have pimples, they might start looking worse. This process is called purging, can only happen with these actives (meaning **you cannot purge from a new basic moisturizer**), and details the process that **things get worse and then start getting better.** \n\nThe time frame for seeing improvement after purging should be 3-4 weeks, but it can - with stronger actives like retinoids - take even longer - But you should still start seeing improvements by that time. My suggestion is to **wait at least one month**, taking extra care to **listen to your skin** and look out for signs that it might not be purging:\n\n-If they get worse and stay worse, that is not purging. \n\n-If you start having *persistent* break outs in places that is not normal for you to break out, it is not purging (purging = short term, break out = long term).\n\n-If you experience tiny red bumps and itching, that is probably an allergic reaction and not purging. \n\n-If you stop using the product and your skin immediately calms down, then your skin was experiencing irritation rather than purging. If you stop use and your skin does not calm down but stays the same, then it was purging or a breakout. If your skin feels hot, prickly, or more sensitive than usual, than it is more than likely irritation or a sign that you are over-exfoliating. \n\n* ***What are the signs of over-exfoliating?***\n\n*Subtle to medium signs of over-exfoliating:* Shiny skin/forehead, increased oil production, puffiness, slight increase of sensitivity, breakouts of the small yet annoying scale, overall feeling of tightness/dryness/loss of moisture, blotchiness, patchiness, redness.\n\n*The your-skin-is-screaming-at-you-to-stop signs:* Burning, itching, feeling of heat, extreme sensitivity, cystic eruptions. Your face will be angry, it's kind of hard to miss. \n\nYou could show subtle to medium signs for a while and not realize it if you aren't in tune to your skin. Some people react in like a day, and that sucks but at least it's easy - others it can get bad only after a couple weeks to up to a month.\n\n\n* ***I over-exfoliated :( How do I repair my barrier and how long will it take?***\n\nWell, the first thing is to cut out all exfoliators until your skin bounces back. Then, go bland with the rest of your routine. Make sure you're washing your face with a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser and prioritize hydrating and moisturizing your face until your skin can repair itself. Ceramides, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, zinc oxide, aloe, snail are among the ingredients that will help the most during this period, so having them in your arsenal helps even before you start using actives. As far as how long it will take, be patient, it can take up to a month or more for your barrier to repair itself. \n \n\n* ***Are there any bad combinations or ingredients that shouldn't go together?***\n\n-Copper peptides and vitamin C can cancel each other out \n[1](http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/content/94/4/1259.short) but other sources say it's likely a myth and needs further study. \n\n-Niacinamide can cause flushing in some people when introduced to acidic pHs, particularly L-AA vitamin c serums, but not everybody is sensitive to this. If you find you are sensitive, a 20 minute wait time between products should be enough to combat this. Have two opposing sources on this topic:  [1](http://kindofstephen.com/can-you-use-niacinamide-and-vitamin-c-ascorbic/) [2](https://www.futurederm.com/should-niacinamide-and-l-ascorbic-acid-be-used-together/)\n\n-Retinoids and waxing do not go together. Even at low strengths, you can irritate and/or lift skin when waxing while having a retinoid in your routine. Your esthetician should ask you beforehand. \n\n-Benzoyl peroxide can render topical tretinoin ineffective, but the combo is okay when formulated properly to be together [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958193/)\n\n-Seriously, make sure you're wearing sunscreen if you are using AHAs or retinoids. I mean, you should be diligent about sunscreen anyways, but seriously guis. You'll do more damage than good if you begin use of these products and do not use sunscreen. \n\n-When starting multiple actives, it's mostly just common sense that dictates to ease in very slowly. Retinol especially, you might want to cut out all actives for a while and re-introduce them later once you've built some tolerance. It isn't so much that it's bad to have it in one routine, it's just way easier to experience over-exfoliation and irritation. You want to avoid that by practicing caution and going slow. \n\n\n* ***Do PoC and/or darker skin tones benefit from a certain types more than others?***\n\nI've found hearsay about how darker skin tones tend to prefer glycolic acid over others, and I've found hearsay that has said that PoC tend to experience more irritation than others when using acids to the point where glycolic is even discouraged. So. I wanted to address all of these notes specifically with some extra research, and have found the following:\n\nThere *is* [a larger risk of PIH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921758/pdf/jcad_3_7_20.pdf) in regards to use of acids in any large percentage, ie, chemical peels. \n\n\nAs far as overall irritation and risk, here is a study on the [effect on Asian skin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9107290), one targeting the [effect on darker skin tones of Indians with melasma](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12269877), and one [comparing glycolic to mandelic](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-4725.2008.34383.x/full) - In this the combination of mandelic *and* salicylic proved more effective but took longer to showcase than simply using glycolic. All of these studies say yay. good to go on using acids. I also found [salicylic was safe and improved acne and hyperpigmentation in darker racial ethnic groups](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9935087). So, aside from the risk of PIH cited from the first study, no further risk for irritations should be expected compared to other groups, nor is one acid shown to be more favorable than another? At least not from what I've found?\n\nIn [Management of hyperpigmentation in darker racial ethnic groups](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19608057) ([full text here](http://www.obgynnews.com/fileadmin/content_pdf/san/scms_pdf/Vol28_i2_Hyperpigmentation.pdf)) it's concluded that \"Given the propensity of darker skin to hyperpigment, peeling agents and resurfacing procedures should be used with care and caution. Maximal results are best achieved with repetitive, superficial, resurfacing modalities.\" \n\nSo with all that, I would say it's not a matter of one acid being better than another for darker skin tones, or that they experience more irritation. They do however have to **take special care and caution for melasma and hyperpigmentation, and in that it's moreso the method than the acid- Lower percentages for long term maintenance are more ideal than higher percentages for short term resurfacing and peels.** If anyone has further research, insights, or thoughts on this subject I'd love to hear about it! \n\n---\n\n**Potentially Interesting Discussions:**\n--\n\n[Support group for over-exfoliators](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tac9m/can_we_have_a_support_group_for_overexfoliators/)\n\n[Keratosis pilaris and body exfoliation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3quyvs/keratosis_pilaris_korean_spasscrubs_and_a_body/) and [Let's talk about body exfoliation!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4d42w1/lets_talk_about_body_exfoliation/)\n\n[AB versus Western](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/31iuia/has_anyone_found_an_ab_ahabha_better_than_the/)\n\n[A Note on Acids and UV photosensitivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4rq809/a_note_on_acids_and_uv_photosensitivity/)\n\n[How do Asians exfoliate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2brprj/how_do_asians_exfoliate/)\n\n[How often/which actives do you use?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4hw5br/how_oftenwhich_actives_do_you_use_how_long_did_it/)\n\n[Your thoughts on physical exfoliation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3gbs7q/your_thoughts_on_physical_exfoliation/)\n\n[Stacking too many products cause clashing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2vq3ex/can_ingredients_clash_when_stacking_so_many/)\n\n[Using actives - What's your story?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4chp7w/using_actives_whats_your_story/)\n\n[Which actives worked best for you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/400tkx/actives_vitamin_c_aha_bha_which_active_works_best/)\n\n[Washing off chemical exfoliators?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/48aahj/if_bhaahas_are_chemical_exfoliates_do_you_wash_it/)\n\n[AB Retinol Products?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/39by5n/retinol_products/)\n\n[For those who went through over-exfoliation, did it slowly start showing signs, or did you suddenly wake up with over exfoliated skin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3vgdmi/for_those_who_went_through_overexfoliation_did_it/)\n\n\n-[For those of you that have tried no/minimal wait times between multiple acids, what was your experience?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3z895r/for_those_of_you_that_have_tried_nominimal_wait/)\n\n-[ELI5/questions on toners, wait times, pH, etc](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/32mq81/eli5questions_on_toners_wait_times_ph_etc/)\n\n-[Skin pH and Urban Legends: An Argument Against Wait Times and pH-Adjusting Toners](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3vfa7s/blog_post_skin_ph_and_urban_legends_an_argument/) \n\n---\n\nFeel free to submit links for any of the above parts, discuss actives in your routine, submit a question for the FAQs or a discussion link for the PID sections.

I've acquired the following within the last month or so: Cosrx Natural BHA Skin Returning A-Sol Toner, Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, and the Cosrx One Step Pimple Clear Pads.  \n\nI've been using the A-Sol and Power Liquid on Sunday and Thursday, with the Power Liquid going on my T-zone and the A-Sol treating the rest of my face. The pads I've been using on Tuesday and Saturday.  \n\nAm I playing with fire, or am I just essentially using similar enough products that I should narrow it down to the one my skin responds to best?  I've tried poking around a few times to see if I could find routines that used these products in conjuction and didn't turn up much.  \n\nI openly admit this is an area I'm not familiar with, so I've been trying to do my reading but the differing opinions out there are getting confusing. Taking a shot that maybe someone here can help, even if it's a slap upside my head.\n\nMy skintype is combination that trends towards oily, and is sensitive.

    "body": "So you’re interested in Asian skincare, but you don’t know where to begin.\n\n##The Philosophy \n\nThere is a lot of buzz around the concept of Asian skincare, and a lot of confusion. Most articles about it focus on the high number of possible steps that an Asian skincare routine can contain, which can be overwhelming for newcomers. \n\nThe Western skincare routine is comparatively simple. It boils down to cleanser and moisturizer. Some people use eye cream and some have a spot treatment. Serums are usually a splurge. Taken individually, each of these products can be great. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to solve all of your skin problems with just one cream and nearly impossible to develop and manufacture a cream to suit every possible combination of skin problems. What if you're struggling with acne and aging? What if you're aging but oily? What if you want to fade dark marks while hydrating very dry skin? Good luck finding a single product that tackles all of these problems while still being at a formulation that works for your skin. Some active ingredients need to be within a specific pH range to work. Others simply don't play well with each other.\n\nThis is where the Asian skincare routine comes in. You know all those toners and essences and serums and ampoules and emulsions you keep hearing about? They act as a vehicle of delivery for different active ingredients to target different issues or to reinforce the treatment of issues. You might have a toner or essence that brightens, with a serum that targets aging, and an emulsion and cream that address redness. The possibilities are endless. That's what makes Asian skincare so effective for so many of us!\n***\n##The Basic Steps\nWhen complete, your Asian skincare routine will be in this order, though you may not necessarily have every step:\n\n* Emulsifying oil cleanser\n* Foaming, milk, gel, powder, or soaping cleanser\n* Chemical exfoliator(s) and/or toner\n* Essence, serums and ampoules\n* Emulsion\n* Lotion\n* Cream\n* Facial oils\n* Sunscreen\n\n***\n##How to build an Asian skincare routine\nWhen it comes to building an Asian skincare routine, there are many different approaches you can take. You can wait until you run out of one of your current Western products, then look for an Asian replacement. The other, which I advocate, is to prioritize your product replacements based on two things: importance and rarity. First look for products that are important to skin health and for which it is difficult to find high quality equivalents in the mainstream Western market. The products below are arranged in that order. And while you're building your daily routine, try out some sheet masks! The instant gratification they offer can't be beat. This is why sheet masks are known as the Gateway Drug to Asian Skincare™.\n\n**Note: To prevent irritation and breakouts, remember to patch test every new product and give yourself 2 weeks to 1 month in between introducing each new product; otherwise you won’t know which product had which effect - positive or negative!**\n\n##Sunscreen\nWhen it comes to protecting  your skin from dark spots, signs of aging, and cancer, sunscreen is the most vital component of your routine. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Western drugstore sunscreens are unpleasant to use, especially at the ¼ Tsp dose that's recommended for full coverage. They tend to be heavy and greasy, with a strong white cast. The Asian market offers a huge selection of affordable, cosmetically elegant sunscreens with high UVA and UVB protection. Start here. For effective protection, look for a sunscreen with high SPF and PA Ratings: at least SPF 30 and PA+++ or higher.\n##Cleansing oil/makeup remover\nNow that you have a good sunscreen, you'll need an effective way to remove it at night, as well as to remove any other makeup you wear. The [double cleanse](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2014/08/skincare-discovery-cleansing-part-i.html) is an integral part of many people's Asian skincare routine. The oil cleansing step breaks up and lifts off sunscreen and makeup so that your foaming cleanser can wash it away and get your skin nice and clean.\n##Essences, serums, and ampoules\nNow it's time for the really fun stuff! Essences, serums, and ampoules will be the primary vehicles for your skincare actives--the ingredients with specific, measurable effects against specific skin troubles--and thus the primary method by which you can customize your skincare routine. They are also where you can really start playing around with interesting ingredients that you won't find at the drugstore.\n\nEssences are usually a watery liquid. Serums and ampoules are thicker and contain more concentrated active ingredients. All types generally deliver some light hydration but are meant to sink in to the skin underneath moisturizing products.\n\n**Here are some popular ingredients and their functions:**\n\n* Vitamin C: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, repairs sun damage, increases collagen production over time.\n* Niacinimide: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, strengthens skin's moisture barrier\n* Snail secretion filtrate/snail mucin/snail goo: Alleviates redness, treats pimples, speeds healing, repairs sun damage, evens skin tone. [Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23652894)\n* Arbutin: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots by blocking the expression of melanin with long term use.\n* Yeast ferment extract/galactomyces/saccharomyces: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, evens skin tone, controls cell turnover and oiliness\n* Hyaluronic acid/Sodium hyaluronate: Hydrates by attracting and binding water within the skin\n* Glycerin: Hydrates by attracting and binding water within the skin\n* Salicylic acid: Chemical exfoliant (BHA) for the clearing of pores and treatment of acne; anti-inflammatory. Requires a pH between 3 and 4 to be effective.\n* Glycolic acid: (a type of AHA) Chemical exfoliant for the smoothing of skin's surface and treatment of acne; hydrating. Requires a pH between 3 and 4 to be effective.\n* Hydroquinone: Lightens dark spots. A controversial ingredient, hydroquinone--commonly associated with “skin bleaching” products--is rarely offered in over-the-counter products, except in extremely low concentrations, and you won’t encounter it much in popular Asian skincare lines. Hydroquinone works by inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase by acting as melanocyte cytotoxic inhibitor and by increasing the cytotoxicity of melanocytes.  Arbutin is a gentler and much more common cousin of hydroquinone. \n* Kojic Acid: Also lightens dark spots. Kojic acid lightens the skin by suppressing tyrosiase activity and is commonly used in topical formulations to treat dark spots. Kojic acid has a higher efficacy than arbutin in lightening the skin. (source: Skin Lightening and Depigmenting Agents : Article by Alaina James) \n* Mandelic acid (a type of AHA), a popular option for those who react poorly to the more common AHA options.\n* Starfish extract: Could starfish be the new snail? The preliminary research is promising, showing starfish’s anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, whitening, and wound healing potential. [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2ilph5/move_over_snails_2014_is_the_year_of_the_starfish/) \n\nDon't feel constrained to use only one of each product type at a time. If you have multiple issues to treat, using multiple essences, serums, or ampoules is absolutely acceptable. Just remember to use any pH-dependent products first, and wait around 20-30 minutes before adding more products on top. And don't feel required to use all of these product types if you don't want to. An Asian skincare routine is only as elaborate as you want it to be!\n##Moisturizers\nThe Asian skincare routine offers several options for moisturization  and hydration. Emulsions are thin, liquid lotions that generally provide light hydration. They may be all that an oily skin type needs, while dry skin types often find them useful to add an extra boost under a heavier cream. Creams are thicker and generally more moisturizing. Sleeping packs and sleeping masks are heavier still and serve as the occlusive last step in a normal or dry skin type's nighttime routine. Facial oils can also be used as an occlusive last step, which is particularly helpful for very dry skin, and can also be blended with creams. As with essences, serums, and ampoules, all of these moisturizing options can include different actives to care for different skin problems. Also like essences, serums, and ampoules, you don’t need to use them all if you don't want or need to!\n##Toners\nIt can be difficult to find a Western equivalent to the Asian toner. In Western markets, toners are often astringent and meant to dry up oily skin types, which is usually a no-no in the nurturing Asian skincare philosophy. In contrast, Asian toners are typically hydrating, exist to remove residue, or lower the pH of skin after an alkaline cleanser so that it is more balanced and is ready for acids if you use them, and in general “arrange” the skin after cleansing so that it is ready to receive the optimal benefits from the products that follow. Some contain actives, while others focus on hydration by providing ingredients like hyaluronic acid. Look for one at a pH of 5.5 or below.\n##Other products: Foaming cleansers and chemical exfoliants\nWhen putting together an Asian beauty routine, I generally find it most practical to deal with products like foaming cleansers and chemical exfoliants last. This is because there are perfectly acceptable options for these available in the Western market. For cleansers, look for a [pH](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2014/09/skincare-discovery-why-ph-of-your.html) around 4 to 5.5.  Our [cleanser pH spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-NtG1u1bp9h83YC2XDfa8Q-XgLB_b_kPi8c9sQW50co/edit#gid=0) can be a good starting point. For chemical exfoliants, look for a pH between 3 and 4. Some other products also have specific pH ranges where they work best, such as Vitamin C, which you can read about in more depth [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/).\nAnd that's about it! If you so choose, there are also a number of clay masks, face scrubs, and other special-occasion options to add in to your routine for an extra oomph.\n##A note on samples\nEveryone's skin is different, making building an Asian skincare routine a process of trial and error. You might think this makes the endeavor prohibitively expensive—and it would be, if you had to purchase full sizes of every product you want to test. Luckily, Korean skincare companies make samples very accessible. Online vendors like TesterKorea and RoseRoseShop sell sample sets and packs of sample sachets for a few dollars each and are often generous with samples when you make purchases. In addition, some people, like me, have built up large collections of samples over time and might just be willing to share them, if you ask nicely.\n***\n##Beginner FAQs\n\n**There are too many steps!  Do I have to start with a full routine to see benefits?**\n\nNo, as I mentioned above in **How to build an Asian skincare routine**, you can start slowly by replacing your western products with Asian ones as you empty them, although sunscreen (especially if you don’t have one or don’t like the one you have) is always a good starting point.\n\n**Snails and starfish?  Hell no, I’m noping right outta here.**\n\nThey’re popular for a reason, but there are many, many popular Asian products that have no \"unusual\" ingredients that you can’t also find in western products, although the Asian formulations are often better and at a lower price point.\n\n**I tried one of the cult products and it broke me out!**\n\nSadly, not everything works the same on everyone.  Many things you just need to explore for yourself, which is why patch testing and staggered introduction of new things is so important.  You can also look at the ingredients on [cosdna](http://cosdna.com/) to start narrowing down what ingredients don’t work for you, so you can avoid them in the future.\n\n**Ok I’m sold, I’m ready to buy X product on amazon/ebay.**  \n\nBeware of fakes.  You can review the Giant List of Sellers from the sidebar link [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/290to0/giant_list_of_websites_ebayers_etc/) for trusted sellers.\n\n**I keep seeing \"whitening\" everywhere- I don’t wanna bleach my face!**\n\nRest assured, whitening **usually** refers to \"brightening\" by fading areas darkened by damage.  It will not change your natural skin tone.\n\n**Show me the science!  Studies  and sources for everything,  or GTFO.**\n\nOne of the great things about the skincare market in Asia is that the consumers are highly discerning, have almost zero brand loyalty, and are always looking for “the next best thing.”  This creates a demand for fast and progressive Research & Development, so companies can release new products and woo customers away from other brands.  This means there’s always something new and exciting being researched, but peer-reviewed studies are a slow and methodical process.  Also, companies want to protect their intellectual property so data is not always immediately released.  There are preliminary studies out there such those linked earlier for snail mucin and starfish extract, which is exciting, but you’re not going to get the same “established proof over 20 years of study” like you are with western ingredients.  That’s part of the fun!\n\n**How do I choose  products?**\n\nWe can only give you pointers. Ultimately, the person who needs to do the research is you.  Figuring out your skin type and what concerns you have you want your routine to help with is a good first step.  You can get an indicator user flair [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2hb3k9/new_feature_update_indicator_flairs_now_available/) which will tell people what your skin type and troubles are, so they can make informed recommendations.  We also have many product resources on the sidebar, so you can look through them for people who have the same skin type and troubles as you.  Researching what works and doesn’t work for your “skin twins” is a great place to start!  \n\nIf you have already looked through the sidebar recommendations and you’re still lost, go ahead and ask your question in the ASK HERE! Daily Help and Questions thread located at the very top of the [/r/AsianBeauty front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/). Make sure to read the posting guidelines at the top of the thread before you post so you can include the kind of information we need to help you better!\n\n**Edit 7/27/16: What should I buy in my first haul???** We've talked a lot in this post about the different types of products to choose from, what they do, and things to take in mind as you begin to put together an AB skincare routine of your own. But it's also important to consider *how* you put together that AB skincare routine! Generally, picking and buying everything in one giant haul is a recipe for disaster, especially if you're fairly new to skincare. It takes time to learn your skin's sensitivities and preferences. For pointers on why your first haul should be a small one, and advice on which products that first haul should contain, please check out [this amazing post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4gltx6/newbies_why_your_first_haul_should_only_have_four/) of first haul tips!\n\nEnjoy your Asian skincare journey!",

That took care of deep cystic acne, but I still suffered from surface level bumps. Last summer I tried a Salicylic Acid lotion from CeraVe but it really screwed things up even further and I ended up with itchy bumps everywhere that would just not go away.\n\nAfter struggling for 6 months to get it under control, I did a lot of research and reading on here and decided to treat it like fungal acne/ folliculitis and focus on my moisture barrier, and it has disappeared. My AM and PM routine is wash face with Happy Cappy baby shampoo (anti fungal), then wash again with CeraVe Renewing SA cleanser. I immediately coat my face with CeraVe moisturizing lotion in the tub, wait 20-30 minutes and moisturize again. Every other night I use diffrin between the moisturizing steps. I also just got the BePlain Clean Ocean Sunscreen today and plan to start it tomorrow morning as my last step.\n\nIt took about a month to repair my moisture barrier. I tried using La Roche Posay Cicaplast baum and The Ordinary Squalane oil for maintaining hydration, but both just felt extremely heavy caused additional itchy bumps. But despite some bumps in the road, I am so happy to finally love my skin and this sub had so much to do with it. Thank you all!",

I have a tendency to give up quickly. I have a question for you if you have a moment-your face wash, I'm surprised you are doing salicylic acid. It does not burn or make you too sensitive based on Tazarotene? I have been using a gentle face wash since I started which I can't stand because I love something stronger to get rid of skin cells. I have La Roche-Posay Effaclar Medicated Gel Cleanser 2% Salicylic Acid Cleanser + LHA + Glycerin which I absolutely love but stopped using. Maybe I can start up again. It's only been four days but truthfully I see the difference. My pores are shrinking, very fast. And I haven't developed more bumps, which I often got. My skin looks slightly like yours used to although it's more focused and pronounced around my mouth. Thank you for posting your story and your journey. I appreciate you.",

    "body": "I've gotten 2 sessions so far, the first at 1.5 mm and then at 2.0 mm, 1 month apart. I have very minimal adverse reactions, asides from the typical expected ones expected during the first 3 or 4 days after each microneedling session, so I thought I would share what's working for me.\n\nMy esthetician unfortunately was not super verbose with the instruction, but I put this together from different dermatologist websites and YouTube videos, and verified it with her.\n\nOther notes: I have acne prone skin that gets triggered by junk food, heavy salt, and my hormonal cycle. I purposefully chose to have the micro needling session at the start of my follicular phase, where my skin is just healing from the breakouts triggered during my period. My skin is usually most resilient during my ovulatory phase, but that's also when I have the most energy and don't want to be a home goblin during the recovery period and no exercising.\n\n# Pre-Care\n\n* Stop acid peel 2 weeks before\n* Stop tretinoin 1 week before\n* Stop salicylic acid/benzoyl peroxide/actives the day before\n* Wash face before coming in\n* Prepare clean towels, blanket, pillow cases\n* Wash makeup brushes\n* Avoid fish oil, NSAIDS or aspirin or anything that might thin your blood and cause more bleeding (contribution from u/Secure-Common-7169)\n\n# Post-Care\n\n* No anti-inflammatory meds for 1 week\n* No excessive sun exposure for 2 weeks; wear hat if outside, but also limit exposure\n* Drink collagen and/or bone broth to optimize healing.\n* Avoid showering until 24 hours after microneedling to allow microchannels to heal without introducing infection\n* Day 1 - 3:\n   * Treat skin gently washing with a gentle cleanser, cool water, using hands only and pat dry no earlier than 4 hours after treatment.\n   * If there are a lot of whiteheads, that’s normal. Don’t pick or treat with anything, they will go away within a day.\n   * Avoid strenuous exercises that cause sweating, jacuzzi, sauna or steam baths for 24 hours due to open pores, or up to 48 hours if inflammation exists.\n   * Sleep on your back with head of bed elevated to minimize swelling or pain as needed\n* Day 2 - 7:\n   * Peeling may start 3-5 days after treatment. You will notice skin dryness and flaking. This is due to an increased turnover of skin cells. Do not pick, scratch or scrub at treated skin! Allow old skin to flake off naturally and keep moisturized AT ALL TIMES with Hyaluronic serum\n   * By day 3-5: increase hydration skincare\n* Day 1 - 5 skincare routine:\n   * AM: splash water, HA, SPF\n   * PM: gentle cleanser, HA, moisturizer\n* Hyaluronic acid is okay the day after\n* Can restart regular skincare treatment after Day 7\n* No chemical peel until after Day 14\n* Wear SPF daily, every 3 hours on first 3 days\n* Use mineral sunscreen the first few days\n* Moisturizing sheet masks with no actives are okay\n* Avoid actives the first week (Vit C, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, etc.)\n* No exercising until day 5 (or until face is less red)\n\n# Healing Progression\n\n* Day 0 (right after): face is red, feels tight\n* Day 1: face is still red, no pain. A lot of little whiteheads pop up by night time. These are tiny and not inflamed.\n* Day 2: face is still a bit red, no pain, some itching in certain places that can be relieved by light tapping. More whiteheads than yesterday, some are bigger but still not inflamed.\n* Day 3: face is slightly flushed, not super noticeable. Whiteheads all gone. Skin looks pretty normal, but there are a few dry patches visible with foundation on.\n* Day 4: face is slightly splotchy with redness. Can cover with makeup.\n* By day 7: skin is back to normal\n\nBelow are progress pics:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xn9yo4x35zsc1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=797e75065900a4c30beb492f95b689e66f64ec84\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e1am9x35zsc1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=407fb9f2d0211aa7b6a6808f5dfd2442abd22615\n\nRant:\n\nI really dislike how microneedling is marketed as a noninvasive procedure, by both dermatologists and estheticians. Yes, it's less invasive than surgery or laser, but you're still puncturing millions of tiny holes into your skin. You essentially have an active wound site all over your face for the first 24 hrs, and the next few days is your skin trying to heal from that. It might be scary, especially if you have amazing skin before and not used to seeing it red, splotchy, and \"beaten up\" during the healing process.\n\nThe pre and post-op care needs to be more standard and better presented to everyone, as well as what to expect as your skin heals. When people say they get this done on a whim and then freak out when the redness is too much to go out in public, that's a failure on the part of the microneedling provider to give proper instruction on what to do and what to expect.\n\nAnyways, stepping off my soapbox. Hopefully this is helpful to those looking to try microneedling in the future!",

I also take Humira for RA and was told it was perfectly fine, no problem. Now reading these posts and Dr. Google makes me think Well, how is that possible if the microneedling is causing an inflammatory response and Humira works to calm/prevent inflammation??? Ugh, I am so scared I have really permanently damaged my skin. I ordered IS Pro Heal, which I used after IPL, do you think it will help the texture problem now??

    "body": "I wanted to share my experience with Belo Medical Group, to help others who may want to consider their services. 5 months ago, I visited Belo to address my acne concern. I have moderate acne and oily skin. I was prescribed with the ff. skin care routine.\n\n**AM:**\n\nGlycolic Soap 5%\n\nZO Salicylic Acid Oil Control Pads\n\nAcne Astringent\n\nInno-Derma Oil Defense Sunscreen\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PM**:\n\nGlycolic Soap 5%\n\nZO Salicylic Acid Oil Control Pads\n\nAcne Astringent\n\nAlternating Tretinoin 0.05% and Acne Drying Cream\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the procedures: it’s the regular Glycopeel Cleaning and Spanish Peel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, the results didn’t go well. My skin worsened, I have more active pimples leaving more pimple marks, skin became more oily and the skin tone in my face became darker that doesn’t match my neck!\n\nDespite my concerns, their dermatologist claimed that my skin improved, which obviously, I found hard to believe. They offered me an expensive procedure to address the pimple marks. I’m really disappointed because, their offering me another treatment to address a skin problem that they themselves have caused.\n\nThanks to this Reddit Community, that I discovered that Belo’s approach contradicted the recommendations of other dermatologists. For instance, Belo doesn’t allow to use moisturizers and introducing too many active ingredients alongside with the tretinoin at the beginning of the treatment; intead of starting slowly. I’m also alarmed to learn that they're not board-certified dermatologists.\n\nActing to the suggestions from this community, I consulted a board-certified dermatologist in SLMC and this is the best decision I’ve made. The new routine is very simple and cost effective; on top of that the products are available in the pharmacies. Three weeks have passed, and I can already see significant improvements. The pimple marks caused by Belo’s treatment already lightens and my skin tone is back to normal. I can already see significant improvement in my oily skin. My acne is not yet clear and I’m still getting few pimples, but I believe this is part of the purging phase since I was prescribed with a new type of retinoid (i.e., Oral Isotretinoin). I’m not bothered since the pimples heal fast in just a few days; and I'm under the guidance of a board-certified dermatologist. Hopefully, my skin concern will be completely address after few months of sticking with my new routine.\n\nExpensive skin care doesn’t guarantee effectiveness. Be wary of celebrities who endorsed these beauty clinics since most likely these are paid promotions. Always consult a board-certified dermatologist for reliable advice and cost-effective treatment.\n\nHope this helps!",

I'll be keeping my review of each item fairly short. I also want to mention that some of these products are either discontinued or have been reformulated, which I will note. If I can find the ingredient list for these products I will also be linking them as well.\n\nTo give some context about me and my skin type, I'm mid to late 20 year old male, my skin type is combination (oily T-Zone, dry to normal U-Zone) and I suffer from cystic acne ever since I was a teenager. I live in a climate where it's fairly dry all year round with harsh winters; gets down to around -20C which is -4F, and in the summer it sometimes can get fairly hot around 30C which is 86F.\n\nMy main concerns for my skin is acne and the hyperpigmentation it leaves behind.\n\n**Cleansers:**\n\n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-pyunkang-yul-acne-facial-cleanser) \\- this was just an ok cleanser, nothing to rave about but nothing to boo at. I don't think it'll necessary clear much acne, even if you have common acne. It does create a slight lather. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance free. \n* [*Etude House Real Art Moisture Cleansing Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-real-art-cleansing-oil) \\- was not really a fan of this cleansing oil, I don't really wear makeup so I can't really say how well it cleansed, but the fact that it has fragrance kinda peeves me off. Alcohol free, has been renewed once. \n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing 5.5 Cleansing Foam*](https://incidecoder.com/products/papa-recipe-eggplant-clearing-5-5-cleansing-foam) \\- this is a basic foam cleanser, I don't really think it really helps with acne. Lathers pretty well, and with these foam cleansers, you only need a small amount to cleanse your face so it lasts a long time. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*2ndesign First Cleansing Oil Pure & Fresh*](https://incidecoder.com/products/2ndesign-first-cleansing-oil-pure-fresh) \\- didn't mind this oil cleanser, minimal ingredients, has a tolerable scent for a wash off product and it's quite affordable. Emulsifies well, and doesn't leave a weird film on the skin. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*Cosrx Low pH good Morning Gel Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-low-ph-good-morning-gel-cleanser) \\- i probably have emptied more than one tube of this, but obviously, who can say they've delved into AB without trying a Cosrx product before. I think this is fine because I have somewhat oily skin, but from what I've read general consensus is that it's not great for dry skin. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-hydrating-cleanser-2) \\- for me this cleanser is probably one of the best cleansers on the market. The fact that it's a milky, non-foaming cleanser is somewhat comforting, especially during the colder winter months. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-hydrating-micellar-water) \\- this shit will sting your eyes if you're not careful, it's probably because of the high niacinamide content. Other than that, I think it's fine. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Bioderma Sensibio H2O*](https://incidecoder.com/products/bioderma-sensibio-h2o) \\- i mean, this is fine. I don't think it's really worth how much it cost compared to all the options we have now, but this was the first micellar water if I'm not wrong so, pop off I guess. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Garnier Skinactive Micellar Water All-In-1*](https://incidecoder.com/products/garnier-skinactive-micellar-cleansing-water-all-in-1) \\- i've probably emptied at least five bottles of this by now. If you're looking for a micellar water that's fuss-free, I recommend this one. It's cheap and easy, what's not to like. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Clinique City Block Purifying Charcoal Cleansing Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/clinique-city-block-purifying-charcoal-cleansing-gel) \\- i don't like this. Regardless this has been discontinued it seems. \n* [*su:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick*](https://incidecoder.com/products/su-m37-miracle-rose-cleansing-stick) \\- remember when cleansing sticks were so hyped up? yeah I didn't even finish this. Anyways it's been discontinued but this is not great. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Toners**:\n\n* [*Pyunkang Yul Mist Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner) \\- simple basic mist, it only has five ingredients. I didn't really expect much from it and it didn't really do much for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-toner-essence) \\- there's not much viscosity to this toner, it's pretty much water-like. If you're into minimal ingredients and eastern herbal medicine kinda vibe then you'll like this. It's not terrible, not great. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-toner) \\- if there had to be one toner I'd recommend from the Pyunkang Yul line it'd be this one. At least it has some botanical extracts that will help your skin along with niacinamide. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [Missha Time Revolution Clear Toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-clear-toner) \\- this has been discontinued, but I liked it has a morning cleansing toner. \n* [*klairs Fundamental Ampoule Mist*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-fundamental-ampoule-mist) \\- i enjoyed this mist, it sits in a base of green tea and contains a bunch of skin soothing ingredients. The actual mister itself was alright, it didn't produce the best misting experience. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-supple-preparation-facial-toner) \\- another cult favourite. This is probably the most viscous toners I've ever tried. I probably would prefer the essential oil free version of this much more, but regardless, I still think it's a good hydrating toner to slap on. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*By Wishtrend Mandelic Acid 5% Skin Prep Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/by-wishtrend-mandelic-acid-5-skin-prep-water) \\- this was a pretty good exfoliating toner, mandelic acid is one of the gentler AHAs to begin with and having it at 5% makes it super gentle I feel. If you're wanting to dip your toes into AHA and exfoliating, this is probably a good place to start. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. This looks like it's been reformulated once, to remove the hydrolyzed collagen to make this product vegan. \n* [*Son & Park Beauty Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/son-park-beauty-water) \\- i do not like this product. I know it's a cult favourite but even then it's kinda just meh in my eyes. Fragrance free. \n* [*I'm From Rice Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-rice-toner) \\- this is basically the Laneige Cream Skin, but the rice version, if that makes sense. They're both more moisturizing than hydrating. The only con with this toner is that it requires you to shake it before each use to make sure everything is emulsified together. Overall a good choice if you're someone who is lazy with skincare, since this and the Laneige Cream Skin is a multi-step product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Innisfree Artichoke Layering Light Skin*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-artichoke-layering-light-skin) \\- this product has been discontinued. Didn't hate this product, just a simple watery toner to layer.\n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Skin*](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_248d341348.html) \\- i just don't like anything from this line. I feel like it didn't really do anything for my skin, I'm probably more harsh on products that claim to help with acne as a person who suffers from acne myself. Fragrance and essential oil free. \n* [*Etude House Soonjung pH 5.5 Relief Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-soonjung-ph5-5-relief-toner) \\- if you're looking for some basic products, for some basic skin or introductory products into skincare, I fully believe the Soonjung line is perfect for that. I also believe this now comes in a jumbo size (350ml?). Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-1025-dokdo-toner-2) \\- this is what I use on a daily basis now as a morning wiping toner. It's gentle enough to wipe away the dirt without stripping the skin. Alternatively I also think it's hydrating enough to be used as a toner that you pat into the skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Skin*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-blueberry-rebalancing-skin) \\- i probably would like this toner a lot more if it didn't contain essential oils. It's a milky looking toner, but it's not moisturizing as the Laneige or I'm From toner. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*Cosrx Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-centella-water-alcohol-free-toner) \\- i mean, this was whatever. It's a very basic mist toner, and to be honest, probably didn't do much for my skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Natural Pacific (Nacific) Real Floral Toner Calendula*](https://incidecoder.com/products/nacific-real-floral-toner-calendula) \\- i wasn't really expecting much with this toner, but it kinda proved me wrong. While I think the calendula petals in the actual bottle is kinda of a gimmick it did soothe my skin and feel rather nice on my face. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*TonyMoly The Black Tea London Classic Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/tony-moly-the-black-tea-london-classic-toner) \\- this was oddly viscous somehow, it's probably due to the cyclomethicone being in there. That being said, I didn't really enjoy this toner either. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Cosrx One Step Moisture Up Pad*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-one-step-moisture-up-pad) \\- i've also tried the original pads from cosrx and I gotta say, I just don't like pads. I think they're overpriced for what they are. The only pro is that they're good for travel. Other than that I'm just not on the pad hype train. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n\n**First Essences:**\n\n* [*Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence (Rose Edition)*](https://incidecoder.com/products/secret-key-starting-treatment-essence-rose-edition) \\- simple ingredient list, no fuss, and somewhat affordable. Now does the rose ingredients in here really make a difference, probably not, but this has a cleaner ingredient list than the standard one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Scinic First Treatment Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/scinic-first-treatment-essence) \\- if you're looking to delve into this whole fermented first essence experience. Scinic is probably the best one to start off with, simple ingredient list and affordable. \n* *the Saem The Essential Glactomyces First Essence* \\- it looks like they renewed the packaging for this and it now comes in a reddish purple bottle. The ingredients look the same though it's just 100% galactomyces ferment filtrate. Regardless, this felt oddly greasy? Maybe it's because it's just that one ingredient but it felt greasy and weird to me. Hard pass. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free. \n* *Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence (Intensive Moist & Intensive)* \\- not really a reason for me to go into this as they renew the formula every two years or so. The Intensive Moist and Intensive versions have been discontinued. And yes, I did buy the Line Friends edition simply because it looked so cute. \n* [*Benton Fermentation Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-fermentation-essence) \\- so, why is this only 100ml? Feels kinda overpriced for what it is. Regardless, I wouldn't really suggest this unless you really want to try it or you're a Benton diehard fan. Looks like it's been reformulated. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence Homme*](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-homme-the-first-treatment-essence-200ml) \\- gasp, a male marketed product? The only reason I wanted to try this instead of the regular current version was that it contains more volume, it didn't come in a glass bottle because I drop shit all the time, and it looked like it was formulated for more oily skin. In the end, this was just whatever for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-artemisia-treatment-essence) \\- ok this product is a hit. I really like this product and if you're someone who can't stand traditional eastern medicinal scent, I don't really think you'll like this. But I love how this smells and to be honest, it's probably why I like it so much. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free.\n* [*I'm From Mugwort Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-essence) \\- basically the same thing as the Missha one, but I prefer the Missha one because it's cheaper and the scent in the Missha one is stronger for some reason most likely because Missha ferments the extract? Who knows. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free.\n* [*su:m37 Secret Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/su-m37-su-m37-secret-programming-essence) \\- i don't think this is worth it, it's so expensive and ingredient list is like 50+. Plus there's a shit ton of EO in this product. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Serums:**\n\n* [*Hado Labo Gokujyun Premium*](https://incidecoder.com/products/hada-labo-gokujyun-premium) \\- so i'm sure everyone and their mom has tried something from Hado Labo at this point. If you're looking for something that is hydrating and affordable and that will help with inner dryness, this is the product for you. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence) \\- if you want to try something with snail in it just get this. Probably the most affordable one out of the bunch, probably the best one on the market still. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Mizon Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule*](https://incidecoder.com/products/mizon-snail-repair-intensive-ampoule) \\- i feel like this is another OG AB cult favourite. I mean compared to the COSRX one this one is whatever. It does contain peptides but for the price and the size it comes in, I rather just purchase the COSRX one. Fragrance and essential oil free.\n* *Missha Time Revolution Night Repair Science Activator Borabit Ampoule* \\- some of these product names are so goddamn long. Anyways this is discontinued, I believe the new ampoule is much more thicker and has prebiotics in the formula now. I also think they added EO to the new ampoule. \n* [*Skin1004 Madagascar Centella-Asiatica 100*](https://incidecoder.com/products/skin1004-madagascar-centella-asiatica-100-ampoule) \\- this product has been repackaged but the ingredients are the same, just 100% centella extract. To be honest I did enjoy this product and it's quite affordable. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-buffet-serum-3) \\- for what it is, it's fine. Probably go get the unscented version since the scent is quite strong. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Niod Multi-Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Complex*](https://incidecoder.com/products/niod-multi-molecular-hyaluronic-complex-2-mmhc2) \\- this is expensive. I rather much prefer the Marine Hyaluronics from The Ordinary. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Midnight blue Youth Activating Drop*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-midnight-blue-youth-activating-drop-3) \\- this is tiny and expensive. I like how it's a pretty blue colour, but to be honest, the size of it doesn't warrant the price. Also I had a terrible experience getting this item from Wishtrend when they had a whole batch of it go bad because it was stored at the wrong temperature. \n* [*Niod Survival 0*](https://incidecoder.com/products/niod-survival-0-2018) \\- i actually like this product! I think the orange tint that it comes in is a pit off-putting but it doesn't leave any stains or transfer or have any tint whatsoever. I think it pairs pretty well with any vitamin c product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Marine Hyaluronics*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-marine-hyaluronics) \\- is it weird that I like the smell of this? Regardless, I do prefer this much more than the traditional HA that The Ordinary also offers. I really don't see much difference with this and the MMHC2 from Niod. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-alpha-arbutin-2-ha) \\- i rather much prefer the vitamin c + alpha arbutin. This by itself is quite redundant IMO. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-niacinamide-10-zinc-1) \\- ok so this isn't the most cosmetically elegant and the formula is rather basic, but I'm not going to spend basically $60 CAD for the Paula's Choice one. I will admit the PC one is much more easier to apply, but I'm cheap. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Buffet*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-buffet) \\- this didn't really wow me, I think it's a good basic anti-aging serum.  Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-resveratrol-3-ferulic-acid-3) \\- i just mixed this in with my vitamin c to give it an additional boost, because it's sitting in a base of propanediol it doesn't give it an oily feeling, but most of TO products come sitting in a base of that. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Vitamin-C:**\n\n* [*Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-c-firma-day-serum) \\- i kinda don't get the hype over DE? I mean this was nice, but I don't think it warrants the price, plus because this uses l-ascorbic acid and it's water based it oxidizes pretty quickly, regardless of the packaging. I think there are better options out there for the fraction of the price. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-l-ascorbic-acid-powder) \\- i mean this was ok, but you can purchase bulk vitamin c powder online and do the exact same thing but cheaper? I guess this is for people who rather just mix their vitamin c into a toner or serum and call it day. I will say that this did sting the most out of all the vitamin c I've used, probably because you know, it's straight up vitamin c powder and the measuring spoon isn't the best. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside 12%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-ascorbyl-glucoside-solution-12) \\- i believe this is the only vitamin c TO offers that sits in a base of water. Regardless, this is a derivative of vitamin c so it doesn't offer the powerful punch that traditional vitamin c offers. But I did like it texturally compared to the others, since this doesn't sit in a base of propanediol. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Ole Henriksen Truth Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/olehenriksen-truth-serum) \\- i got ths as a gift so... yeah. I really don't like this. Alcohol free.\n* [*It's Skin Power 10 Formula VC Effector*](https://incidecoder.com/products/its-skin-power-10-formula-vc-effector) \\- this was also meh, pass. Alcohol and essential oil free. \n* [*Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC*](https://incidecoder.com/products/rohto-mentholatum-melano-cc-vitamin-c-essence) \\- so this is another cult favourite, while I did enjoy this, I kinda hate the packaging? I understand it's to keep the vitamin c from oxidizing, but I got a big face so I need a lot of this for my face so having to wait for each single drop to come out is a bit annoying. The amount is also quite small sitting at 20ml. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*goodal green tangerine vita C dark spot serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/goodal-green-tangerine-vita-c-dark-spot-serum) \\-  i think korea is just getting into vitamin c since I do see new products with actual l-ascorbic acid instead of citrus fruit punch with some derivatives sprinkled in there. This is citrus fruit punch and it's full of EO, so I wouldn't really recommend this. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-freshly-juiced-vitamin-drop) \\- so this would be a fine beginner vitamin c serum but it does also contain EO. Also the packaging isn't UV resistant so you need to keep this somewhere dark and away from sunlight. Probably better options out there if you're wanting to try vitamin C. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Retinols**:\n\n* [*Differin Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/differin-differin-gel) \\-  so as someone who has been on accutane three times (and a bunch of other drugs), Differin is a godsend. I know La Roche Posay now offers their version which is cheaper than Diffferin, and you can get a higher concentration of adapalene if you get a prescription. While this doesn't clear my acne 100% it's removed probably around 90% of it. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Life-flo Retinol A 1% Advanced Revitalization Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/life-flo-retinol-a-1-advanced-revitalization-cream) \\- so I bought this to see if it would help with my KP on my arms, didn't do jack shit. Unfortunately I've come to realize that severe KP is untreatable. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-granactive-retinoid-2-emulsion) \\- i prefer this the most when it comes to TO and their retinoid line. Since granactive retinoid is so new I'm not really sure if it doesn't much like tretinion and other vitamin a derivatives, but it is a moisturizing emulsion if anything. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-granactive-retinoid-5-in-squalane) \\- yeah the emulsion is better. I also cannot stand squalane oil for some reason. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Other Actives(?)**:\n\n* [*cosrx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-aha-7-whitehead-power-liquid) \\- so I'm not sure what it is, but my skin does not agree with any of the cosrx chemical exfoliants. This and the BHA one made me breakout, and I've used other AHA/BHA products before. Regardless, I resorted to using this on my arms (for my KP), didn't really do much for the KP. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) \\- read above. Also this doesn't even contain any saliycylic acid so... yeah no. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution - it looks like this product is going through reformulation currently. I'm using the Paula's Choice BHA Liquid right now and I prefer the PC one more, even if it's more expensive. \n* Benzoyl Peroxide - i mean this is just 5% benzoyl peroxide I get from my drug store. I am a strong believer of pairing benzoyl peroxide with other acne medication to make sure you're doubling down on the acne. \n\n**Oils**:\n\n* [*The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-plant-derived-squalane) \\- look i'm not the best person to review oils, since I still have generally quite oily skin. If anything oils usually get mixed into my body moisturizer to give more occlusivity. Also I hate the feeling of squalane for some reason. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-organic-cold-pressed-rose-hip-seed-oil) \\- so I bought this because people kept saying rose hip oil is good for hyperpigmentation, but yeah, my face couldn't handle the oily feeling so it went straight on my body! Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-virgin-marula-luxury-facial-oil) \\- ok why does this cost so much? I've heard this feels much more lighter than other marula oils but still, this costs an arm and a leg. Probably not really worth it. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Moisturizers**:\n\n* [*cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-oil-free-ultra-moisturizing-lotion-with-birch-sap) \\- i don't really like this. It was fine? But now that I found another birch juice/sap moisturizer that one is 100% better than this one. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha) \\- look, you cannot fault this product as it is extremely cheap ($5 for 100ml during this year's Black Friday sale), and the ingredients are decent. If you're looking for a basic moisturizer, just get this one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Emulsion*](https://incidecoder.com/products/papa-recipe-eggplant-clearing-emulsion) \\- yeah no I really don't like this line. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*cosrx Aloe Vera Oil-Free Moisture Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-aloe-vera-oil-free-moisture-cream) \\- probably better to just get an aloe vera gel if you're eyeing at this product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-rich-moist-soothing-cream) \\- i found this too heavy for my skin, plus it's filled with EO. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-midnight-blue-calming-cream-8) \\- now this cream was much better for me. While I believe it's supposed to be used a spot treatment to calm down irritated skin, I just used this all over. I also believe there is a tube format of this now if you hate jar packaging. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Mizon Black Snail All In One Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/mizon-black-snail-aio-cream) \\- not much to say about this cream, didn't really stand out to me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-birch-juice-moisturizing-cream) \\- k this is really good. If you have oily skin, I really recommend this. It kinda feels like you're applying water because the cream just melts and sinks in immediately. It's extremely hydrating and perfect for oily skin as it doesn't feel too occlusive or leave any stickiness. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-aloe-propolis-soothing-gel) \\- i mean this is a decent aloe gel, I just don't think I'm a fan of aloe gels in general as it leaves a sticky feeling behind. This would probably be best if you are sunburnt as it as a nice cooling effect on the skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Inkey List Multi-Biotic*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-inkey-list-multi-biotic) \\- this stinks, so if you do not like your moisturizer smelling like basically yogurt, then pass this one. I found it quite cool and tolerable. The scent doesn't 100% disappear but it doesn't linger if that makes sense. You really have to smell hard to actually smell it after applying it. This was just ok for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Dr. G RED Blemish Clear Soothing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-g-red-blemish-clear-soothing-cream) \\- this is really highly ranked of Hwahae so I decided to try it. I found it alright as it was occlusive but not pore clogging feeling, while it's not the most hydrating this is probably better for dryer skin types as it provides that nice seal. As for decreasing redness, I didn't really see much of a difference. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-cream) \\- didn't really do much for my acne but it is a nice gel moisturizer, not something really rave about though. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [cosrx Centella Blemish Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-centella-blemish-cream) \\- i've recommended this to so many people. I feel like this is really soothes my acne or makes them completely disappear if they're non-cystic ones. I've emptied countless jars of this and I always have one of these on me at all times. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation Perfecting Moisturizer*](https://incidecoder.com/products/olehenriksen-sheer-transformation-r-perfecting-moisturizer) \\- i don't hate this surprisingly? What really shocked me was that this was EO and fragrance free unlike their truth serum. I think this is a good morning moisturizer to pair with your vitamin c as it does contain a handful of antioxidants. A little also goes a long way as it spreads pretty well. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-lala-retro-whipped-cream) \\- i am probably the worst person to ask about DE. But once again I didn't like this product. It probably was too rich for my oily skin, I just really can't stomach the prices of their products. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Benton Fermentation Eye Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-fermentation-eye-cream-2) \\- i'm not really a believer in eye cream so I'm probably the worst person to review this, but yeah, this didn't really change my thoughts on eye creams. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Sunscreens**:\n\n* *CeraVe Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Body Lotion* \\- i think this has been discontinued as I can't find it anywhere, but this was not it. It states to have invisible zinc technology but it was still so pasty and white. I'm only tossing this because I'm pretty sure it's passed the use by date. \n* [*Murad City Skin Age Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/murad-city-skin-age-defense-broad-spectrum-spf-50-pa) \\- so this uses zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as it's filter. It's a pretty elegant physical sunscreen if you can look past the price. I think the tint helps it so that it doesn't have a white cast, at least on my skin tone. You gotta shake this before using this. One downside to this sunscreen is that it does feel greasy for me, and it's not water/sweat resistant so it will rub off with the tint. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Troiareuke Acsen U.V Protector Essence SPF 50+ PA+++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/ascen-uv-protector-essence) \\- combinational sunscreen that uses octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, tinosorb s, titanium dioxide, Univul T 150 as it's filters. The only gripe I have with this is that it does contain fragrance. It's pretty expensive as well. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50+ PA ++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-soft-airy-uv-essence-spf50-pa) \\- so this is awkward. With the whole Purito thing has shaked things up and a lot of Korean sunscreens are now under investigation for having lower than advertised SPF ratings. Univul A Plus and Univul T 150 are the filters for this sunscreen and to be honest since they've stopped the sale of this sunscreen and I'm not sure what will happen to it. We'll see how things end up with this whole debacle but I did enjoy using this if that matters at all.\n* *innisfree perfect UV protection cream triple care SPF 50+ PA+++* \\-  this has been discontinued, but god roadshop brands have the worst fragrances. I'm pretty sure I gave up using this because I could not handle the fragrance. \n* *Mamonde Everyday Aqua Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA++++* \\- again, the fragrance, why. This also has been discontinued. \n* *innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Watery Sun Cream SPF37 PA+++* \\- so this has been reformulated and repackaged, I believe it's now SPF 45 PA+++. I don't the SPF increase really changed much in the formula, it uses titanium dioxide only. But it does have EO. Also shake the product before using it. \n* [*innisfree The minimum sun cream SPF 25 PA++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-the-minimum-sun-cream-spf25-pa) \\- so, idk why I got this sunscreen. Because I think this is either meant for babies or people with extremely sensitive skin. Either way, if you're either of those, probably one to pick up. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* *Missha all-around Safe Block Mild Sun SPF 30 PA++* \\- this has been discontinued as well, once again, not sure why I got this. As it's pretty low protection and is probably meant for babies or people with extremely sensitive skin. \n* [*Etude House UV Double Cut Fresh Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA ++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-uv-double-cut-fresh-sun-gel-spf50-pa) \\- this one has a more tolerable fragrance but it's still not great. If you're ok with EO, alcohol and fragrance in your sunscreen then go ahead. It's inexpensive and does provide good coverage as it uses octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, Unival A Plus, and Univul T 150. But I really just wish brands would stop putting fragrance in their sunscreens, I'm fine with mine smelling like chemicals. \n* *Hyggee Chu Chu Sun Pact SPF43 PA+++* \\- discontinued and yes I did buy it because Pucca was on it. \n\n**Body Care**:\n\n* [*CeraVe Moisuturizing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-moisturizing-cream) \\- i'm pretty sure everyone has tried this before. To me, I think any old body moisturizer performs just as well as this one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*CeraVe Renewing SA Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-renewing-sa-cream) \\- so apparently this is supposedly too high of a pH for the salicylic acid to do much, according to Beautypedia. I bought this in hopes to combat my KP, but it didn't really do much. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*illiyoon ceramide ato 6.0 top to toe wash*](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ceramide-ato-6-0-top-to-toe-wash) \\- i do like this body wash, it's quite gentle but it doesn't produce any lather, so if you want that bubbly foam fantasy this isn't the product for you. It leaves a film behind, which apparently is what low pH cleansers feel like? But regardless, the film isn't con as I really don't notice it after awhile. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*illiyoon ultra repair moisture cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ultra-repair-moisture-cleanser) \\- i prefer their ato cleanser more, this has fragrance and I don't think the added oils in this formula moisturize my skin anymore than the ato one. Alcohol free.\n\n**Powders**:\n\n* [*innisfree no-sebum Mineral Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-no-sebum-mineral-powder-2) \\- cult favourite, but their newer powder has won over my heart. Still this is not bad as a mattifying powder. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*innisfree Pore Blur Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-pore-blur-powder) \\- so this is like a better version of the no-sebum powder. It also doesn't include fragrance! Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Masks**:\n\n* [*I'm From Mugwort Mask*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-mask) \\- this mask is great for cooling the skin down, also I'm addicted to the smell of mugwort so this was a dream come true. It's just a hassle to wash off as there are pieces of mugwort in this mask. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.",

So I thought it would be useful to put together a series of posts that goes over some of the very basics. My hope is that each one will be as close to a “I know nothing” post as possible. I’ll keep editing them as I learn more. If anyone knows of anything I missed, or if there are certain things that you want to know about in more detail, please drop a comment in the posts or send me a message.\n\n## Makeup for Newbies Series Table of Contents:\n\n**Makeup for Newbies Part One - Skincare**\n\n[Makeup for Newbies Part Two - Primers, beard coverage, color correction, and prepping for foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/qizi34/makeup_for_newbies_part_two_primers_beard/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[Makeup for Newbies Part Three - Tools of the Trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/qljo29/makeup_for_newbies_tools_of_the_trade/)\n\n[Foundation for Newbies Part One – Foundation Types](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/qrw1bo/foundation_for_newbies_part_one_foundation_types/)\n\n[Foundation for Newbies Part Two – Foundation Color](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/qsmsby/foundation_for_newbies_part_two_foundation_color/)\n\n## Skin Care, the foundation of it all\n\nSo the first thing to talk about when talking about makeup isn’t actually makeup at all. It’s skin care. If you think of makeup as painting, then your face is the canvas. And you are going to have a hard time getting a beautiful painting done if the canvas is rough and damaged.\n\nThere are a lot of different products on the market. Product is just a fancy word for the stuff you buy, but it is used all over the place. It has no other special meaning. Facial skin care products can generally be broken up into four major categories: cleansers, toners, serums, and lotions.\n\n**Cleanser:** This is just a fancy term for face soap, though there are a ton of variations that include additional ingredients. Always start with this to remove excess oil. Especially important pre-hrt, as cis male skin generally produces more oil than cis female skin, and that's taken into account with makeup and the like. If you use hot water to wash, and you should, then splash cold water on your face before moving on. It closes your pores back up, which helps keep you from getting pimples from makeup or dirt.\n\n**Toner:** Closes your pores, and often times soothes irritation. Some toners claim to reduce the appearance of pores. It usually comes in a larger bottle, and is one of the cheaper parts of the skin care routine. It doesn’t do much for actually moisturizing your skin, it more gets your skin ready for what comes next.\n\n**Serum:** This is a combination of heavy duty moisturizing agents that come in a little vial. You normally get it out using an eye dropper built into the lid. The product inside is extremely concentrated, and you only need a little. The consistency is usually somewhere between oil and water. Common ingredients are hyaluronic acid, collagen, vitamins (especially a, c, and e), and retinol. You can get a lot of bang for your buck out of serums, and they can make a really big difference. They may be more expensive, but you use very little.\n\n**Face Lotion:** This normally comes in a little jar or tube, and generally serves to moisturize your skin, keep it smooth, and protect it. Like the rest, it can include a bunch of additional ingredients. In addition many face lotions are also sun screens, though normally no stronger than SPF 15. They normally make two major kinds of face lotion, daytime and nighttime. The nighttime version is usually just a lot thicker, and stays put longer, but can give you a greasy look. That totally works if you are going to go to sleep and need it to stay all night while your face rubs on a pillow, but is less than ideal for daytime. Daytime lotions are generally lighter and go on smooth so you can’t see them. If you are going to get just one, get a daytime face cream. It can server both functions.\n\nNever ever use body lotion on your face. It is usually full of oils that will clog your pores, get in the way of your makeup sticking to your face, and just generally cause problems.\n\nIn addition to these major types of products, there are a few specialized products of note.\n\n**Undereye Cream / Undereye Lotion:** This is specially formulated lotion designed for the bags under you eyes. The skin under your eyes is extremely delicate and is easily damaged. It also has unique properties that cause things like puffiness, discoloration, and the like. Undereye creams are specially formulated to help with the skin there. Specifically, it helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and sooths and reduces the appearance of bags.\n\n**Eyelash Serum:** This is special serum that is applied directly to your eyelashes to encourage growth. It usually comes in a little tube, and is applied using an included brush. This can also be applied to eyebrows to help them grow as well. Using serum will help protect and strengthen your eyelashes if you use false eyelashes.\n\nAs a side note on ingredients: If you are going to get your face lasered or waxed any time soon, avoid anything with retinol. It gives you more youthful appearance, but it thins your skin and makes it more susceptible to sunburn. Reputable places won't laser you if you've used retinol any time recently.\n\n## The skin care routine\n\nFor best results, you should do your skin care routine twice a day. The first time is in the morning after your shower (if you are a morning showerer), and after you shave, but before you put any makeup on. The second is at night after you have removed your makeup and before bed.\n\nThe correct order to apply the different products is cleanser, then toner, then serum, then lotion. Eye cream generally goes on before lotion, but it doesn’t really matter either way. I like to put eyelash serum on after toner as it’s easiest then, but again it doesn’t really matter as long as it is after you use a cleanser.\n\n**Applying Cleanser:** Different cleansers are different in how they want you to apply them. Some need your face to be wet before hand, while others want you to rub them onto dry skin before washing them off. So make sure and follow any directions for the specific cleanser you get. I personally find the ones that are applied after your skin is wet to be easiest to use. But it is really up to personal preference and what your skin reacts well to.\n\n**Applying Toner:** You apply toner to a dry face using a cotton ball or cotton pad. If you have any beard stubble little cotton threads can be left behind. You can avoid that by making sure to have a very close shave. You can also apply toner using your fingers if you want.\n\n**Applying Serum:** You only need a few drops for your face. I do two drops for forehead, two drops each cheek and side of of face, two drops in the chin, and two for my neck, for a total of 10 drops. How much you use will vary depending on your skin. Just remember that a little goes a long way. Serum is extremely concentrated, so you don’t need much. Some serums suggest that you can add them to your face lotion before putting it on. I prefer to put the serum on directly, as I feel it absorbs better. Some serum can give a burning sensation as it hydrates your face, especially the first few times you use it. If it gets really bad, or if it doesn’t go away, you may need to try a different serum. It could be that the serum doesn’t play nicely with your other products. In general it isn’t an issue, and I have extremely sensitive skin.\n\n**Applying Lotion:** Just like with serum, the best way to put on face lotion is to put a dot on your forehead, one on each cheek, one on your chin, and one on your neck, and then massage it into your face. You do not need to use a lot. If your face is completely shiny and soaked after you have spread it out, you probably used too much.\n\nMake sure that you allow time for each product to dry before moving onto the next. It could take as much as a minute for them to absorb.\n\n## Exfoliation, a girl’s best friend\n\nAnother thing that is really important is to make sure that your face is exfoliated. Exfoliation just refers to the process of removing dead skin cells from your body. Over time the top layer of your skin dies, and these cells build up over time. It’s good to exfoliate everywhere on your body, but it is especially important for your face when you wear makeup. The dead skin cells will give your face a rough texture, which will become more noticeable after you put makeup on. Dead skin cells will also increase the chance of getting ingrown hairs from shaving or acne from the makeup. If you shave with a razor this will remove some of the dead skin, but not all. You will need to use an exfoliator of some kind to get the rest off.\n\nHow often you exfoliate will depend on many factors, most of which have to do with your skin. But in general you should exfoliate at least once a week. Be careful not to exfoliate too often. You can damage your skin if you exfoliate too often.\n\nExfoliants come in two major varieties, manual and chemical. In all cases only use exfoliating methods on the face if they are specifically created to do that. Most skin on your body is far tougher than your face, and can take a lot more punishment. You risk damaging the skin of your face if you use the wrong kind.\n\nManual exfoliants use some kind of abrasive to rub the dead skin cells off. Cream based manual exfoliators are extremely easy to use. One of the gentlest are sugar scrubs, and it’s my go to for my face. They use sugar crystals to do the rubbing, which then easily wash away when you are done. A little higher on the abrasiveness spectrum are salt scrubs. These are starting to get really aggressive, but they still wash away easily. Next higher are exfoliators that use crushed pumice rock. In general these will be extremely abrasive, and may really irritate some people’s skin. I wouldn't recommend anything this abrasive for the face for most people.\n\nTo use any of the cream exfoliants, apply a small amount to your skin and then rub in small circles, going over your whole face. Avoid your eye lids and the area directly under your eye. Both these areas are too sensitive, and you will damage them if you try to exfoliate there. As you go, you should see the dead skin build up. When you are done, wash it all away.\n\nAnother form of manual exfoliant are pads that look kind of like sand paper. (Never use actual sand paper on any skin on your body. The grains can come off and embed in your skin.) Normally they are used by a microdermabrasion machine. These spin the little plates over your skin while creating a vacuum, sucking the dead skin cells away. These are generally expensive, and are probably not worth it when just starting out. But know that they exist, and are an option for those who like them.\n\nThe other major kind of exfoliant are chemical exfoliants. These are also often called chemical peels. They use some kind of chemical to cause your skin to fall off on its own. Two chemical exfoliants that people are very familiar with are salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, two popular acne treatments. They work by helping the old dead skin cells to fall off, opening the pores and letting the stuck oil and dirt get out.\n\nThere are many other kinds of chemical exfoliants, many of which are only available by going to a salon. Some kinds can even only be done by a doctor. You have to be very careful with chemical exfoliants, as misusing them can cause chemical burns. Any time you use one, read the directions carefully, and follow them to the letter. Also be careful if you have sensitive skin, as they can really irritate you skin. Be careful about going out in the sun afterwards, and be aware that many may keep you from being able to wax or get laser hair removal for awhile after use.\n\n## Shaving\n\nIf you have a beard, you will want to shave it off. You need as close a shave as possible. I recommend using a safety razor. It will get you an extremely close shave, but is easier to master than a straight razor. When it comes to safety razors, the brand of blade matters. I can’t give you any recommendations, though, as each face reacts to different brands differently. The best thing to do is to get a safety blade handle and then buy a sampler pack of blades. That way you can experiment and find out what works best for you. Shaving is an art, and one that I’ve yet to master. But the key to a very feminine look is to hide your beard, and that means a very close shave. The only way to do that is with wet shaving. Electric won’t get a close enough shave. Some people may be ok with cartridges, but even they only cut so close. Safety blades and old school straight blades will give you the closest possible shave. You will want to shave against the grain for best results. Just be careful, as this increases the chance of ingrown hairs.\n\nI find it is far easier to shave in the shower. I got a mirror for the wall that is designed to get wet to keep from getting foggy. After a few minutes in the hot steam and under hot water, your hairs will soften and stand up. That’s when you want to shave. Use a good quality shaving cream, preferably using a brush to put it on. That will help lift the individual hairs off your skin and stand them upright so they can be cut. You can also use your facial cleanser as a shaving lotion. For me that works better, as they are clear and so I can see what I’m doing. But according to the experts, a good boar bristle brush and shaving cream works best. Make sure and use cold water after you shave to close up the pores again. That will help keep you from getting acne or irritation.\n\n## Putting it all together\n\nSo now that we’ve gone over the different parts of skin care and skin prep for makeup, it’s time to put it all together. The first thing to do is to exfoliate your skin. That will remove dead skin and allow you to get a closer shave. After that, shave, and then exfoliate again with something like a sugar scrub if any skin peels while shaving. Then use a cleanser to remove any remaining oil, dead skin, and cut hair. Splash cold water onto your face, then dry your face by patting it dry.\n\nAfter that, you’ll move on to your moisturizing routine. Start by applying toner. If you were going to skip a product, cleanser is usually the one to skip, as I don’t feel it generally adds much. But that may just be my skin. If you get a lot of razor burn from shaving (which if you have the right blade you shouldn’t), toner can really help calm your skin down.\n\nAfter the toner is dry, move on to your eyelash serum if you are using one. Then put on your serum, followed by your eye cream and then facial lotion. And then that’s it, you are ready to put on makeup.\n\nAt night you will use a cleanser after you remove your makeup (which I’ll cover in another post), then you will use your cleanser to remove any remaining makeup, then splash your face with cold water. Pat dry, and then follow the same routine as the morning. If you choose, you can use a nighttime lotion instead of a daytime lotion. This can be especially helpful if you have very dry skin.\n\nI hope this helps people out. There is so much to learn, and I feel that so much of the time tutorials expect you to already know a lot of this stuff. Let me know in the comments if there is anything that you think I missed, or that you think I could add.\n\nI hope all of you ladies have a wonderful day. And remember, you are all beautiful, and you are worth it!",

The comment section here can be really helpful, but it was getting quite long, so we thought it would be good to start a new Beginner thread.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMany people come to look to revamp their current routines or create a new routine. While not all of the products mentioned here will work for 100% of people, this is a good place to start regardless of skin type/concern. \n\nThe products mentioned are those commonly recommended on the sub and by no means is it comprehensive. In addition, the products mentioned here tend to be affordable/widely available/effective for most people.\n\n**But PLEASE keep in mind that skincare is not an exact science and no one can guarantee success for an individual.**\nRecommendations on here have been the most well tolerated that we've encountered and users report a high degree of success with them. However, sensitivities are possible with any product and no product can guarantee 100% efficacy and tolerance in an entire population.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFirst,  **stop** using St. Ives Apricot Scrub!!! The particles are large, non-uniform, sharp, and too abrasive to be suitable for facial use. Also, ditch any citrus fruits on the face and baking soda scrubs. More info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/195lue/psa_please_do_not_use_baking_soda_on_your_skin_it/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/13wz1y/psa_lemons_and_limes_great_for_food_not_for_skin/). \n\nNext, **don't buy everything at once: include only 1 new product at a time**. Don't buy a new full blown routine if you don't need it!   Be patient, take your time, and **[Test patch](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/14sd25/i_just_learned_how_to_do_a_test_patch_properly/).**  .\n\nIf you can't seem to find a particular product in your country, a few online stores/companies can be helpful and ship internationally. These include [sasa](http://web1.sasa.com/SasaWeb/splash.jsp), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/), [iherb](http://www.iherb.com/), and [mmmule](http://mmmule.com/). \n\nNow, onto recommendations!!\n\n\n- **Cleanser** \n\n  We frequently tell folks it's not necessary to cleanse 2x a day, particularly for those suffering with oily/dehydrated/dry skin types. Exceptions include things like post-workouts or if you've been sweating through the night.\n\n  If your skin is feeling tight/dry/squeaky after cleansing, you should look for a new cleanser.\n\n  *Cleanser Recs*\n  \n  ~ Cerave Foaming (US/Canada): Suitable for acne prone\n\n  ~ Cerave Hydrating (US/Canada): Better for non-acne prone/dry\n\n  ~ Spectro Jel (Canada): Suitable for acne-prones\n\n  ~ Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash (UK/US/Canada/other?): Potentially suitable for all skin types\n\n  ~ Eucerin DermatoClean, \"gentle\" (Worldwide): Suitable for sensitive/acne prone\n\n  ~ [Oil Cleansing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/): Suitable for almost all skin types, but the oil/oils you use depends on your skin type. Those with SD should tread lightly with this method, as some oils can exacerbate the issue.\n\n  \n- **Exfoliation**\n\n  Chemical exfoliation is the preferred method on /r/skincareaddiction, it tends to be more gentle than physical exfoliation *and* you can do it daily. You can learn more about the different types of chemical exfoliators in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1hj8yo/whats_the_difference_ahas_vs_bhas/) sidebar post.  \n\n  Lactic acid is the most gentle, so if you suffer with eczema/rosacea prone sensitive skin, start with lactic.  If you're acne prone/have lots of clogs and/or oily, start with a BHA (salicylic acid). If you are combo, and want the humectant benefits of an AHA, try Mandelic---partly oil soluble AHA. \n\n  Physical exfoliation (yes this includes a washcloth and the Clarisonic!) should not be used more than 1-2x a week, and not if you have active acne, sensitive, flaking, or irritated skin.\n\n  Exfoliation will be beneficial if you have any of the following concerns (not comprehensive): zits, uneven texture, congestion, blackheads, whiteheads, dull skin, dry skin, [sebaceous filaments (SFs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/), etc.\n\n  Since AHAs/BHAs work at a lower pH to exfoliate, it's helpful to wait a few minutes before applying your next product (ie-moisturizer). If you don't have time to wait that length of time, at least wait until the AHA/BHA is dry.\n\n   Aim to use the AHAs in the PM--these cause photosensitivity. BHAs are more flexible, but when you can, do your exfoliation in the PM.\n\n  *BHA exfoliator recs (alcohol free)*\n\n  ~ Stridex Maximum Strength Pads aka Stridex in the red box (US/available on iherb or Vitacost): 2% salicylic. If known serious sensitivity to light fragrance/menthol proceed with caution. These tend to work fine for the majority of people\n\n  ~ Paula's Choice BHAs (Worldwide): Fragrance-free options, but pricier than stridex\n\n  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Various BHA products\n  \n  ~ Neutrogena 3 in 1 Oil Free Acne Stress Control Hydrating Acne Treatment (Various locations): 2% SA, light fragrance, contains 'cones.\n\n  *AHA exfoliator recs*\n\n  ~ St Ives Scrub Free Exfoliating Pads (US): 4-5% lactic acid. If very sensitive to fragrance or known fruit allergies, proceed with caution.\n\n  ~ Silk Naturals AHA Toner (US based but will ship to some international locations): 8% Lactic acid. Contains aloe. Fragrance-free.\n\n  ~ Paula's Choice AHAs (Worldwide): Varying concentrations of glycolic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir (Worldwide): 8-10% glycolic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Varying Glycolic/lactic/ AHA+BHA combos\n\n  ~ Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (US/International through iHerb): 10% glycolic acid, fragrance free\n\n  ~ Alpha Hydrox Swipes or Intensive Serum ( US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 14% glycolic acid, fragrance free\n\n  ~ MUAC Mandelic Serum (US/ ships internationally): 10% mandelic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ Avene Cleanance K (US/Canada/Europe/Aussie/possibly other locations): AHA/BHA product.  2% Lactic, 6% Glycolic, and 1% Salicylic. Slightly more expensive than the other recommendations. Fragrance-free.\n\n- **Moisturize**\n\n  Everyone needs a moisturizer, even those with oily skin!  A lot of the time at least part of the oil production is commonly due to dehydration (aka lack of moisture). \n\n  *Moisturizer Recs*\n\n  ~ Cerave Cream aka Cerave in the tub (US/Canada): Suitable for any skin type. Also works for the body. Fast absorbing, lots of humectants/ceramides. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/) thread has info on getting a pump lid for the jar.\n  \n  ~ Oilatum Natural Repair (UK): Suitable for any skin type. Similar to Cerave in the tub, though a tad more greasy. \n\n  ~ Cetaphil Lotion/Cream (Many locations worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Slightly greasier formula to Cerave in the tub. \n\n  ~ Vaseline  (Worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Good to add on top of moisturizer, or use alone to prevent water loss.\n\n  ~ EltaMD Intense Moisturizer (US): Vaseline alternative, non-sticky/day friendly option.\n\n\n- **Sunscreen**\n\n  This is your choice, just be sure to wear it everyday and it's at least SPF30 with high UVA protection. It's even more crucial  if you're using AHAs, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or you're on particular oral medications.\n\n  Proper amount for application is 2mg/cm^2. This is about 1/4 teaspoon (~1.2 mL) for the face alone. Reapplication should be every 1.5-2 hours (maybe even more depending on how nasty the UV index will be that day), and after every time you take a dunk in water. \n\n  Recommendations highly vary depending on location and type of finish you prefer. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15tuqd/for_those_interested_in_trying_out_new_susncreens/) sidebar link on sunscreens gives you all you need to know.  Also, try a board search and look on the first few pages of the sub.\n\n  Generally, if you are very sensitive or acne prone, you'll want to look for an all physical sunscreen or at least a physical/chemical combo.  All chemical sunscreens tend to cause stinging/breakouts/irritation for many people.\n\n- **Spot Treatments/Masks**\n\n  This will vary based on your skin type, personal preference as well. An effective spot treatment generally has antimicrobial/anti inflammatory properties. \n\n  *Spot Treatments to Consider*\n\n  ~ Benzoyl Peroxide cream/wash:  If in a wash, leave on skin for a few minutes before cleansing off to allow the BP to take effect. Side effects can be dryness/redness sensitivity. [2.5%](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1j4l9o/just_want_to_share_what_my_doctor_told_me_today/cbb2fen) is also A-OK to use, and can be just as effective as the higher concentrations with just less irritation.\n\n  ~ Sulfur ointment/cream: Tends to be less irritating than BP\n\n  ~ Tea Tree Oil: Should be diluted with a carrier oil to avoid a chemical burn. Avoid if prone to allergic contact dermatitis. Potent fragrance.\n\n  ~ Neem Oil: Very potent fragrance \n\n  ~ Clay masks: These will help clear pores and help bring some acne to a head.    Bentonite is the strongest, not great for dry/very sensitive skin, and should be mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV).   Kaolin/Rhassoul/French green are less drying and do not need to be mixed with ACV.\n__________________________________________________________\n\n**Order of Products**\n\nAs far as the order of your new and snazzy routine goes, it really depends, which is partly why we didn't include anything specific on here. \n\nThere's also a lot of flexibility in how/when you can use things (more pertaining to hydroxy acids).  Some people use multiple hydroxy acids (some in the form of a liquid) and/or have RX products that they need to use, so depending on the situation, the order and how often to apply things will differ. \n\nAn *example* routine with all of the things listed could go:\n\n**AM**\n\n-  Splash with water (unless feeling really grimy, use your cleanser)\n- Moisturizer\n- Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n- (If applicable) Remove makeup, preferably with an oil\n- Cleanser\n- Exfoliator\n- Wait a few minutes, at least til it dries\n- Moisturizer\n- Spot treatment (also can come before moisturizer, *do whatever works for you*)\n\nAgain, this is JUST an example, and not etched in stone. It all depends what other things you're using and whether or not you need to tweak order of things, or increase or decrease usage of products.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions or leave some more product recs!",

I picked up the Cerave cream, and applied it 'liberally' like it says on the package the first time. Turned me into a greasy sweaty mess. The next day I applied it much thinner, just a pea-sized amount or so, and it was still a little greasy. This morning I applied about half that amount and it finally felt good, but I'm wondering if that's enough to even be effective.\n\n2. Should I apply the Cerave everywhere? My nose is the only part of my face that really gets oily - does it still need to be moisturized? What about under my eyes? I've seen mentions here and there that you don't actually need a specialized undereye cream, but I'm kind of paranoid from years of hearing that regular moisturizer will destroy my eye region and make me look like a crone within weeks.\n\n3. Sunscreen - does it go under or over the moisturizer? Either way, how long should I wait between products?\n\nThank you so much for this beginner guide!",

And sorry if you already answered this question, there's a lot of comments so I may have missed something:\n\nEverything I've read says to apply treatment products before moisturizer, allowing it to dry in between. My problem is that I have really dry skin, and I find that my moisturizer is more effective if I apply it when my skin is still slightly damp. My current night routine is to pre-cleanse with jojoba to dissolve makeup, wash with cetaphil gentle cleanser, moisturize, allow that to dry and THEN apply neutrogena hydrating acne treatment gel (2% SA).\nThis routine has been great as far as keeping my skin moisturized and flake free, but I'm worried the BHA isn't working as effectively as it could to keep my pores unclogged. Since SA is oil soluble my theory is that it can still penetrate through the moisturizer but maybe I'm totally wrong about this.\n\nso my question is, is it worth it to moisturize while my skin is still damp or does moisturizing first reduce the effectiveness of the BHA too much?\n\n*edit for clarity",

I'd appreciate any feedback!  :)\n\nOk, so from what I've gathered, my skin type is sensitive, acne prone combo (it's oily in the T-Zone and dry everywhere else) and I have adult onset hormonal acne.  It means that the worst of my acne actually doesn't pop up in the oily areas, but instead along my jaw/cheeks/behind my ears.  I'm proscribed Spironolactone, which has cleared up the major papules, but I do still have quite a number of whiteheads. \n\nI've tested the Cerave Foaming cleanser and the Cerave in the tub for over a month at this point.  I really liked the way that my skin felt with them, but my skin gets tight after cleansing.  It does feel fine after I moisturize though.  So, does this mean it's too harsh?  I'm still a bit confused as to whether the tightness is expected before moisturizing?  \n\nNow that I've had a month of testing the products and know that they don't cause problems, I want to start introducing a chemical exfoliant as well.  I'm hoping this will help with the whiteheads I have.\n\nFrom my understanding, BHAs like Stridex are great for acne prone skin, but I'm also worried about the effects they have on sensitive skin.  Additionally - since my acne is hormonal will these even really affect it, other than to potentially damage healthy skin and re-aggrivate it?  Or am I not understanding hormonal acne?  Would I be better to start with lactic acid because of that gentleness?\n\nThanks in advance for any responses and opinions!

        "body": "Hello all, I'm very new to this subreddit and reddit in general. My acne was kind of bad in high school, but I thought it was cool to not care about my skin and I popped pimples often and didn't have any skincare routine. My parents did have me go to a dermatologist because they did care though. I don't think the dude knew what he was doing and despite trying some pills for a while I stopped taking those. I still use the BP and Differin now but at that time it's all I used.\n\nAnyway, I'm a junior in college now and for the most part I don't get that bad of acne anymore. Sometimes I'll wake up with 3-4 new pimples but usually it'll be just something small every day or two. I want to finish it completely though. My forehead is generally clean except for a few bumps near the eyebrows and above the nose. My cheeks don't often get new ones but this is where most of the redness and scarring is. New pimples mainly form around the jawline, sideburn area, and around the mouth (although since a few changes since discovering this two weeks ago, my chin has been great).\n\nI would like to continue the progress I've made, keep the new ones from forming (especially because I need to start shaving more often but I'm really scared to cause a breakout), and also get rid of the redness. I really think I'm still doing something wrong. My face looks like I have a bad sunglasses tanline and I want to eliminate that redness and start lightening the scarring because the scars have been there for a couple years and haven't significantly reduced in redness, although there still are occasional pimples in that area.\n\nMy routine is this: \nAM \n*Rinse with water \n*Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser (Began using a week or so ago from Clean and Clear Deep Action Cream Cleanser after reading here not to use products with alcohol in them. That seems to have helped as I haven't broken out this week.) \n*Prescription BP of 5% (Causes some flaking around the chin and mouth. Used to be much worse before I started using moisturizer and I would shave off the dead skin. It goes away after moisturizing though.) *Wait 15-20 minutes\n*CVS brand (comparable to Cetaphil) Moisturizing Lotion (I think I'm going to switch this out too, but I read here also to do one product at a time.)\nPM: \n*In shower\n*Same Fresh Foaming Cleanser from above. (On Saturday I use Clean and Clear Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub. I read not to exfoliate too often, I would do it more if it's recommended though. I've also only began this as of a week ago.) \n*Prescription Differin\n*Wait 15-20 minutes\n*Same moisturizer\n\nNotes: \n*I resumed taking Zinc supplements a week ago after stopping for 2 months \n*I never really use sunscreen on my face for fear of clogging pores/breaking out \n*My face generally gets greasy, on my cheeks especially, anywhere from 3-8 hours after washing. Sometimes I wake up with a greasy face and sometimes I don't. What's up with this? \n*I pat dry my face with a new paper towel after each wash to avoid irritation and using towels that touch other things. \n*I never really touch my face, I'm very conscious about it.\n\nSummary of questions: \n*How can I reduce the redness and not breakout?! (I've even been asked if I'm sunburned. That's gotta stop.) \n*How can I finish off the pimples that still form? \n*What should be corrected in my routine? \n*How can I shave without breaking out or mistakenly running over a forming pimple?\n*What is recommended for spot treatments of pimples that I notice forming?\n\nThanks!",

I rarely use acids anymore and have noticed a significant reduction of acne and dryness.

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

I had the box of tea for a year prior to that and barely used it because I didn't have faith that it would do anything. However, I had a really bad UTI this past October and was tired of drinking water so I decided to put the spearmint tea method to the test, kill two birds with one stone. I drank it every day for about a week and my skin cleared up completely. I really wish I had started earlier. I tried everything, tretnoin (still using that), panoxyl, salicylic acid (which made it worse), and a myriad of other things, which I eventually stopped all of because I was worried I was doing too much to my face (which I definitely was at some points, my barrier was broken a few times, which needed a reset). It not only got rid of my cystic acne, it also got rid of the constant closed comedones along my jawline and around my mouth. When I washed my face before, it felt so bumpy, and now it's been super smooth for months. Before I felt like I couldn't use any new facial products I was interested in, moisturizers especially because they would break me out, but it turns out it was a hormonal problem, which I suspected from how I was generally feeling and the location of the breakouts. It also started happening basically around 28, I'm 31 now, so I thought that it might be due to changes in my hormones. So grateful for reddit for providing me with such great skincare resources and tips, I wouldn't have tried spearmint otherwise. ",

    "body": "amidst of all the costly products and brands that I use, a substantial amount of products in my routine are indian pharmacy grade and are just so gooodddd for the price point (also cuz my 17 yr old ass is broke duh!). all of them are under 500 so if you're low on budget and your skin type suits it, then do give these a try!\n\nill not be mentioning prescription products in this list. some of them have been suggested by my dermat but rest assured, I made sure all of them are OTC and do not require specific prescription, so you can get them easily! purchase status and ratings mentioned alongside.\n\nlets goooo\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w5vydp9jf9e91.jpg?width=496&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25bdc6beb08335f25119acba69c230b688abfb60\n\n**preliminary info**\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated, acne prone and dull\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads, blemishes and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**🐹Kojic cream**\n\n**pharma** : curatio\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 350 for 20g (available on discount at 1 mg)\n\nprobably one of the best beginner creams for those who want to give kojic acid a try. although there are creams which have less than 1% of kojic acid (this one has 2%), I think this works much better and than low conc. ones. also has PAD and lactokine so ideal for sensitive and acne prone skin too. need a little amount to spread it and doesn't feel greasy or oily. this has helped my PIH so much! albeit takes a little while to show, but with continuous use for almost 3 months, there is such a significant difference. also mildly exfoliates and is great for everyday use. post acne marks are so much lighter after use. also used it lighten my under eyes (diluted with moisturizer) and they look bright and healthy now! a really versatile cream with multiple uses. gold standard for beginner friendly hyperpigmentation fix! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **clearz plus**\n\n**pharma** : Dr. Reddy's\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 200 for 15gm\n\nI swear, almost half of the products on this list are related to PIH lmao. but then again, neither k-beauty nor indian cosmeceuticals have ever worked for PIH for me 😭 but anyway, this is a great multi-ingredient product! has 2% kojic acid and 2% vitamin c so it fixes PIH and gives a glow simultaneously! my lazy ass cant bother to apply vit-c in the morning so this has helped out a lot. and the best part it, its matte! so for my oily queens who want a glow and get rid of spots , this ones for you. so hydrating at the same time and not irritating at all. I use this in the morning, alternating with the previously mentioned cream.  and the 15gm tube actually lasts for a while (about 2 months) since the you don't require that much for one application. if you feel the percentage is too much, they also have a clearz version with 0.75% kojic, but I haven't tried it. again another golden standard for PIH! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **Kozimax skin lightening cream**\n\n**pharma** : Ethicare\n\nMrp : Rs. 320 for 15gm . also available in 9gm.\n\nok I swear this is the last kojic acid product on the list lol. this one is a lot more stronger than the other two and I've only used it after building a good tolerance to kojic acid as a whole. has 5% kojic acid, 10% vitamin c , glabridin (knew nothing about this until I got this product), arbutin and octinoxate, which makes it suitable for morning use. despite the name, yall, this was mind-blowing 🤯. results right after 3-4 uses. this was the hidden gem all along 🥲 glabridin was something that intrigued me the most, since its a UV filter and its anti-inflammatory so that a bonus! it didn't aggravate my active acne although I would suggest this only after you have some prior experience with kojic acid. directly using 5% might cause irritation. deffo a staple for my PIH! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **sebogel**\n\n**pharma** : Ethicare\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 240 for 30gm\n\nholy shit! I didn't know this had 6% niacinamide and it dried me the fuck out. but its an absolute HG for pimples that come out like 'surprise motherfucker' lol. the best and fast-acting spot treatment I've ever come across. it also works amazingly for enlarged pores and excess oil product and is also good for contact therapy. didn't really see a difference in blackheads or sebaceous filaments but I think with constant use, the benefits will come in much better. this so much more effective than any other salicylic acid serum I've ever tried. just dries me out a lot . **WRP (4/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **hyalugel plus**\n\n**pharma** : Ethicare\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 350 for 30gm\n\ngot this rec from the sub itself! and it didn't disappoint! I will say the tube packaging made the product end faster since I drench my skin in hyaluronic acid day and night lmao. but this leaves my skin so plump and juicy 🥵. its like someone packed the SNP peptaronic toner and isntree HA plus in a gel base and sold it for cheaper! although none of the HA serums I've used have disappointed me (only one of them has) , this one is such an affordable and easy to get option. one thing is though, it seriously causes the worst dryness if not used on damp skin. still if used properly, this is a boon for all my dehydrated and dry sisters/brothers out there! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **Zitmoist gel**\n\n**pharma** : Canixa Life Sciences\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 350 for 50gm ( available on discount on 1mg)\n\noh.my.god. the best summer gel moisturizer for dry skin?!? although its marketed for oily acne-prone skin , I believe this will work for all skin types. man , such a simple ingredients list and none o them aggravate my acne at all. has allantoin and sodium hyaluronate in aloe vera gel base (in contrast to what their website says. it does not have niacinamide or vitamin e). gives such a good matte finish without drying my skin. deffo suitable for oily skin throughout the year but only in summers for dry ones. this wont do much in the winters. also has a very refreshing and light scent to it although there is no added fragrance! **WRP for summers (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **Demelan Cream**\n\n**pharma** : Glenmark\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 415 for 20gm (available on discount at 1mg)\n\nthis one is pretty good for extremely textured skin types! has a really high conc. of glycolic acid (10%) and also has arbutin and kojic acid pre-mixed. although it did break me out a bit (aha/glycolic cream forms tend to do that more as compared to serums and toners) it helped me out more in body texture as compared to on the face lol. I have extremely rough ankles and knees and this soften them up real quick along with lacsoft! not to mention, it gives good odor control when used on armpits along with lightening those areas aswell. not sure whether ill use it again on my face tho . **MRP (3/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**🐹 Cerasoft imf**\n\n**pharma** : Grace Derma Healthcare\n\n**Mrp**: Rs.300 for 100gm\n\njumping on the cerasoft whore train with u/Someonesometh1ng lmao. probably the best pharma barrier repair/ dry skin/ atopic skin/bajra roti skin cream ever to exist imo. cuz damn this slaps as hell 🥵 has ceramides, pentavin, HA and other good shit. seriously at par with bioderma baume for me. a bit heavy and greasy for morning summer use for me but this along with aveeno dermexa are probably going to be my favs for winter mornings! nothing but one of my HGs for sure! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's it! hope this was helpful 🥰 I had more recs but I either used them a long time ago or they just didn't work for me. maybe ill make another post later but that's it for now!",

    "body": "I don't know if I'm alone in this situation, but I never learned how to take care of myself. I moisturized my skin after a shower maybe 5 times in my life before I went to college. I washed my face with harsh cleansers and then wondered why my skin was dry. I let my nails grow out long and my cuticles got ugly and hang nails that were more like hang-cuticles were a regular occurrence in my life. I learned to put on makeup at 15 so I seemed somewhat put together but honestly it was all just a a poorly painted illusion. \n\nI feel a lil cheated because isn't my mom supposed to teach me these things? The only thing she taught me about shaving was to be careful not to cut myself and she told me I should put cream on after a shower like once, but never elaborated. She never told me I should probably blow dry my hair because the \"natural waves\" I'd get when I didn't brush my hair while letting it air dry wasn't a look you strive for. Also it made a knot in the back of my hair that I'd always miss and my hair dresser would find. \n\nSo imagine my shock when I plopped myself in an all women's college and saw that my self care routine was sorely lacking. I wasn't necessarily gross or stinky--I showered every day and wore deodorant. I had caught the 'brush your hair' memo. I washed my face too. But I didn't use shower gel...I thought water was enough to clean myself. Exfoliation was a foreign concept and I figured it was cool to skip flossing. \n\nThankfully being in an all girls school you pick up a few things to make yourself fit in. Then you get curious and research a few things. You wanna make sure you're doing this new stuff right, and along the way find out the things you thought you'd been doing right, you've been doing wrong all your life. Like the fact pantene is actually bad for your hair and your face shouldn't feel tight after you wash it. I wish I'd been told these things, but no one thinks to tell you stuff that's basically common knowledge. \n\nI'm doing better now. I've seemed to catch on to a lot of this self care stuff, and honestly I feel a lot better. If I can feel a lot better doing these things, I'm sure some of you can too. So I thought I'd make a self care list for those of you like me, who were never taught how to take care of themselves. It's the least that I can do.\n\nKeep in mind, these are tips that work for me, a blonde white girl with thick hair and eczema. What works for me may not work for you. This list is by no means all inclusive. Also, a lot of this will be common sense, but it's stuff I didn't know. So I'm hoping I can help at least one of you with this information :) \n\n**Hair**\n\n* Avoid shampoos and conditioners with sulfates and silicons. These can damage hair and hinder growth. More info [here](http://sulfatefreeshampoos.org/why-are-sulfates-bad-for-hair/) and [here](http://www.thecoveteur.com/2015/10/06/silicone-hair-products/)\n\n* Don't detangle hair with brush while it is wet. Instead use a wide toothed comb. If your hair is thick and tangles easily, use the comb while letting your conditioner soak\n\n* That's another thing. In order to get maximum use of your conditioner, let it soak for a minute or two before rinsing it out. I use this time to wash my body. \n\n* Boar bristle brushes are gentler on your hair and help distribute your hairs natural oils. However if you have thicker hair boar bristle brushes alone won't detangle. I suggest using in conjunction with a gentle regular bristled brush. \n\n* Washing every day strips your hair of oils and in the end makes your hair more oily. Try to extend periods in between washes. Dry shampoo is your best friend while your oil production adjusts.\n\n* Air dry your hair if you can. If you can't, use a heat protectant on your hair. \n\n* Using a hair mask once a week can do wonders for you hair texture. I highly recommend it. \n\n* Using a clarifying shampoo once a week can help remove product buildup. \n\n* for more, visit /r/haircarescience\n\n**Skin**\n\n* Always, always, *always* patch test a product. It's tempting to slather a new skin care product all over your face but you're risking a reaction that may break you out, or worse, an allergic reaction. \n\n* If your skin feels tight after washing, your facial soap is too harsh.\n\n* Salicylic Acid and other chemical exfoliators are barely effective in soaps that you wash off. They must be applied and left on the skin for a period of time (always follow the instructions on the package!)\n\n* Moisturizer won't break you out! Don't be afraid of moisturizer. So many girls I know avoid it because they think it makes their skin oily. It doesn't. Not moisturizing your skin makes your skin produce more oil to compensate. \n\n* If you can, see a dermatologist. \n\n* Does anyone have any tips for dry feet? I've tried physical exfoliation and intense moisturizer and they're still stubbornly dry. That's one thing I haven't figured out. \n\n* Moisturize after every shower for smooth, soft, touchable skin. I can't believe it took me 18 years to figure that one out.\n\n* While pumice does jack shit for feet, it works wonders on dry elbows. Just be gentle/don't rub them raw. \n\n* A shower poof gently exfoliates while washing. If you need to exfoliate deeper, those exfoliator gloves work very well. \n\n* Exfoliate physically before shaving for a smoother shave. I use a gentle oatmeal scrub by st. ives. You may need something stronger.\n\n* Don't forget to use chapstick nightly and in the morning to avoid chapped lips. Personally, EOS is one of the only chapsticks that doesn't dry out my lips if I don't continuously reapply.  \n\n* Wear sunscreen as often as you can! Not only does it prevent painful burns and harmful UV damage, but it prevents aging as well.\n\n* For more, check /r/skincareaddiction\n\n**Teeth**\n\n* Floss. I know it sucks but it makes your teeth whiter and your breath fresher and you won't have crap stuck in your teeth. Not to mention it prevents cavities. In the end, it's worth it. \n\n* If you have trouble flossing due to a permanent retainer, use those brush picks for the bottoms of your teeth. They're miracle workers. \n\n* Mouth wash is just an extra step to preventing cavities, and it makes your breath fresher. \n\n**Misc**\n\n* Take a multi-vitamin! It makes your nails stronger and your hair healthier and you'll generally feel better.\n\n* Use cuticle cream regularly so your cuticles aren't painfully damaged.\n\n* Try to remember to clip your nails. I often forget and they turn into claws. Also, use a strengthening product on them to prevent breakage. \n\n* Drink lots of water a day. At least 8 8oz glasses. This not only keeps you healthy and functioning, but it helps clear up skin and speeds up your metabolism. \n\n* Don't use soap to wash your vagina. It messes up the Ph and can lead to a yeast infection. I like detachable shower heads, because I can use them as a makeshift bidet. Otherwise just use water and your hands or a washcloth. \n\n\n\nI'd like everyone else to share their basic self care tips :) Let's all help another out, especially those of us who didn't learn it growing up.

(edited to format)\n\nOk, Here's what you do: \n\n* Exfoliate, then rub the area with baby oil before you shave to soften the hair and skin. \n\n* Shave using a men's razor (one with four blades) and men's moisturizing shaving cream. Since they are made for faces, they are extra gentle. \n\n* Dab some rubbing alcohol on the skin after you shave to kill bacteria and close your pores. \n\n* Then apply deodorant (an unscented Dove stick works best) liberally. This will keep you dry down there so you won't chafe and prevents razor bumps. You will have the smoothest giney ever. \n\nMine was always flawless, I was a dancer for four years and did this almost daily. I posted this same routine under my old account and I got TONS of messages in my inbox with girls thanking me for their blemish-free pies.",

Instead you can buy 'gentle' mouthwash which don't have alcohol but are still good for your mouth health.  It's pH not Ph.\n\nI'd add - get regular cervical smear and STI tests and regular mole-checks.  On that note, sunscreen is your friend and you should wear it everyday.

Mornings are finally getting ingrained but evenings not quite.  It helps when you're standing there, feeling like you forgot something but can't quite think what.

You should make it without flavor, which can dry out your lips. If something's drying out your lips, it indicates an allergic reaction. The recipe I use is one I found on /r/skincareaddiction and it's super simple. Melt 1 part beeswax with 1 part hard oil/butter (coconut or shea works well), then add 2 parts liquid oil (such as almond, apricot, grapeseed, etc). For 10 chapstick tubes, 1 part is about 3 teaspoons.\n\nIt's also worth noting that taking a vitamin supplement is not good for everyone to do. The supplement industry is largely unregulated and there have been reports of contaminants. So anyone with potentially fatal allergies should avoid them like the plague. Some supplements are even contaminated with prescription drugs, so anyone taking blood pressure medications or medications that tend to react with other medications or have a high potential for overdose should also avoid supplements.",

I don’t like going through 2 3 bottles of a serum to see someee improvement. Their results are slower than female orgasm.\n\nThere are so so so many stories of fungus, crystallisation, falsified claims in this sub’s hall of shame. Almost everytime, the customer has been gaslighted. I will never forget how dermaco literally shamed and doxxed the customer in front of their entire Instagram audience.\n\nThat brings me to an another major issue.. their customer service is worst than the ektarfa pyaar I had in 8th grade. No replies, no resolutions…just gaslighting. I’ve read instances where in the customer support did indeed help out so it’s a good thing that they might be changing.\n\nI am ready for all the downvotes in the world but if any brand is lurking here and works on even one of the complaints here..it’ll be worth it.\n \nI know that these brands are kinda new but that doesn’t give them the pass to take us for a ride. So, I do cut them some slack by not buying their products.\n\n-yours sincerely,\n\nA customer who is tired of waiting for international brands to come here so really wants the Indian ones to do well.\n\nEdit: I LOVE INDIAN PHARMACY BRANDS. My skincare is full of it! I am not some elitist Karan Johar who’s putting down these brands just because they’re Indian and NOT AT ALL do I say that Asian beauty and Western brands are some Bhagwan ki den on earth. But atleast most of them are well researched and tested and not just bombarding us with paid reviews and paid promotions. A USER IN THE COMMENTS FOUND A FCKIN DEAD BUG IN THEIR LOTION AND BRAND IGNORED ALLLL THEIR MAILS.\n\nI ALSO KNOW THAT TOPICAL SKINCARE IS NOT MAGGI TO SHOW RESULTS IN 2 MINS. But tell me, no results after using a serum for 3 4 months? How is that justified? Isn’t it just expensive water then?",

When a product is good, it'll speak for itself(Eg: Search on the tretinoin sub and see how many people are talking about our Indian brand Menarini). Also the indie products are not free, we are paying good money to buy them and our face is not an experimental tool for patriotism.

But I only have bad experiences till now so no thank you. \n\nAnd before anyone says this is west-worshipping, no it isn't. Quality skincare is not limited to the west, korean  skincare is even better. Also, **Indian pharmas** are the beast. So effective and affordable! Like you can see the results they give visibly. Unlike them, Indian brands have a long LONG way to go.\n\nEdit: A routine I plan to incorporate for my fungal-acne prone skin is- Simple face wash, Labmuffin diy vitamin c serum using hollywood secrets lascorbic acid powder, sebamed gel moisturizer, Re'equil blue sunscreen and in the night instead of vit c, sandwich technique with Tretinoin followed by a few drops of MCT oil to seal the moisture in.\nI used Dr.Sheth's Amla and vit c face wash *once* and could feel some flare up in my fungal acne.

I can sweat, I can exercise, I can get hot without worrying. Only once every couple of months when I get hot I get slight CU tingles, like a gentle reminder of how excruciating this used to be.\n\nI wanted to come back and highlight the most important result from those literature reviews back then: **CU usually clears on its own.** We are the extreme cases, and with that comes extreme suffering. But despite that, most likely, most cases of CU clears on its own. This is why this subreddit doesn't keep growing a lot. This is why many posters eventually become silent. Their CU clears, and they can move on, living normal, happy lives.\n\n**Most likely, you'll be okay. Stay strong.**\n\n----------\n\nOriginal post:\n\nMolecular biology student here - and sufferer of cholinergic urticaria. Here are some pet theories and theoretical treatments in clear language.\n\nI love to read and summarize papers in my spare time. My this year's literature list alone has been a wild ride of 1500+ theories, meta-analyses and clinical trials. And I happened to develop cholinergic urticaria this year as well. I hate it.\n\nSo, as I did for various other topics and papers, I went deep into the literature on cholinergic urticaria. By now it has been 100+ hours of reading and 100+ studies read.\n\nQuick summary: nobody really knows. There is no validated medical theory of why CU develops, at all. And no treatment that really works. We all have tried antihistamines; I envy the lucky ones for whom they actually work well.\n\n**Quick overview of this post:**\n\n1. **Introduction (right here)**\n2. **Theories of what causes CU**\n3. **Possible cures for CU**\n4. **The links to my sources and my full analysis**\n\n**My theories of what causes cholinergic urticaria**\n\nI developed these theories via modifying current theories of the pathology of CU or via creating my own theories or hybrids. They are all based on studies done in CU patients. They may apply to us all. For both of them there is good evidence, but they could be disproven or insufficient. Good old science.\n\nThese are quick descriptions of how the theories work. I link my detailed write-up and the sources below.\n\n*Prelude: How sweating works*\n\nSweating in healthy humans is induced via the hypothalamus sensing high body temperatures, and then sending neural signals via sympathetic nerves to the skin's sweat glands. These nerves are cholinergic (they use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) and the receptors on sweat glands are called muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Acetylcholine released by neurons in the vicinity of a sweat gland binds to its receptors and stimulates sweating. The sweat is produced in the sweat gland within the skin and brought to the skin surface with rather long, thin, hollow ducts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcnkpel6u1261.png?width=396&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6584f5b97f4389e0a2556b227866ad2c30d1533\n\n# Hypothesis 1: Poral Occlusion Theory\n\nBasically, the long ducts of your sweat glands that should bring sweat to the surface may be occluded due to keratin plugs or unknown goo.\n\nSweat gland duct occlusion leads to accumulation, rupture and spillover of sweat in the dermis, causing inflammation, pain & weals due to the various inflammatory substances contained in normal human sweat which is meant to be outside of the body. The reaction to the intradermal sweat may be exacerbated due to autoimmune anti-sweat-IgE antibodies and sweat hypersensitivity.\n\nThe keratin plugs may happen due to low skin turnover, bacteria on your skin producing goo or keratin hyper-synthesis - the ultimate cause is unclear as of now.\n\nScientific support: In a nutshell, there have quite a few cases where researchers clearly found these plugs. Especially so in CU patients which present with hypohidrosis (low sweating). But these plugs have not always been found, and it is yet debated. But Poral Occlusion Theory offers an elegant and simple theory of why cholinergic urticaria forms. It may be a sub-form of CU which not everybody has.\n\nThis theory gives us a ton of theoretical options to treat CU. See below!\n\n# Hypothesis 2: Few Receptor Theory\n\nAcetylcholine is released by sympathetic nerves stimulated via the hypothalamus' response to high temperature, like in any non-symptomatic individual. Because of low muscarinic receptor expression at the sweat glands, the hypothalamus' signal intensifies (there is no temperature decrease) and the quantity of acetylcholine in the area of a sweat gland increases. As mast cells also express muscarinic receptors, high local cholinergic activity eventually leads to their degranulation, causing inflammation, pain & weals. Pain is also caused via the acetylcholine directly stimulating pain receptors.\n\nA quick graphic:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8lknfzku1261.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b8a2116075deeae0e165a537682a103d043bcf\n\nLow muscarinic receptor expression could be caused by low general fitness, as highly fit humans sweat more readily and easily. However, there appear to be no studies on how exercise affects muscarinic receptors.\n\nIn turn, the cause may not be low sweat gland receptors numbers but high mast cell muscarinic receptor expression, making them vulnerable to degranulation & weal formation even at low local acetylcholine levels.\n\nThe current evidence strongly points at there being too few receptors in various cases of CU. They all have significantly fewer receptors on their sweat glands than health individuals have, making proper sweating very hard.\n\n**Maybe both are right?**\n\nWe are highly complex biological machines: It is likely that both theories are able to explain some parts of the process leading to CU.\n\n# Hypothesis 1 + 2: A synthesis\n\nSynthesis: Both 1 and 2 happen simultaneously. There is duct occlusion leading to both significant sweat spillover as well as acetylcholine spillover. Acetylcholine spillover directly stimulates pain nerves, while it degranulates mast cells too. Sweat, which is per se inflammatory if it isn't outside the body, and mast cell degranulation cause the weal and inflammation. This could also explains the common sweat sensitivity seen in CU: The body develops antibodies targeted at the sweat within the skin, as it should not be there.\n\nThere are only a few papers providing any attempt at a complete theory of cholinergic urticaria. This would explain the lack of current medical knowledge about CU in the scientific community..\n\n**Some other factors that may be involved in causing cholinergic and other chronic urticarias:**\n\n* Sweat sensitivity is often involved. I would argue it is rather a consequence of CU than a major true cause of it.\n* Hypothyroidism may be involved. There are several cases of urticaria associated with thyroid antibodies and low thyroid hormones.\n* Epstein-Barr or Herpes simplex virus infection may be involved. In some urticarias, medications against theses viruses were ably to completely alleviate symptoms.\n* Parasites may be involved. Think of these disgusting worms hanging in your small intestine.\n* Helicobacter pylori, a nasty gastrointestinal bacterium, may also cause some urticarias.\n\n**All my sources, all my studies, all my knowledge and further interesting things are summarized in my personal Knowledge Map.**\n\nFor more possible causes and how to recognize them, check out my Knowledge Map:In research (to the right) → Health → Human problems → Cholinergic urticaria\n\n[https://www.mindmeister.com/1649064493?t=VWsYHQvRwS](https://www.mindmeister.com/1649064493?t=VWsYHQvRwS)\n\n# The search for the cure\n\nNow that we actually have a track of what may cause CU, there are quite a few options to try. These are just some I thought of - please let me know if you know of others that either decrease poral occlusion or increase muscarinic receptors!\n\nRemember, these are mostly theoretical!\n\n**Keratolytic creams.**\n\nIf there actually are poral plugs involved, keratolytics may be able to take care of them. Examples are:\n\n* Urea cream - really keratolytic at 20% or more\n* Salicylic acid creams - commonly used in beauty face masks\n* Glycolic acid, lactic acid, retinoic acid creams\n* General skin lotions: The plugs may also form due to simple and plain skin dryness. This may explain why in some CU cases, winter (drier skin) hits harder than summer ever could.\n\nFor some of these, I have already heard reports of them helping in CU.\n\n**Increase your muscarinic receptors.**\n\nThis one is harder - there are no clear treatments we can put onto skin and *swoosh* there are more receptors. But there are some possible candidates:\n\n* Exercise. Athletes sweat more easily - possibly due to higher muscarinic acetylcholine receptors? We don't know. But it is worth a try. And it would explain why \"sweat therapy\" works for so many in this sub.\n* Choline rich diets. Choline rich diets may - counter-intuitively - increase the number of acetylcholine receptors. Choline rich foods are eggs, beef, chicken, kidney beans, etc. (See my Map for more)\n* Choline supplementation. Choline is also easily available as a supplement. They do that over at r/Nootropics a lot.\n\nOnce again: These are just the ones I found worthy to put into this post. On the Map, I noted \\~30 other inventions which may alleviate CU: [https://www.mindmeister.com/1649064493?t=VWsYHQvRwS](https://www.mindmeister.com/1649064493?t=VWsYHQvRwS)\n\nThe main problem is, these are theoretical. No researcher was interested enough or found enough funding to test these in a randomized controlled clinical trial.\n\n**But as all these interventions are pretty safe if done properly and pose low risks, we are free to try them. And - imagine if one of these actually cures your CU.**\n\nI am on my way to try all of them. But I need your help too.\n\nGo test yourself for hypothyroidism, for thyroid antibodies, for parasites, for helicobacter pylori, etc. Go and experiment - science it at your disposal.\n\nAnd for the sake of the community, please report back.\n\nAnd at last, most easily: If you have read anything that may my reading, if you know some studies to send me: Please do so. I am fallible, and appreciate any proper evidence-based feedback.",

The pain and prickly feeling is not a simple “itch” that doctors say it is. It feels like a million ants biting you all over the place. The worst part is that when you get it, it itches then you get more stressed so it itches more. This shit is crazy! \n\n\nI just wanted to say that my CU peaked right after quarantine started. When everything shut down and nothing was open. I believe it is because I stopped playing soccer and exercising as much as i used too, meaning I sweat less. This made my CU a lot worse and caused a shit ton of acne on my face. Now that things are back open (at least for the most part) my CU got a little better but it still hurts the same. Knowing that this can last for over 20 years is the scariest part. I had it for about 4-5 years without realizing what it was until around 2 years ago. I also want to add that during the winter of last year in January I went up to Big Bear Mountain to go snowboarding. I was worried I would itch the whole time up there because it was pretty warm and I would sweat, however I felt nothing. Everything seemed perfectly normal and I felt no symptoms whatsoever. This is really weird to me because when I came back home 3 days later my Cholinergic Urticaria came back as well...  No one thinks that CU is bad but it definitely needs more attention to it.

I wanted to report some of the stuff you mentioned as someone who’s suffered from this. \nI had hyperthyroidism when CU started in June/July of this year. But, my dosage was all over the place for last year. My thyroid isn’t active anymore - radioactive iodine several years ago as a treatment for Graves Disease. So you might have a good idea with thyroid disorders and this. \n\nAnother thing, and I don’t know how exactly to explain it but the drug topamax has been seen to cause CU or just general urticaria. I was on this for close to a year but my doctor increased my dosage about two/three months before my first breakout of CU.  From the little research I did on it, topamax can effect sweat glands - which could line up with Hypothesis one you listed. \n\nNow that my thyroid levels (including antibodies) are back in the normal range, my CU has also gone down. Now, I have been doing sweat therapy every other day for the last two weeks so I’m not sure if that’s a factor because I noticed the CU going down before I started sweat therapy. \nJust my two cents. I’m not a scientist so idk how valid my comment is, i just wanted to share my experience. \nBut this was great! I really appreciate you writing this up and sharing it with us.\n\n\nEdit: also want to add that shortly before starting sweat therapy, I also quit taking topamax.

I found this pretty interesting:\n\n\"In about half of patients with chronic idiopathic hives, the explanation is that body's immune system is, in a sense, overactive. The urticaria is \"autoimmune\". The immune system is attacking the normal tissues of the body and causing hives as a result. We know certain urticaria sufferers have other signs of autoimmune problems. Some have autoimmune thyroid disease, **vitiligo**, swollen joints, or certain abnormalities in the blood (especially the ANA test). A new treatment has recently emerged for autoimmune urticaria. This is the use of **hydroxychloroquine**, a drug originally used for malaria. In a clinical trial 83% improved or cleared completely when used for three months or more. \"  \n\n\nMy doctor mentioned I also have sweat rashes and explained that there could be something in my sweat causing the reactions on my skin.

Thought it was related to a new medicine I was on. \n\nSo, after avoiding exercise for months & basically crying through my 40th bday trip in Hawaii (because every hike or cool thing we did I was covered in hives & crawling out of my skin!!!), I cut the dose of the medicine in 1/2. Seemed to take care of the problem for about 6 months. I was able to workout, run, etc, no issues!!!\n\nNow I’m struggling again...whether I exercise at home outside if I get even slightly warm I begin to feel the CU coming on. Feels like itchy-pain all over. Makes me want to yell and cry at the same time. \n\nIt goes away with antihistamines and cooling down (so lucky there) but I’d like to prevent it. I don’t wanna be 1-hr into a hike in the middle of nature, start to sweat, feel like I need to turn back because of the CU, and feel stranded (yes, this has happened & it’s not pretty).\n\nI definitely have always had problems sweating- I’m not much of a sweater. Don’t know if it’s a buildup of this one medicine (even tho I’m now taking such a minimal dose), but likely just my body attacking itself & another morphing of the rare AI disease I have (Behcets Syndrome). \n\nAnyhow thanks for the support and for the info.",

I can only estimate because my memory from that time is rather clouded by medication bouts, but my mother has told me at least ten times by the time I was 8 years old. As a child, it's absolutely debilitating. My small size was absolutely a factor in how quickly my wheals would spread. The severity ranging from minor issues just living my life, to full body breakouts with wheal congregations dinner plate size and bigger. My entire back, legs, arms, everything. Swelling usually begins around my head and I can immediately tell when I am sick with anything, cold, flu, whatever, when my ears start to swell up.\n\nHowever, this did not entirely stop me from being physically active as a child or teenager, I was in soccer, marching band, and finally JROTC during my entire educational term. As I have grown, it does take longer for the condition to \"spread\" but once it begins, it lasts with great intensity for days, sometimes weeks.\n\nI have tried everything. Sweat therapy. Dietary changes. Lifestyle adjustments with my lotions, shampoos, soaps, everything. I keep my home exceptionally clean to avoid mold and bacterial build up. I don't even leave soap in a soap dish, I will set it on a hook in the sun. As for what medications? I can  list many. Zyrtec(when it was in liquid form until its pill form we know today), Claritin, Allegra, various histamine blockers, HTC, and Xolair, and the only thing that seems to help me process the issue are directly affecting antihistamines like Benadryl or Hydroxyzine and copious amounts of water to pass the histamines through my urine.\n\nAt around 22, I had another hospitalization that resulted in my beginning to work from home and various healthy habit changes, I was in a very well controlled state for almost 10 years, about a year and a half ago, after I received the Moderna vaccination, came out of remission with a vengeance. My usual methods of management are barely keeping it in check and I hope to go back into remission soon and I'm currently looking into immuno suppressant therapy based on a study by the APAACI group, an international organization for immunology and allergy studies, they have a lot of informative information available. As well as a recommendation from my current immunologist that, thank God, was versed in my condition before I visited.\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure how much my case information helps you but I do know this is all tied to my immune system in some way. Belsomra, a rather new sleep aid, directly affects the immune system and it has been the only sleep aid that has ever worked for me. I have tried everything and ambien between.\n\nGood luck with your study! I would like to see a day where there is a consistent treatment for everyone. No one should have to go through this.",

        "body": "Hello!\n\nJust wanted to start out by thanking you for all the time and effort you put into researching, compiling, and writing this post, and all the future work you plan to and will do. I also wanted to share a bit about my experience with my hives that I suspect is cholinergic urticaria, but as I am undiagnosed, I thought I'd mention this as a disclaimer of sorts just for good measure. My symptoms first started around two to three years ago when I was around 21 or 22 years old, and it flares up whenever my body temperature increases, so I've broken out while walking, exercising, when nervous, anxious, or scared, or even just from getting too excited while watching an action film. Usually, the burning, stinging pain occurs before the intense itching, followed by sweat, and there's always a patch of red, irritated skin at the location of the flare up. Sometimes, there is a noticeable, round wheal at the center of the patch and sometimes there is not. These red patches and wheals, once the itching subsides, fade away within the hour, although I'm noticing that following these events, small reddish bumps or scar-like dots are left behind, although this could just be because my skin scars very easily. My skin can scar from a very mild papercut. There also seems to be a period of time between starting to get warm and my symptoms but before I start sweating, although this period of time varies. I've also been able to sweat before the onset of symptoms, but this is rare and generally only happens when I first wake up in the morning. I have noticed that my hives take longer to appear in cold weather because it takes longer for my body temperature to seemingly reach that \"threshold\" at which symptoms begin. I've tried taking daily over-the-counter antihistamines for a couple months, but they didn't do anything as far as I could tell. I am currently trying salicylic acid body wash at 1% along with an exfoliating shower tool to see if my symptoms are caused by blocked pores and if they can be cleared. I am unable to make a conclusive report on how this affects my symptoms as I have only started testing this last week.\n\n  \nIt is worth noting, although it may seem completely unrelated, that I am FTM (female-to-male) transgender, and I have undergone a double mastectomy and am currently taking injectable testosterone as part of my hormone replacement therapy. Shortly after my double mastectomy, I began developing a chronic condition that resembled erythema nodosum on my ankles, shins, and thighs that lasted about three or four years. It was undiagnosed and untreated, although during the coarse of figuring out what they were last year, my PCP ran a blood test for antibodies, and my levels of ANA were abnormal. I have not since been able to see a rheumatologist for a followup on this test result. Additionally, my symptoms of CU began after about 8 months of my taking testosterone, and since I've been told that androgens can affect the skin, it might make some sense for CU to be in some way influenced by sex hormones. Many people who take testosterone have also developed CU, although not enough people to warrant its inclusion on the list of effects of testosterone given to patients on their informed consent for hormone replacement therapy. I have only anecdotal evidence thus far to go on in terms of the correlation between taking testosterone and the development of CU, but the occurrence of CU among FTM individuals is at least at a notable amount according to the internet. Also, although I am not diagnosed with any autoimmune or thyroid issues, I have a family history of thyroid issues, and my blood test indicates an autoimmune condition. Hoping you might find this information interesting.\n\n6-MONTH UPDATE: It seems like a reliable way to ease my symptoms is making myself sweat past the itching phase, although this must be consistently done every other day at the least or else symptoms start returning. The salicylic acid bodywash at 1% has helped with body acne noticeably as well as dampening the severity of my symptoms, although not enough to justify continuing to use it for that sole purpose. This very slight dampening of my symptoms did not start becoming apparent until around 3 months after I began bathing with this bodywash, used once a day, which makes sense when taking into account the time frame most dermatologists recommend using a new topical treatment to see if it works (also 3 months). These days, I tend to experience my symptoms less often, although that might be due to the weather getting gradually cooler or perhaps getting used to the 78-80°F temperature my family keeps the house. I have since switched bodywashes about 1 month ago to see if my symptoms get worse in an attempt to rule out acclimation.\n\nAdditionally, I have seen a rheumatologist, and all my blood work has come back in the normal range for all of the tests she ran, apart from the ANA. She also ordered chest x-rays to rule out tuberculosis on account of my shortness of breath that I sometimes experience. The x-rays have come back normal as well, and I have a follow-up appointment with her around the end of this month, October 2024, to discuss next steps. It seems likely that I do not have an autoimmune disorder.",

Acne has almost completely disappeared and reddening of the skin is almost gone. Wala na also itchy areas. I do have some texture issues I need to solve next but I am just so grateful and happy that my skin is doing so much better. \n\nA few changes I made after reading the comments (thank you for them! This is why I love Reddit): \n\n\\- Dr. Wong's Sulfur Soap with Aloe Moisturizer (white packaging) - from 2-3 minutes, I just use this to cleanse my face for less than a minute na in the morning and evening. I just use the soap bubbles and not the soap directly. \n\n\\- Dr. Sensitive Niacinamide + Salicylic Acid - as my daily moisturizer in the evening only. Used to do both AM & PM but considered to do only in the PM and what a game changer. No more itching in the AM (used to itch after layering this with my sunscreen). Will def repurchase!\n\n\\- Dr. Sensitive Sunscreen (not the tinted one!) - still as my sunscreen. This has Niacinamide so using this as my 2 in 1 moisturizer and sunscreen and so far so good! Will repurchase!\n\n\\- Still using as my shampoo and conditioner the 2 in 1 Selsun Blue Shampoo-Conditioner. I found it to be a bit drying so I only use a little bit on my roots. \n\nAm working on slowly incorporating my old skincare that worked for me (i.e Cerave moisturizer in the PM, Cosrx AHA/BHA and HN Serum in the AM) that can hopefully help with the texture and redness.

    "body": "For 15 years I have been struggling with acne. Sometimes it was mild, sometimes it became severe, and I tried everything. From oral antibiotics for months, birth control, Isotretinoin (Accutane), prescription creams, and endless OTC products from the pharmacy and drugstore (Retinol, Salicylic Acid, Azelaic Acid,..). The constant disappointments from trying different products, spending a lot of money, and not seing any improvements really sucks. \n\nIn retrospective, what was the most dangerous, was the advice on different diets. Becoming paranoid on all different ingredients, starting with diary, sugar, refined carbs, coffee, gluten,.. is really not fun. And not matter what I cut out for how long, it did not influence my skin at all.\n\nWhat I want to share is that since a couple of months my skin is clear. What did help in the end? I cannot say 100%, but I believe it was a combination of things. I was diagnosed with endometriosis and after surgery, I was advised by my doctor to start with birth control again, as this (currently) the only way to prevent endometriosis to come back. Taking a specific birth control for endometriosis helped my skin a lot and I would say it improved 60%. At this point I slowly integrated Differin into my routine, as I could finally tolerate the purging. I tried twice before to start, but stopped again. Now, after one year after my surgery, my acne scars are slowly disappearing and I am starting to feel like myself again :) I am trying to keep my routine as simple as possible, because I am too afraid to irritate my skin (and nothing worked in the past..)\n\nROUTINE PM: CeraVe Cleanser, Differin, CeraVe Moisturiser\nROUTINE AM: washing my face with water, Beauty of Joseon Sun Relief SPF 50 (highly recommend), Missha perfect cover BB cream SPF 42 (high coverage, recommend!!)\n\nRemember that acne is temporary, and try to not let it stop you from what you want to do!",

He also prescribed me a topical 40% salicylic acid to apply directly onto the wart every second day, and cover with tape after. \n\nIt became  painful lesion and I couldn’t walk on it well the next few days after. It was so painful! \n\n3-7 days after the pain died down and it was more manageable, I still couldn’t walk with my foot flat on the floor - have been walking on the side of my foot lol\n\n7-10 days later I am adapting to walking on it better again. I put duct tape on it today and this is what happened when I peeled the duct tape off…. \n\nI also tried to pop the blister underneath to see what would happen, but turned out all this brown paste came up instead! \nI gently pressed until it finished coming up. \nBut does anyone know what this gunk is? Is it the wart itself? Or is it something else \n\nThanks \nHope this is almost over! I’m due to go back to the podiatrist tomorrow to check up with it.",

He said to leave the treatment on for 24 hours; eventually the area will turn black and eventually the wart will fall off. He said to not use anymore duct tape, and to just use band aid or paper tape. He said to continue the topical 60% salicylic acid, but only a thin layer. \nAnd I will go back for another appointment in a few weeks. ✌️",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?

AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

Some people see this as a deterrent, but I see it as an opprotunity to get other things done. (Seriously, I floss more now than I ever have in my life) \n\n1. Floss\n2. Whiten your teeth \n3. Take progress photos\n4. Moisturize your body\n5. Clean your make-up brushes\n6. Take the dog for a walk (preferably at night)\n7. Take the trash out (again, preferably at night)\n8. Load the dishwasher \n9. Look up your new sunscreens CosDNA rating \n10. Watch an episode on Netflix\n11. Put new products in your amazon cart that will sit there until you cave and buy them\n12. Call your grandmother \n13. Give yourself a pedicure\n14. Bake cookies \n15. Write a journal entry \n16. Meditate \n17. Squeeze in a little yoga or a workout (but not so much that you break a sweat)\n18. Full body stretches \n19. Swatch every product in the house \n20. Browse the new section on SCA...again. \n\n\nLittle edit: \n[Heres a neato link to some quick info on skincare routines and the importance of pH in regards to skin and chemical exfoiliants.](http://i2byivanak.com/index.php/i2/articles/66/)\n\nSnippit from link: \"Once applied, the product must be left on the skin to work. Why? If another product is applied on top immediately, with its own pH higher, this will further alter the pH of the acid-based product.\"\n\nOnce you add any other product (even water) to the BHA or AHA, it alters the pH level, thus rendering it ineffective. This is why using a Salicylic Acid pad is more effective than using a facial wash for cleanser containing Salicylic Acid. It needs time on the skin to work. (Same applies for Benzoyl Peroxide normally as well.) \n\nAnd, of course, these are just suggestions to get some people over the discouragement of wait time.  ",

Then the breakouts started and it was horrible. \n\nI tried using the \n- Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser\n- Biore Witch Hazel\n- Cerave Moisturizing lotion\n\nThe lotion made me break out more so switched back to my Neutrogena Salicylic Acid Moisturizer\n\nNothing worked so i went to the dermatologist and they prescribed me Fluconazole, Desonide 0.05% (topical for redness), and Doxycycline. After 2 weeks everything was gone except for a bit on my forehead. About two days ago i randomly broke out again and nothing is working and i’m about to breakdown lol. \n\nMy current routine is \n- Cerave Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser\n- Hero Collective balancing toner\n- Cerave Ultra-Light Moisturizing Gel (only use in the a.m.)\nAnd i’ve been using the Cerave Acne Control Gel and pimple patches from curology (which have been amazing might i add, at Target for 10 bucks for 40 patches)\n\nI legitimately don’t know if it’s because of what i’m using or my diet because i am eating differently than what i used to, but not unhealthily. It is itchy at times but not painful, so i know it’s what i had before. I have combination skin and it’s a little more on the sensitive side. Any advice on what to change or how to clear this up would be amazing and i would be forever grateful 😭",

    "body": "Biggest contributor to my skin one year ago was the fact that I was addicted to heroin. I was constantly scratching my skin and physically exfoliating because it makes you itch like crazy. Once I started recovery I got really into skincare but finding the right products for my skin was so hard. I have super sensitive combination skin. I reacted badly to almost every product | tried, either directly after applying or it would make me break out after 1-2 days. I wasted so much money on skincare items but at least it wasn't for nothing because I finally have a routine that my skin loves! :)\n\nStep one: Avene xeracalm oil cleanser\n\nStep two: Isana ultra sensitive calming serum\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Polyglycery -6 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Coco-Caprylate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Oenothera Biennis Oil, Panthenol, Ethylhexy|glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Pantolactone\n\nRight now it's still hot where I live so it's hydrating enough but when it gets colder I use vaseline at night to look in the moisture.\n\nI also use tea tree oil as spot treatment for pimpler & Salicylic acid to exfoliate when I can tell mys v needs it (less than once a week, even that was tu-much for my sensitive skin, it caused break outs)\n\nI do also use sunscreen but I haven't found the right one yet. If someone with similar skin problems has any advice l'd appreciate it!",

I would say if you're a fan of the Avene  brand I would try their facial suncreen in the small bottle or their face and body sunscreen in the bigger bottle. Both are SPF 50 I believe and are mineral so there's less of a risk of irritation. My skin is like yours, I know how hard it can be for us to find products that work and ease irritation and sensitivity.",

I thought I’d tried everything; well, apparently I hadn’t. \n\n\nI used Paula’s Choice on my buttcheeks, waxed bikini line, armpits, and back/shoulders for the first time ever last week — and the texture with which I’ve lived for a decade is GONE. No more painful ingrown hairs; no more skin-colored bumps on my ass or shoulders that tempt my dermatillomania into rearing its ugly head. What the actual hell, you guys. \n\n\nI bought stridex pads and am hoping they will be the same holy grail type effect for my body because I can’t afford to cover my skin in Paula’s Choice from head to toe every day. I could cry from relief. I have always been so self conscious of my picking scars/skin texture, but now I feel that I finally am seeing light at the end of the tunnel. If only it hadn’t taken me this long to realize. \n\n\nI’m sure I’m late to the party with this one, but in case you are too — if you suffer with ingrowns, use salicylic acid!!\n\nETA [this is the Paula’s Choice to which I was referring!](https://a.co/d/hSReAm8)",

Lo and behold, for the last 3 weeks I have not had a single new pimple and the weird raised bumps are starting to disappear.\n\nTook me more than 10 yrs.\n\nYou've inspired me, I think I'll try it on my legs as well.",
