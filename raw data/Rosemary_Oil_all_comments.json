    "body": "So maybe a long ramble but I the first pic is from May 2022, the second from January 2023, the third is from October 2023 and the last is July 2024. \n\nNot sure if this is average hair growth but my growth was super slow for ages. And now it feels back to normal. \n\nI was experiencing hair fall and thinning for ages so decided to chop my hair to get it feeling thicker. This worked for a bit but ultimately the hair fall kept happening.\n\nFinally I took myself to the doctor and a simple blood test gave me all my answeres. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and now finally I could get treated. My hair thinning stopped as soon as I started medication.\n\nI was so obsessed with the curly girl method and thinking I was going crazy and the damage and hair fall was heat and processing when really it was a literal thyroid dysfunction.\n\nBut it was also a kick up the bum to stop the heat and carelessness. I started being careful about what was going on my hair and in my body.\n\nI stated taking a multivitamin everyday and it has become an important part of my routine.\n\nI hair oil once a week with rosemary oil mixed with castor, almond and jojoba. \n\nI wash with either\naussie miracle moist shampoo and conditioner\nwatermans grow me shampoo and conditioner\nalberto balsam shampoo and conditioner \nnizarol ketoconazole shampoo \n\nI used to be silicone and sulphate free but now I switch it up and change it depending on what my hair wants.\n\nI style with boots own brand curl creme and wella shockwaves mousse, then diffuse or airdry.\n\nAnd most importantly I practice all the coping mechanisms that work for me to keep my stress down. I try eat enough protein but I try stay kind to myself. If I'm having a bad hair day - that's fine.\n\nFor those of us on a curly hair journey - your hair is beautiful no matter what! To be honest my hair is a lot thinner than it used to be and I don't know if I'll ever get the density back but I'm learning to love my curls and whatever mess they give me.",

    "body": "Hi everyone! I posted this on another sub not too long ago and because of the positive reaction I wanted to share it with you all. Hope you like it.      \n      \nLittle bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n                \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My pimples reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n  \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**\n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.

    "body": "Little bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n        \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My acne reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n   \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**   \n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.",

I also very recently lost my husband in early January due to blood cancer. \nEver since Eloise was a baby she has had really gorgeous hair. It’s always been a gorgeous colour and has grown so beautiful.\nIn my MIL’s family it is a tradition to shave their hair when they turn one. Ever since Eloise was 9 months old she has been pushing this. She has been telling us how we have to shave her hair when she turns one year old.\nEloise turned one on the 22nd of February. We didn’t throw a huge party of any kind as I am still grieving my husband and didn’t have time to think of anything.\nMy MIL is not a helpful person, she rarely does anything helpful. I don’t ask anything of her, Eloise is my child not hers. Well she messaged me asking if she could take Eloise out for a birthday MacDonalds. I was more surprised the anything but I said sure. It was booked and about a week later she took her out, she came back about an hour and a half later. With a MacDonalds and a bald Eloise. \nI looked at her and I asked my MIL to leave. She gave me the bag of her hair?? Then left. I cried, I kept crying at her bald head. Her hair was always something I was really proud of, and it was all gone. It was all sat in a plastic ziplock back.\nI haven’t seen my MIL since. We’ve started using rosemary oil on her hair and it’s started to grow back, however it’s growing back after and it’s making me so sad.\nAnyone know how to deal with a situation like this?",

I'm now a sunless tanner :-)  On March 6 of last year I began Tretinoin gel 0.1%. One year later I can really see a difference!\n\nRoutine: AM wash, Niacinamide toner, Matrixyl 3000,  Vitamin C Serum, and  Cerave AM Moisturizer SPF 30. PM wash with Olay cleansing cloths, Matrixyl 3000, Neutrogena Hydro boost,  Tretinoin and another layer of Hydro boost withw a drop of rosemary oil. Medical tape on 11s and forehead lines overnight. I also use a jade roller a few times a week and derma roller once a week and drink lots of water. ",

    "body": "18 years old - finally starting to get my hairline back. Sharing my progress and routine after almost 2 years of trying.\n\nSo I just turned 18 a week ago, and I wanted to share my journey with hair loss and how I’ve been slowly turning things around. Hopefully this helps someone out there—especially if you’re starting young like I did.\n\nIt all began in June 2023, when I was 16. I started noticing my hair wasn’t the same—it looked thinner, especially around the hairline. It felt like a mix of stress, acne, and genetics that triggered it. That’s when I realized my hairline is receding and not the same.\n\nIn August 2023, still 16, I got a 6-month supply of minoxidil. I started using it, but I wasn’t consistent. I had periods where I used it and then stopped, and the shedding didn’t really slow down. I also tried things like rosemary oil and other natural methods, but honestly, \nnone of that made a difference and only made it worst—probably because I didn’t have the right knowledge at the time, and I was still young to be on finasteride.\n\n In August 2024, A few months before turning 18, That’s when it got better\n\nstarted using minoxidil daily, (I had on and off periods) \n\nwith tretinoin 0.025%, tretinoin really made me feel like I’m finally started responding to minoxidil properly.\n\n\tMy Hair Routine:\n\t•\tFinasteride 1mg – once daily\n\t•\tTopical Minoxidil – twice a day\n\t•\tMorning: Minoxidil only\n\t•\tNight: Minoxidil \n             (mixed with Tretinoin 0.25%)      \n\t•\tKetoconazole shampoo – 2–3 times a week\n(Has been shown to reduce DHT Levels in the scalp.) And I genuinely feel like this shampoo has made a real difference for my hair.\n\nOn the other days of the week, I use a natural shampoo that’s free of salts, SLS, and parabens.\n\n\t•\tDermarolling, 0.75mm dermaroller \n             used to be with 1.5 also\n– twice a week (I’m not that consistent with it)\n\nI can honestly say this routine is what made me start seeing real improvement,and I’m lucky I caught it early\n\nand especially once I started finasteride 4 months ago, the best decision I’ve made. \n\n",

You're preying on people who are already pretty down in a lot of ways in life. \n\nBut she says the CDC backs it, there was an article! I know there wasn't but I google anyways.

To me, that's just plain evil, to say something like that. You're pulling people away from a legitimate treatment so they can spend more money on your snake oil.\n\nSo she goes on for a bit about how Rosemary oil or whatever is THE cure for cancer. It's worth noting that she, like many her age is suuuper Christian. \n\nAfter a bit of the I just give a judgemental hum and say, \"I don't know.

It's nearly 100 pages full of curated information to help answer all of your curl-related questions. You can use the included Table of Contents (page 2), the side bar, or CTRL-F to search for keywords and help navigate the document.\n\n**Reminder:** [Curl type](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6Dj9WAZxlfBhJSyS5on2rw3-if5cOV3oV-dQ3B0AHA/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=kix.e9uk1qyai8oh) is NOT your hair type! Whether you are wavy, curly, or coily - you have texture and you belong here. More than that, your curl type doesn't dictate how you care for your hair. To help your curls thrive, we recommend instead using the wiki link above to learn about your porosity, texture, and density.\n\n**If this is a photo submission:** Please include your detailed routine for your post to remain active! This MUST include the *brands* of ALL products used, *order* of application and *technique* used to apply them, how you dried your hair, and anything else that you might find useful for people to know.\n\n**If you received this message in error:** Please disregard this comment!

Use your finger nails to massage the conditioner into your scalp to remove excess skin, clogged pores, etc.  Then let the conditioner sit in your hair the entire duration of the shower/bath then rinse at the end.  After 2 weeks I noticed new hair growth. After about 2 months, more thickness. I couldn't see my scalp in the mirror with the light shining on my head anymore after 3 months.",

I would only wash it with cheap shampoo and cheap conditioner and that was it. My diet has gotten way better, and I currently take many different vitamins to complement it, but my hair has been destroyed since I moved to the USA. \nIt’s very fragile and has extremely dry ends. For four years I’ve been dealing with a lot of hair loss and recently, it started breaking at the ends. \nI spend a lot of time and money on my hair routine now. \nI use K18, Amika bond repair mask, and do deep oiling treatment on my roots and ends using many different types of pure organic natural oils like avocado oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, grape seed oil, castor oil and argan oil. I apply a few drops of rosemary oil every wash and massage it well. I’m losing my hopes to have my hair back, and I feel sad whenever I comb my hair. Has anyone had the same experience and have tips to share with me? I don't understand how my diet back then was so much worse, my hair routine was way simpler, but my hair is so weak now. Thank you for your input :)",

Maybe you could try getting your blood work checked for vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin D? And I’d say add more moisture to your hair to compensate if the climate is drier, but it sounds like you do that already.\n\nSomething else I’ve looked into is a water filter which other people have mentioned - I think the water is “harder” in the part of Sweden where I live now versus where I come from in the US. (This varies region to region, so you could try googling the water “hardness” where you live.)\n\nFinal thought, have you changed birth control methods? Hormones can really mess with hair volume! \n\nYou had and have beautiful hair, but I understand being sad that it has lost volume etc. I hope you can get it back to its original beauty! Good luck!",

    "body": "Hey guys, as the end of 2023 nears, I thought I'd do a post for those coming to this sub in desperate need of help.\n\n*I posted this to* r/tressless *recently and quite a few people reached out asking for me to post it in this sub as well, so here you go. Hope it helps :)*\n\nIn this post I’m going to be talking about the science of hair loss and what to do if you are balding and want to stop it.\n\nI’m a medical student and have donated a lot of my personal time to pharmacology, hormones and hair protocols through research and experimentation. There’s a lot going on here on Reddit, and as a beginner it can be very daunting to decide on what to do. Obviously everything should be discussed with your doctor, but below is my best attempt at a guide to explain a little bit about hair loss:\n\n\\-\n\nI first noticed I was balding around 12 months ago, and rather than get caught up in the genetics of hair loss and trying to figure out whether it was Dad, my Mum’s Dad, my Mum’s Dad’s Dad or the goldfish he owned when he was 10, I thought to myself:\n\n>I can’t change my **genetics**. Whatever my DNA sequencing (genomic regions) has in store for me in regards to balding, that’s pretty much set. The best I can do is fight as long as I can using the highest quality science, products and methodologies to offset it.\n\nAnd that’s what I’ve been doing, with good success, over the past 12 months.\n\nLet’s get into it, and I’m going to do this in order of most important to least (in my opinion).\n\n**Getting to the root cause: DHT**\n\nOkay, so if we look at the entire testosterone/HPT axis pathway, cholesterol is converted to testosterone and some people think that’s the end of the line, but it’s actually not; 5-alpha reductase (5A1/2 in the image **below**) is the enzyme responsible for converting Testosterone (T) to its much more potent form DHT (dihydrotestosterone).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5-alpha reductase converts Testosterone to DHT, the hair killer.](https://preview.redd.it/n6y4w3vdhy6c1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdb73986cc2ec66db0b0c603f31a09b0a6533e86)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, interestingly, 5-alpha reductase for whatever reason is very high prevalent in skin tissue - including the human scalp. ***And side note***: this is why guys who take testosterone gel or cream often have very high levels of DHT compared to guys who take injections, because the cream is being converted through the skin into DHT at a much higher rate than injectable esters into muscle bellies. But, basically, it is this 5-alpha reductase activity in the scalp that is converting testosterone to DHT, and DHT through a variety of mechanisms leads to follicular miniaturisation (hair thinning, and eventual loss of your hair follicles).\n\nBut **why**? Well, there are hundreds of factors: hormonal (androgen receptor density & sensitivity to said androgens), physical, genetic, environmental. The list goes on.\n\nNote; [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4174066/) goes into a lot more depth for those of you interested.\n\n*But, how do we actually combat balding?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Most men tend to lose their hair in patterns as described by the famous Norwood Scale.](https://preview.redd.it/flz77b1ihy6c1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a280213c646ca2a81008fac2f70a2fb91df53426)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Slowing Down Male Pattern Baldness**\n\n**5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride):**\n\nWith how much I’ve spoken about 5-alpha reductase and DHT, it seems logical that stopping this conversion of Testosterone to DHT is the absolute first line of defence against hair loss.\n\nTo really, truly combat hair loss, the first mechanism is as follows: **you absolutely need to reduce your hair follicles’ exposure to DHT.**\n\nAnd how do we do this? Well, finasteride is a drug that acts as a **5-alpha reductase inhibitor**. Sold under the name **Propecia**, the molecule is a strong 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, and has been shown to inhibit around 70% of serum (blood) levels of DHT from peak. The usual starting dose is 1mg daily. Dutasteride (sold under the name **Avodart**) is an even more potent inhibitor (usual starting daily dose is 0.5mg), and can block up to 98% of conversion from T to DHT: it is a much more potent inhibitor of the enzyme that converts T to DHT. Dutasteride would be an option if you wanted a nuclear option to block almost all DHT. In fact, one of my favourite [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15126539/) compared the difference between Finasteride vs. Dutasteride, and as you can see below, the suppression of DHT levels from Dutasteride was significantly more than Finasteride. Not only this, but the half life of Dutasteride is significantly longer than Finasteride (\\~8 hours vs. 5 weeks!), and you can see that in the Dutasteride group after stopping treatment (Follow-up Period), DHT levels remained suppressed for a much longer time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DHT vs. Finasteride - what a study.](https://preview.redd.it/n4xi7k5khy6c1.jpg?width=902&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60e4cec6b02d753cfcf88949b6f042e4e01c23c9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide effects from 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are rare, although we should speak about them. Online, through various forums, Reddit posts, YouTube videos and TikTok’s time and time again I see posts about nasty Finasteride side effects, post-Finasteride syndrome and how Rob can’t get his Johnson hard anymore because of Finasteride, so his girlfriend left him.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong, side effects have been noted, although current research puts the risk of side effects at around [1-3% of people](https://www.drugwatch.com/propecia/side-effects/), so even though online there is a lot of noise about finasteride and its side effects, I personally don’t think the research supports this scaremongering. There is also going to be a natural selection bias with the stories online, because the guy for whom Finasteride is working well and who is not experiencing any side effects, he isn’t really going to post. Because why would he? He’s doing fine.\n\nHowever, I absolutely sympathise with the people who just cannot tolerate 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Side effects can be very real, and this is why it is vitally important to always consult with a qualified doctor before deciding on any medication: I’m just presenting the science. Everyone reacts slightly differently, and these can be strong medications - so it's important to be well-informed and sensible with whatever path you and your medical practitioner decide to go down.\n\n**Topical Minoxidil 5% (Rogaine):**\n\nMinoxidil is a compound that has been shown to increase the rate of DNA synthesis in anagen (growth phase) bulbs of hair follicles. Basically minoxidil stimulates hair cells to move from telogen (resting phase) to anagen (growing phase) - so instead of having hair follicles resting, it is telling the body to move them back into a growth phase by shortening the resting phase. The idea here is that you get more ‘regrowth’ of hair follicles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/siqcfdpmhy6c1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac56d4b93fa442dd69e8e528ebccc6ced1d40a12\n\nMinoxidil stimulates hair cells to shorten the resting (telogen) phase and go back into an anagen (growing phase). Often, progress pictures will show significant new regrowth or ‘baby’ hairs growing with minoxidil treatment.\n\nI apply *Rogaine*, a 5% strength Minoxidil foam twice daily in areas that I feel are receding. The nice thing about the foam is that it isn’t super sticky (unlike some people report with the gel), and it also acts as a nice way to hold my hair throughout the day, like hair product.\n\nAs you can see from the photo below, there is a vast difference between telogen (resting phase) and anagen (growing phase), and the idea is that the more hairs you can keep in anagen, the more healthy your hair will be, by limiting the amount of follicles that inevitably go through an anagen restart and die off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Come on little baby hairs! Grow!](https://preview.redd.it/zj94e0xqhy6c1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3942dea0d9bc60cbc5f686850678e1e93f566876)\n\nThere is also the option of oral minoxidil, which anecdotally at least seems to be very powerful at regenerating ‘baby’ hairs (or, new regrowth). Again, oral minoxidil can have some pretty significant side effects and drug interactions with blood pressure medications, so speaking through with your doctor is key!\n\n**Ketoconazole Shampoo:**\n\nThis shampoo is primarily an anti-dandruff shampoo, but research has shown it may increase the proportion of hairs in anagen phase (growth phase) - resulting in reduced hair shedding. [This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18498517/) showed that 1% ketoconazole shampoo increased hair diameter over baseline after 6 months of use and reduced shedding. Interestingly, participants’ hair diameter also increased over baseline, showing that it may play a role in creating thicker hair.\n\nNizoral is a common brand here in Australia of 2% strength ketoconazole shampoo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7v1n7jmuhy6c1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe9ce28ca47c63f85e48b2bd7b633304984414c4\n\nWhat is good about ketoconazole, is that it’s also a weak androgen receptor antagonist. What does this mean? It means it competes with DHT and Testosterone for binding to the active binding domain on the human AR (androgen receptor). If a compound can bind to a receptor without influencing its usual effects, it is said to be an **antagonist**. Basically, if ketoconazole can get into an androgen receptor before Testosterone or DHT, it will occupy that site and block T/DHT from binding and starting their usual process of killing off hair follicles (follicular miniaturisation).\n\nGoodbye DHT, nobody wants you here.\n\n**Dermarolling**\n\nDerma-what?\n\nDermarolling is the process of creating micro punctures in the scalp skin to induce a wound healing response, with an array of tiny microneedles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h00i0hnwhy6c1.jpg?width=1082&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0af7396fe22eee3ec5d1fbb7f0a63f340649b71\n\nIn this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746236/), the dermarolling + minoxidil treated group was statistically superior to the minoxidil only treated group in promoting hair growth in men with balding patterns, for all primary efficacy measures of hair growth. In fact, the microneedling group outperformed even the minoxidil group in terms of how much hair was regrown after 12 weeks:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mm7v28uyhy6c1.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7530984fd25b7987560033104629c678836c6e93\n\nThe mechanism seems to be that continued microtrauma to the scalp skin leads to a release of platelet derived growth factors and other growth factors that are sent to the area of scalp, to aid in the skin wound regeneration. The added benefit is that there seems to be some carry over effect to hair growth, as dermarolling seems to activate stem cells or ‘unspecialised’ cells that are yet to be differentiated, and differentiate them into hair follicle cells, meaning more hair growth. Basically, its a wound healing response that brings growth factors to the area of the scalp to increase hair growth.\n\nI have played around with a few different protocols, but I use a 1.5mm roller and roll horizontally, vertically and diagonally for about 30 seconds in areas where my hairline is thinning or receding. I do this every 10 days. You don’t want to press so hard that you draw blood, but it should also hurt slightly. I mean, putting hundreds of tiny spikes into your scalp isn’t really my idea of Sunday night fun. But hey, if it regrows some hair why not?\n\nThere are also derma-stamps and motorised tools, all of which assist with the end goal: creating a wound healing response to bring growth factors to the scalp, and potentially assist the penetration of Minoxidil deeper into the scalp skin tissue.\n\n**Natural DHT blocking compounds:**\n\nNatural DHT blockers are also options, although obviously the results aren’t going to be nearly as strong as what is mentioned above.\n\nSome people have good results (anecdotally) with rosemary oil applied topically, green tea and saw palmetto are options here. However, the science is very hit and miss, and in any event, I can’t see natural compounds competing against the 'Big 4'.\n\n**RU58841:**\n\nNow, that’s all good, but what if you need a nuclear chemical. Something that would attack the androgen receptor at a direct level in your scalp? Well, that compound is below. But a quick **warning**: I do not recommend this compound. A lot of people use it, but that doesn’t mean it’s safe. There is no (yes, zero) long-term safety data on the compound below, and whether you choose to take a completely untested chemical is up to you. But I don’t recommend it - have I said that enough?\n\nAlright so, apart from sounding like a bunch of random letters because your cat ran over your keyboard, RU58841 is a strong DHT blocker (it has been shown to inhibit around 70% of DHT binding to the androgen receptor), but not in the way that Finasteride or Dutasteride work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The chemical structure of RU58841.](https://preview.redd.it/pjcxd447jy6c1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=883a2d0bbe6744e9c96613e38405883fe99f1c8a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of finasteride and dutasteride which work on inhibiting the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, RU58841 works on the AR itself - occupying the active site, so that when DHT tries to get in and exert its hair destructive effects in the scalp, it can’t, it’s literally ***blocked*** from accessing the active site of the androgen receptor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RU58841 operates like an androgen receptor antagonist \\(3rd receptor, on the right\\). It binds to the receptor and stops testosterone and DHT from binding, meaning that DHT cannot then exert its hair miniaturisation effects.](https://preview.redd.it/qi851jy8jy6c1.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=4242c8ff517eb5525f98e4721318789d0f7600b6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd in [this study](https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-e5b77395-5e0e-3da3-bef2-0eadea69c845), RU58841 was found to inhibit 70% of DHT binding. Combining something like finasteride or dutasteride which attacks 5-alpha reductase converting T to DHT with RU58841 which stops \\~70% of DHT binding to the androgen receptor, and you’d now be attacking hair loss from 2 *vectors*: **T to DHT conversion, as well as at a receptor level**. Now you can start to understand why this is a nuclear option for hair loss, and incredibly powerful.\n\nHowever, despite how good all of that sounds in practice, just remember, RU58841 is completely untested in regards to side effects. There is no long-term safety data on how it may or can impact human health, so what I’m saying (for legal reasons) is don’t use it. Get what I’m saying?\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAnd, there it is guys. Now, just a quick note, this isn’t a super comprehensive list of all supplements for a hair regrowth/hair protection protocol, but is a solid start.\n\nThere are certainly more ‘niche’ options, or compounds in development now that may be promising (or not, looking at you Phase 3 of Pyrilutamide trials), but this guide was just the bare basics for a beginner to wrap his head around (no pun intended) the science and how to start combatting AGA.\n\nIn particular, if you want to save your hair, it’s going to be the ‘**big 4**’: finasteride (or Dutasteride), Minoxidil, Ketoconazole shampoo and derma-rolling roughly once a week to every 2 weeks.\n\nThis would follow the best possible science that we have at the moment, in terms of targeting as many vectors as possible:\n\n1. T to DHT blockade (5-alpha reductase inhibitors, Fin/Dut)\n2. Anagen/telogen manipulation (Minoxidil)\n3. Localised scalp tissue androgen receptor antagonism (Keto, RU58841)\n4. Wound healing response cascade (physical microneedling/trauma)\n\nHope you enjoyed and got something out of this guide! My social links are on my profile if interested in more.",

Unbeknownst to me, my roommate, in a bid to be helpful, has been spraying his enclosure down when I am not home if she sees the humidity level drop. It is a super kind thought, and she is so sweet for trying to help, but the problem is the sprayer she was using is the one we keep in the kitchen, that has Teatree and rosemary oil in it to control pests on our plants, rather than the one I keep in a box under the coffee table. This obviously is a big no-no, and when I went to check on Fettuccine today, I noticed that he was super pink and his belly, especially was irritated. I found out what happened from some questioning, and promptly changed all of his substrate, soaked his cork bark hides, and tossed the majority of his fake silk plants. I also have given him a thorough rinse, and let him soak briefly in tepid water to see if I could bring some of the inflammation down and to make sure any residue was off of him. But he is so pink!!! Does anyone have any advice? I called his vet, but they can’t see him for like two months!",

Fake smile, maintain eye contact, and utter phrases like “oh,” or “you’re kidding,” when she pauses. More talk about essential oils being necessary. No, you don’t *need* rosemary oil to reset your chakras during yoga.\n\nLying on the floor scrolling through Instagram isn’t yoga.\n\nMy ‘best friend,’ while entertaining, reminds me of a painting that isn’t quite level. If I get close enough I can never correct it, but it’s always nearly falling off. It’s also on fire. Metaphorically, of course.\n\n“Yaaaaasssss,” she claps excitedly, receiving her fourth bloody mary before noon. “There’s something about having a little *spice* in life, you know?” I’m shocked her body hasn’t failed her yet. But that’s how bffs are, right? Everything I’m not: rich, healthy, attractive. I’d go on but even my therapist shut me down. Just stop talking to her? Oh, you’re funny.\n\nShe’s also my boss.\n\nTo be fair, I wouldn’t have my current boyfriend if he hadn’t approached her a few months ago. I was fortunate enough to be his next choice, and Kristyl was busy texting her husband and two lovers. Or was it three? Four drinks lead to five, and after half a dozen I survive another Sunday brunch. “See you Saturday, right? Mwah.”\n\nAnd Monday. And Tuesday. And all the others; usually my Saturdays are free, but she’s having some kind of party. Her quarter birthday, maybe? Or something about her zodiac sign. It’s incredible she can remember anything with her potato brain.\n\nBut this time I'm ready. I have an excuse planned so I can pop in, drop off a gift, and leave. I almost make it through the week until she asks me to stay late Friday. Since it’s just the two of us, I give her the gift tonight and save tomorrow for myself. Kristyl protests briefly before recognizing the bag.\n\n“Ohmigah! Did you really get me the piccola organic lava stone aromatherapy raindrop nebulizing essential oil diffuser?” she asks in a fraction of a second. I note the ‘you can’t afford this’ in her voice.\n\n“Of course!” I force a smile. “I knew how much you wan- *needed* one!”\n\nAfter helping her set it up (because she can’t do it herself), I add the oil and lock the door behind me to give her some privacy. I shut off the lights and steal one last glance at her sound-proof office.\n\nKristyl’s red, puffy face looks beautiful. She pounds on the glass, which won’t break, and jiggles the doorknob as though she forgets I keep all the keys. I wait a moment to take it all in, and finally smile for real. While she may have *wanted* to relax with some lemon verbena, I gave her a little *spice* for her life. Carolina reaper chili oil. She certainly doesn’t *need* that in her lungs.\n\nBut *I need* her to stop fucking my boyfriend.",

    "body": "Warning this will be a long post, it has everything I've learnt in the past couple of years from hair growth, to styling, to weightloss, to nervous system regulation and more.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, I have 3B hair, tall, two years ago I was obese, prediabetic, I had anxiety problems, now I'm just a tall \\[seemingly ;) \\] effortlessly pretty black girl and I want all my beauties on here to have my beauty secrets.\n\nTopics discussed:\n\n* Haircare\n* Style\n* Makeup \n* Teeth\n* Skincare\n* Weight loss vs Fat loss\n* Healthy Fat loss\n* Body Recomposition \n* Inflammation\n* Gut Health\n* How to lower androgen/testosterone levels\n* Nervous System Regulation/Stress Management \n* Tea Cycling\n* Seed Cycling \n\n# Hair\n\nI have PCOS so it affects my hair growth and causes hirsutism, basically male patterened facial hair and male patterned baldness.\n\n**Hair Growth:** Here is the true secret sauce to hair growth, stimulating your scalp. I do daily scalp massages with a bamboo brush (even the bristles are made of rounded bamboo) very gentle. This is the one I use: [Golab Beauty](https://golabbeauty.com/products/organic-bamboo-scalp-massager-hair-brush)  I do short strokes which prevents any tangles. Morning and Night. I then go in with a scalp serum, I use The Oui scalp serum but it costs a pretty penny. In the first yearish I used (The 'Ordinary' Haircare Growth Set Multi-Peptide Serum For Hair Density) which worked wonders and was cost effective. At nights I seal with any scalp oil that has rosemary oil. Sadly Mielle's formula no longer works for me, but As I Am rosemary oil has been working, I also like the Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Hair and Scalp Drops. For Washing my hair I suffer from sebaceous dermatitis which causes scaliness. Paradoxically my scalp is so oily which is what triggers the ezcema and develops the dry patches. Reversing my PCOS symptoms fixed this but what also helped was the Nizoral shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole. It's harsh so I do it once to twice a month at most and I always follow up with a moisturizing shampoo, and of course finish with a wash out conditioner & leave in conditioner.\n\n**Hair Retention:** This is the info we all know about preventing breakage but I'll include just in case. Hair growth happens in the scalp like said before but to retain that growth it's important to wear protective hairstyles (especially while asleep), a silk/satin bonnet or wrap, silk/satin pillowcase, do not let your hair air dry at night. There is debate about this but I've seen hair specialists and scientists say our hair is especially fragile when wet (especially curly/kinky hair). Therefore, we are much more prone to snags and breakage while our hair is wet. So going to bed make sure your hair is dried. If you're air drying your hair during the day try not to touch it too much  - as little manipulation as possible. Personally choose to diffuse/blow dry my hair and this has prevented most of the breakage I was previously experiencing. Lastly, moisturize and oil your ends. I won't pretend like I know which order is best or even if it's important but I've found that using hair moisturizer/diluted leave in conditioner then hair oil works best for me.\n\n**Hirsutism/Facial Hair:** Spearmint essential oil. I add 1-2 drops of the oil to my moisturizer each time I put on my moisturizer and it helped A LOT with reducing my facial hair. I also drink a lot of spearmint tea. Spearmint specifically has been proven to lower androgen/testosterone levels which is why it helps. I also took supplements which I'll include at the end because they served multiple purposes. Be sure not to add the oil to the entire bottle because that will ruin your moisturizer's formula. Just add the drops in your palm/finger tips and mix in your face cream each time you moisturize your jawline, chin, underneck. Also, do this after moisturizing the upper part of your face without the oil because it's harsh and the scent can be irritating to your eye area.\n\n**Body hair:** Personally I sugar wax my arms and legs, the hair has grown back so thin now. I make it myself and follow tutorials from abetweene on youtube.\n\n**Hair colour/Hairstyle:** This will depend on your face shape and color season. I'm a dark winter colour season and I have a heart face shape. I used the Dressika app to discover my color season before I could afford to get myself professionally assessed and I got the same results. Just be sure to use natural lighting, like by a window. Once you have your colour season you can choose hair colours that work best for you (although natural almost always works best). For my hairstyle I try to choose styles that compliment my heart shaped face. I used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with figuring this out.\n\n# Style\n\nI think most of us know about **Kibbe and colour seasons.** This was how I upgraded my wardrobe. I'm a soft dramatic so I wear things that work for my tall height and accentuate my waist.\n\nThis was the game changer with colour seasons. Most of us know about our true seasons, but it can get restrictive. Sister seasons and colour dissonance is also helpful to know.\n\nMy colour season is dark winter, so my sister seasons would be dark autumn and true winter. Thid gives me more wiggle room to style myself.\n\n**Dissonance** are colours that are outside your true season and your sister seasons, you sprinke this in to add interest. Think of an outfit that is extremely matchy and cohesive but has that one accessory or item that stands out and adds interest. It's really fun in art and in fashion.\n\nFor my **shoes** I've started wearing dancing heels which help my flat feet lol and look stylish. Heel insoles help too, as well as the product Shoe Gummi. I still can't last more than 2, 3 hours at most but it's definitely bearable compared to before.\n\nMatching pajamas and loungewear. You just feel so luxurious dressing up at home and they can (should) be comfy :)\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* I wear glasses that work with my heart shaped face.\n* I have a neutral leaning warm undertone so I wear gold jewelry, if I wear pearls or other gem stones I mix in gold to provide more harmony with my skin.\n* Perfume, wear what works with your body chemistry. Some smell delictable on people I know and icky on me, and vice versa. Wear what works for you.\n* Nails, press ons. So convenient, so cheap.\n* Hair accessories, bows, barretes, clips, scrunchies, a ribbon, you could be wearing jeans and a t shirt but a simple hair accessory upgrades the look automatically.\n\n# Makeup\n\nI used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with finding eye looks, brows, blush placement for my face shape\n\nI have a low visual weight face and I am a romantic ingenue, because of this I go for more subtle looks that emphasis two facial features maximum at a time (eyes, lips, cheeks).\n\nDon't get me wrong I love glam bold makeup but soft and subtle makes me glow, I turn heads when my makeup is done like this.\n\n# Teeth\n\n* Wax free floss (Cocofloss $10 expensive but I love it 😅, Burst black floss, Moon graphite floss, Twice floss, Dr. Jen’s silk floss)\n* Oil pulling (coconut oil with clove & tea tree oil, or Guru Nanda oil pulling product)\n* Brush teeth\n* Tongue scraper (not everyday, couple of times a week and not too hard)\n* Alcohol free mouthwash (TheraBreath)\n* More so related to my lip area but I try to use wrinkle preventing straws or when I do use regular straws, I place it on the side of my mouth. The reason this works is because puckering the lips excessively causes smokers lines/wrinkles around the mouth. \n\n# Skin\n\nSkincare. This was something that took me a while to work on because of my PCOS, age, weight and etc.\n\n**Facial Care:** The basics includes chemical exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover. I cycle my nightly skincare routine with this in mind and always keep the same morning routine. Mornings look like this (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, vitamin c/peptide serum, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, finish with sunscreen).\n\nMy nights I alternate these routines in this order\n\nNight 1 - Chemical Exfoliation (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, glycolic/lactic acid, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire face, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\n*Repeat Night 1 - 3 (sometimes I need more days to recover if my skin is sensitive or acting up, do what works for you personally)*\n\nOther things that I've done/used to help: red light therapy (helps with both hair growth, so I use it on my scalp, and with stretch marks so I use it on my face and body), Microcurrent device (helps with collagen production and stretchmarks) - I use the brand NuFace & NuBody, Volufiline (a skin serum I mix with eye cream that helps with hollowness under the eyes, Kigelia Africana Skin Cream (I use the brand Maelys B-Perky which contains this ingredient and helped to tighten my chest area and my loose skin on the area),  face yoga and myo fascia face massage, these help with the tautness of my face (basically everything else helps with wrinkles, these exercises and the microcurrent helps and prevents, sagging especially jowls). I follow tutorials I search for from youtube.\n\n**Body Care:** Similar to facial care body care includes exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover\n\nNight 1 - Physical Exfoliation (Dry brush/Body Scrub, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, retinol body wash, retinol body lotion)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\n*Again, repeat Night 1 - 3 use more days for recovery if needed*\n\n**Stretch marks/loose skin:** Whether due to weight gain, pregnancy, etc. we can't ever truly get rid of loose skin or stretch marks but moisturizing the skin and derma rolling can help with the appearance. Especially derma rolling. Do NOT derma roll while pregnant but you can do so after when you’ve recovered and talk to your doctor (if you've had a c section you have to wait before derma rolling). I used this video as motivation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A)\n\nFor the body I never went beyond 1.5mm it worked for my deepest stretch marks. If this is too aggressive 1.0mm still works just as well. Make sure you use 70% alcohol as this is what experts say is better at disinfecting. It has more water, which helps it to dissolve more slowly, penetrate cells, and kill bacteria. The disinfecting power of rubbing alcohol drops at concentrations higher than 80%-85%. Make sure you disinfect the derma roller before and after use, and make sure you disinfect your area of contact before rolling as well. Do not do heavy workouts workout or sweat inducing activities for at least 3 days after and avoid harsh products.\n\nI started derma rolling while working on losing weight (at the beginning of my journey while still obese) and continued a year after losing 130lbs. Derma rolling works by causing micro tears, the skin heals the area and in the process of doing so develops more collagen - leading to thicker skin, lighter stretch marks and tighter skin. Since I did this before losing the weight it helped my skin adapt a lot. I won't pretend like I have 0 loose skin or stretch marks but it's barely visible. Someone has to be intimately close to notice. Obviously genetics, how slowly you lose the weight, diet, and moisturizing the skin helps but my PCOS contributed to low collagen (thin skin) and so the derma rolling really helped.\n\n# Weight loss vs Fat loss\n\n**Tons of info here but I promise if you read through it helps to know this stuff.**\n\nWeightloss comes down to calories in versus calories out. I know that's rudely simpliflied and not that easy, but it truly is the answer to **weightloss** (which may be fat, water, or muscle). This is why people can eat barely nothing, lose weight but their shape stays the same (basically skinny fat). It's also why fasting or going low carb works so fast (water weight is the first to go).\n\nFatloss on the other hand is more complicated. This involves our TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).\n\nTDEE includes: Resting/Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Metabolic Equivalent of Task or Exercise activity thermogenesis  (EAT), Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), and Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT).\n\n**BMR (\\~70% daily energy)** the energy taken to exist, so tasks like breathing. Your sex, body composition (muscle to fat ratio), age, and genetics play a role in this  \n**EAT (\\~5% daily energy)** the energy taken for exercise weight lifting, swimming, high intensity walks, etc.  \n**NEAT (\\~15% daily energy)** the energy taken for non exercise movements like walking, fidgeting, showering, standing, etc  \n**TEF (\\~10% daily energy depending on the macronutrients of your meal)** the energy taken to digest, protein has the highest TEF of all the macronutrients, Carbs have a TEF of around 5-10%, while Fats have the lowest TEF, around 0-3%.\n\n**Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT)** is the changes in energy expenditure (energy used) that occur in response to changes in energy balance. For example when you eat more food than you need, your body may increase energy expenditure to prevent weight gain eg. move more, eat less the next day, etc.. On the other hand, when you eat less food than you need, your body may decrease energy expenditure to conserve energy and prevent weight loss eg. less movement, eat more the next day.\n\nOther things that affect AT include diet composition (eg high/low protein, high/low carb, calorie dense foods, etc), physical activity (eg. weights vs. cardio), and environmental factors such as temperature and altitude.\n\nThings that influence AT can make weight management challenging, as it can lead to plateaus or rebounds in weight loss efforts. This is why lack of sleep, hormonal issues, aging, etc. makes weightloss harder.\n\n*Here is a clearer example of this*\n\nThings that affect calories in:\n\n* 8-9 Hours of sleep (Maintains metabolic homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, hormonal processes). Compromised sleep lead to:\n   * Increased Gherlin (hunger hormone - feeling hungrier & therefor eating more)\n   * Decreased Leptin (sensation of satiety - needing to eat more to feel full)\n* Insulin resistance: This is when the cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from your blood. This results in excessive sugar in the blood & as a result the body produces more insulin in order to try to help the cells obtain the energy from glucose. This leads to weight gain as the insulin increases hunger. Also, since the body is insulin resistant, the excess glucose is converted to fat for long-term storage.\n   * Things that can cause insulin resistance: PCOS, Inactivity/sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, poor sleep habits, high cholesterol levels, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, high bodyweight, acromegaly\n\nThings that affect calories out:\n\n* Body Composition (Fat to muscle ratio) \n* Gut health\n* Compromised sleep affects our energy levels which leads to\n   * Decreased NEAT (Non exercise activity thermogenesis)\n* Hypothyroidism (lowered levels of T3 and T4)\n   * Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 affects every cell and all the organs in your body by regulating the rate at which your body uses calories/energy which is known as our bmr, meaning this affects your metabolic rate.\n* Too few calories lowers daily NEAT\n   * By eating below your BMI (calories needed to perform basic biological processes), your body makes up for this through energy conservation by lowering your NEAT (non exercise activity thermogenesis). Basically you lack the energy to perform your normal daily activities. This also affects your body composition and cardio health as you become sedentary (stop moving as much).\n\n# Healthy Fat loss\n\nSo to lose fat in a healthy way you need to:\n\n1. Get enough sleep (8-9 hours per night)\n2. **Manage your stress levels/nervous system regulation**\n3. **Look after your gut health**\n4. **Manage inflammation**\n5. Increase your daily steps (8-10k per day)\n6. **Weight lift**\n7. **Eat high protein (protein takes the most amount of energy to digest).**\n8. **Manage your insulin resistence**\n9. **Eat in a caloric deficit (make sure your calories in do not exceed calories out).**\n\nFuther information about the bold items in the list is included below. Also, I know this all seems overwhelming but keep in mind you are creating a lifestyle change. This is not a quick fix. \n\nTo **manage your insulin resistance** (info from the book Glucose Goddess by Jessie Inchauspé):\n\n* Eat within an hour of waking up\n* Protein with breakfast\n* Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before each meal (diluted in a glass of water)\n* Eat foods in this order, veggies -> protein -> fat -> starches -> carbs -> sugar\n* Never eat sweets/dessert/carbs on an empty stomach (dessert after dinner)\n* Keep refined carbs and added sugar at a minimum.\n* Minimize alcohol intake\n* Try to minimize sodas, fruit juice and sweet drinks (this is because there is no fiber to help with the glucose spike or at least try to have these drinks after eating something fiberous)\n* Only eat fruit whole, not transformed eg. eat the orange instead of having the orange juice, again fiber makes a world of a difference\n* Put clothing on your carbs. Eg. have protein/fats/fiber with your carbs\n* A short walk after carb heavy meals\n* Fasting - this is controversial and I should add a disclaimer, if you in any way shape or form have or had an eating disorder, especially restrictive eating, I highly recommend against fasting. Intermittent fasting has a lot of studies out there that were done on men. The book Fast Like a Girl by Dr. Mindy Pelz includes a nuanced view of fasting that takes into account our hormones and our monthly cycle. She also has a free app 'Fast like a girl', you log your period and it tells you how long to fast. However, bioindividuality is key here, genetics, etc. Please if you are considering fasting make sure you get bloodwork done first. Manage your electrolyte levels, do not neglect iron and protein levels. Personally, I prefer using the other methods since fasting can also inadvertently worsens insulin resistence due to increased stress/cortisol which cause higher hunger cues. Some with insulin resistence found fasting to be helpful. So make sure you do what works for you and always consult your doctor. \n* Supplements:\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n   * Inositol\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\nTo eat in a **caloric deficit**, calculate your TDEE and subtract 200-500 calories from that number. I like using this calculator.   \n[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net)\n\nEg. If it's calculated to be 2000 calories, you subtract 200, so 1800 should be your daily calorie intake. For the activity levels make sure you do not oversell yourself. Here is a general guide:\n\n* Sedentary: Office job sat all day or less than 3000 steps per day\n* Lightly Active: Exercise 1-3 times per week or 3-10k steps daily (up to 3-4 miles daily)\n* Moderately Active: Exercise 3-5 times per week or 10-15k steps daily (up to 4-7 miles daily)\n* Highly Active: Hard exercise 6-7 training days per week or 15-20k steps daily (up to 7-10 miles daily)\n* Extremely Active: Intense daily exercise/hard physical labour 7 days a week or 25k+ steps daily (up to 10 miles daily)\n\nAs you lose weight your body adapts so after a while you may need to recalculate your TDEE and deficit. Once you are at your ideal weight, you no longer subtract the 200-500, you simply eat the TDEE amount to maintain but you do this gradually. After I lost the weight I came out of the deficit by adding 50 calories to my daily intake per week, till I was at maintenance/my TDEE. This prevented me from gaining fat or water weight.\n\nLastly, muscle mass (increase in muscle raises your metabolic level, meaning you burn more calories at rest). This is ideal and is also how you'll see someone who is short, seemingly small but weigh more than you imagined. Muscle density weighs more than fat. Think of a 50 pound dumbbell versus 50 pounds of feathers, you would need a whole lot of feathers to match the weight. Same difference, you need a larger volume of fat to equal to the same amount of muscle. Therefore, lifting weights is ideal because you will become more toned, burn more calories at rest, be able to eat more even when you've lost the weight to maintain your phisique, you'll be more insulin sensitive, and you will have stronger and higher bone density (really important for women, we lose up to 5% of muscle mass per decade after the age of 30).\n\n# Body Recompositon: Weightlifting for health (and aesthetics), lose fat & gain muscle\n\nIt is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. I followed Huskular Goddess and and LexiiGettingFit for inspiration and they were really the ones that opened my eyes to the concept of body recomposition (gain musle while losing fat). \n\nThe benefits of this is as you're getting smaller your TDEE is increasing. This means by the time you lose the weight you'll still be eating an adequate amount. The other benefits include insulin sensitivity versus insulin resistence, higher metabolism, and a improved body composition like I mentioned before in the dummbell versus feather example. The downside is the number on the scale won't have a dramatic shift while your clothes will be fitting looser. Again, weight density plays tricks on us and it's easy to get caught up in body dismorphia but I promise it works. \n\nIn order to sustain and build muscle while losing fat, you need to be consuming enough protein while remaining in a caloric deficit. So 60-80g of protein per day minimum to lose 1-2lbs per week. Ideally it should be 0.8-1g of per pound of lean body mass. Eg, someone is 300lbs and they want to get down to 150lbs. They would eat 120-150g of protein per day. If this is too much, try to get at least 60-80g like I mentioned before. Remember even though 1-2lbs per week sounds small, the changes are significant because of the muscle gained. You will look and feel smaller.  \n\n**Weightlifting for a rounder booty** (I reshaped my glutes by weightlifting. Hormones can actually affect the shape and my PCOS did a number on me. I developed a V shape over the years. Round, square, heart, A shapes are all based on your bone structure and fat placement. Some of us just have those stubborn fat deposits in certain areas that are genetic, even when we lose the weight, it's a smaller version but the same shape. V shape on the other hand is largely seen in older women post menopause and in younger women with hormonal disorders. This is becuase the hormonal imbalances also causes muscle imbalances. Regulating your hormones helps but it won't grow the muscles for you, so I used Fit With Emely's glute guide based on your glute shape (completely free, I watched all her videos to get this info and it took me two years to go from a V shape to a round shape.\n\nHere is the guideline for each shape:\n\n**Glute Maximus** - Everyone should be working on glute maximus. It builds the shelf and overall size. Step ups (all variations), hip thrusts (all variations), lunges, rdl, leg press, all squat variations  \n**Glute Minimus** - (V and Square shapes), this muscle fills in the middle between the top and lower glute. Hip abduction, single leg bridge, Standing hip abduction/cable raises  \n**Gute Medius** - (Heart, Round, and A-shaped) this muscles builds a longer hip for top portion of the glutes. Eg. Single leg squat, Single leg deadlift, Cable clamshells, Reverse lung, step ups  \n**Underbutt** - Everyone should be working on underbutt but this is especially useful for V shaped folks. It works the hamstrings and lower portion of glutes. Good mornings, single leg rdl (also works minimus), single leg hip thrust (also works maximus), hip abductors (also works minimus)\n\nHow to structure workout:\n\n* Warm up/Dynamic Stretches (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body warm up or upper body warm up, etc.)\n* Compound exercises (2-3 exercises eg. single leg rdl, good mornings, leg press - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets). That probably sounds like a foreign language to some, so for instance:\n   * **Start excercise 1**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 2**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 3**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n* Secondary Workouts (2-3 exercises eg. step ups, bulgarian split squats, lunges - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets)\n* Isolated/Accessory Movements: these exercises work one part of the muscle more than others, for example an overbias on the underbutt/hamstring like I mentioned before to help with the V shape ( eg. hip abductors, kickbacks, glute bridge, lying leg raises, etc. (1-2 exercises high repetitions, low weight 2-3 sets, 15-20 reps, 1-2 minute rest between sets)\n* Static stretch/cool down (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body cool down or upper body cool down, etc.)\n\nKeep in mind that you only need to work on a muscle group 2-3 times a week. So I only do glutes Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Also keep in mind while I work the lower body I am also working my upper body (eg. while doing rdls I am lifting the weight with my upper body), which is why I don't have tailered upper body days, this is for aesthetic reasons, and because weightlifting more than 3 days per week is not feasible with my PCOS. \n\nMy full routine is:\n\n* Monday- lower body\n* Tuesday - Pilates/core\n* Wednesday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n* Thursday - lower body\n* Friday - Pilates/core\n* Saturday - lower body\n* Sunday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n\nI also used primarily resistance bands in the beginning because gym equipment intimidated me (not anymore :) ). I started with 25lb resistance and went up to 125lbs. I use the product BandBar which allowed me to use the resistance bands like a barbell at home. This isn’t the only option and you can definitely buy resistance bands and do it without the bar. [BandBar](https://shopbandbar.com)\n\nFor the ab separation from being obese, I did this workout 3 times a week (also helpful post pregnancy): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0)\n\nFor my chest to help with getting perkier boobs (the derma rolling was what made the biggest difference, but this exercise helped as well though it took 6+ months for the changes to be significant. Women tend to take longer to grow chest muscles): [https://youtu.be/hg7\\_R29jGIE?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/hg7_R29jGIE?feature=shared)\n\nI also did workouts to help with my posture and mobility 3 times a week (any I could find online)\n\nThe last thing I will say is be mindful that you may gain weight initially when you start lifting weights. This is due to slight inflammation/water gain from foreign tension, which will last about a month or two before you adapt BUT your body will adapt, I promise. Keep in mind if it's days before your period or if you are on your period. It's not if, but when, our weight fluctuates. As long as you are in a deficit and doing everything right, the number will go down. Do not get discouraged!!!\n\n***Here is the edit to this post which includes my supplements, how I managed my inflammation, and how I improved my gut health. I also edited the information I shared prior to include a few more tips and lifestyle changes I made, and included a few more details. I also rearranged things so there is a separation between style/hair/skin and health information. The post is getting really long so I may create a separate post for personal development/mindset tips.*** \n\n# Inflammation\n\nIn my case my inflammation was caused by my PCOS, insulin resistence and my obesity, but it can be caused by chronic stress, other autoimmune disorders like IBS, Crohn's disease, etc, smoking/alcohol, age related diseases, environmental toxins, diets high in processed foods, sugars, trans fats & high omega-6 fatty acids. \n\nIn my case the inflammation from the PCOS led to gut inflammation due to the high levels of coritsal (stress hormones) in reaction to the high testosterone and insulin resistence. I also experienced metabolic inflammation (non alcoholic fatty liver disease), skin inflammation (as I mentioned earlier the ezcema on my scalp, alopecia, and hirsutism), adipose tissue inflammation, chronic low grade inflammation (this led to edema or fuid retention -> insulin resistance and my high testosteron/androgen levels also exacerbated this).\n\nTo fix this these were the thin I added to my life:\n\n* Dry brushing 2-3 times a week\n* Body Gua sha\n* Face Gua Sha or Face Yoga or Myofascial Massage \n* Jump Rope\n* Trampoline/Rebounder\n* Vibration Plate (very useful for after a workout or while sitting down)\n* Acupressure mat\n* Arvigo (Mayan Abdominal massage) & Lymphatic drainage massage\n* Leg elevation, I sleep with a pillow under my knees. In the evenings I keep my legs up.\n* Massages\n* Sweat more (exercise/sauna/steam room)\n* Portable Infrared Sauna (reduce cortisol by 25%)\n* Microcurrent\n* Compression socks\n* Castor oil pack 3-4x per week\n* Eliminate inflammatory triggers (mine were gluten & dairy)\n   * Switch to sourdough\n   * Eliminate seed oils\n   * Avoid alcohol & smoking\n* Supplements\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n* Teas that helped\n   * Turmeric\n   * Red Rasberru Leaf Tea\n   * Fennel\n   * Chamomile\n\n# Gut Health \n\nYour microbiota needs the right bacteria in the right amount to perform its hormone regulating functions properly. When the type or number of bacteria gets disturbed by events such as stress, or poor diet, or your gut can no longer accomplish its job meaning you'll have inflammation, increased risk of chronic disease, skin conditions, mental health issues, weakened immune system, nutrient absorprion problems, and weight management challenges.   \n\n\nFor weight loss issues, gut microbiomes influence hormones in producing and signaling leptin and ghrelin (these hormones regulate hunger and fullness signals). Inflammation and insulin resistence is also associated with gut health problems as mentioned before. Energy extraction from foods, certain gut bacteria are more efficient at extracting energy from food, particularly carbohydrates. When there is an imbalance, more calories can be absorbed from food leading to difficulties gaining or losing weight. \n\nThings I did to improve gut health/intestinal permeability:\n\n* Ate foods rich in digestive enzymes (mangoes, pineapple, etc.)\n* Pre and probiotics (incorporate bifidobacterium and lactobacillus)\n   * Favorite brand: Seed Heath Probiotics\n* Pickles (without vinegar): Great source of prebiotics\n* Apple Cider Vinegar/Kimchi/Kombucha/Sauerkraut\n   * Beware of certain types of vinegar contain chemicals which kill bacteria, “the good bacteria”, and leave the yeast Candida albicans alone.\n   * Raw apple cider vinegar contains: Natural probiotics (friendly bacteria), which may help with your immune system and gut health.\n      * Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (diluted in a glass of water) before each meal\n   * Balsamic vinegar: Acetic acid is the active compound in balsamic vinegar. This acid contains strains of probiotics that aid digestion. The probiotics found in acetic acid can help promote good gut health and digestion while supporting overall immune function.\n* Raw Carrots (has the type of fiber that binds and flushes out toxins in gut, good to have as daily hormone & digestion support)\n* Limit Processed foods and Sugar\n* No drinking or smoking \n* Stress managment (which I'll expand on just below)\n* Increase fiber intake\n* Regularly exercise\n* Supplements\n   * Ginger \n   * L-Glutamine\n   * Olive leaf extract (especially helpful if you have candida overgrowth)\n   * Turmereric \n* Teas\n   * Ginger\n   * Lemon Balm\n\n# Lower androgens/testosterone\n\n* Teas \n   * Nettle Tea\n   * Spearmint tea\n* Spearmint oil topically for hirsutism\n* Supplements\n   * Schisandra (adaptogen - stress management & hormone balance)\n   * Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n   * Inositol\n   * Holy Basil\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\n# Nervous System Regulation/ Stress Management \n\nStress is one of the things that age us the most, and people with PCOS already have higher levels of cortisol so these are the things I do to manage my stress levels:\n\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, direct sunlight upon waking up. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Same bedtime everynight (pre midnight)\n* Invert screen colors at bedtime (red filter on screens)\n* Pillow under knees\n* No loud alarms\n* Magnesium biglycinate supplement before bed\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, view the sunset before bed. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Spend a few minutes breathing through left nostril only\n* Epsom salt foot soak\n* Journal\n* Get back to using my coloring books (I even invested in alcohol based markers it's so fun). Regulates me and gets me in touch with my inner child\n* Time with friends, my puppy, and my family\n* Supplements\n   * Holy Basil (adaptogen - stress management & hormonal balance)\n   * L-Theanine\n   * Magnesium biglycinate \n* Teas\n   * Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen - stress management, also good for menstrual cramps)\n   * Reishi Mushroom\n   * Lemon Balm\n* Night time mocktail (have after dinner and not on an empty stomach due to the sugar levels in the tart cherry)\n   * Teaspoon of tart cherry (high levels of melatonin)\n   * Magnesium biglycinate powder\n   * Probiotic soda (good for gut health)\n\n# Tea cycling\n\n- On your period\n    - Nettle leaf: Increase iron levels\n    - Moringa: Increase iron levels\n    - Red Raspberry leaf: Helps with period cramps (best to drink throughout the month, especially at the end of the luteal phase\n    - Chamomile: Helps with wellness wind down routine when you're feeling extra tired\n- Follicular phase\n    - Focus teas: Peppermint, Spearmint\n    - Adaptogens: Lion's mane, Adaptogen latte, and Chaga mushroom\n    - Detox: Dandelion Root\n- Ovulation phase\n    - Detox: Dandelion root tea\n    - Bloating: turmeric tea latte/golden latte\n    - Estrogen dominance - symptoms (bad hormonal migraines, hot flashes, nausea): Schisandra berry, Lemon balm\n- Luteal phase\n    - PMS symptoms: Raspberry leaf, Schisandra berry, Ginger root (powder or tea)\n\n\nThe best teas for PCOS\n\n- Spearmint\n    - For reducing androgens & lowering hirsutism (facial hair)\n- Cinnamon tea (improves insulin sensitivity)\n- Chamomile tea (Adaptogen)\n- Nettle Tea (reduce androgens)\n- Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen/stress relief, also good for menstrual cramps)\n- Schisandra (adaptogen/stress relief & hormone balance)\n- Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n- Ginger (ginger offers anti-inflammatory, fertility and hormone-balancing benefits, aides digestion )\n\n\n# Seed Cycling\n\nWhat is seed cycling? Seed cycling refers to the consumption of specific seeds at different times of the month in order to improve the production and levels of sex hormones, specifically estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.\n\nSeed cycling divides the female menstrual cycle into two parts:\n\n1. During the first half of the menstrual cycle, or days 1 through 14, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **flax and pumpkin seeds.**\n2. During the second half of the menstrual cycle, or days 15 through 28, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **sunflower and sesame seeds**\n\n*Results from seed cycling will not happen overnight. Normally women observe improvements after approximately three months of seed cycling adherence. It took me about 4ish months.*\n\n**The Benefits of Seed Cycling:** Support hormonal balance, alleviate PMS symptoms, decrease hormonal acne, alter irregularity of menstrual cycles, and fight stomach bloating and fatigue.\n\n",

    "body": "My hair routine that transformed my hair\n\nHair routine:\n\n* Pre shampoo - I apply either ***Rosemary oil*** or ***Glycolic acid*** once weekly on my scalp. ***Coconut oil*** every wash day in my mid to ends hair length. \n\n* Wash - I typically use ***Dove intensive repair shampoo and conditioner*** almost every wash day, ***Ketocononazole 2%*** once weekly, and ***K18 detox shampoo*** as my clarifying shampoo once weekly. massage using scalp brush for a minute \n              \n* Hair mask - ***K18 leave in molecular repair hair mask*** once weekly after using mg clarifying shampooing. I leave it on for 4 mins then followed with any conditioner. On weekdays, I use ***fino hair mask or hot oil treatment*** once weekly followed with conditoner. \n\n* Use a microfiber hair towel to dry - I find that this cut my drying time in half\n\n* Scalp care - As of now, I use ***Kerastase anti hair fall fortifying serum*** every wash day\n\n* Leave in treatment - Post K18 hair mask, I use ***Living Proof triple bond complex***. When I’m not, ***Aveda strengthening leave in treatment*** followed with ***Pureology fanatic leave in conditioner*** \n\n* Blow dry using dyson\n\n* Serum/ oils - Every morning, i apply ***Kerastase elixir ultime*** while every night, i apply ***Kerastase 8h magic night serum*** \n\n* Use of silk pillow case and silk bonnet \n\n* Now, twice weekly ( usually i schedule it every Monday and Friday) I would use ***L’oreal ever pure glossing shampoo, acidic glaze and conditioner*** , ***Color wow money masque*** in the shower. post shower while my hair is still damp, I spray ***Color wow supernatural dream coat*** then blow dry. Athis ensure na shiny all week hair ko since these effect would last for 3 shampoos. \n\nI know, I know ang complicated but i finally find what works for my hair. \n\nFor context, I used to be kulot growing up kaya nickname ko dati was *negra* back when di pa uso maging PC. Then naging wavy sya during my teens kaya madalas ako mag pa rebond nun. *Cue horror* I still remember the days i would straightened my hair while kinda damp back in HS! Di pa uso heat protectant nun. Then nung nauso ung keratin treatment, i would go for it every 6 months para ma tame and dry frizzy hair ko. After 6 months, my hair would go *poof its coco crunch* lol. \n\nDagdag pa na i started having severe hair fall on my 4th month post partum. So *icky* the hair fall na every wash day i have to pick up my hair from the shower drain *shudder* and vacuum ung floor twice a day. \n\n\nSo, nagumpisa sa rosemary oil when i saw that it trended on IG for hair growth then stumbling on **Abbey Yung** on IG. So i started using almost everything she recommended for a month and then here my hair, at my healthiest era. 🥹\n\nI last had my keratin treatment 9 months ago. And it looks like i just had done the treatment plus my hair fall woes are no more. Even my husband complimented ny hair which caught me off guard since when do men ever notice hair 🙄 plus even my colleague was shocked na it’s all natural.\n\nI would say, i now have fine hair either 1A/1B low porosity. This is my ultimate greatest achievement of the year 😂",

    "body": "I’ve been struggling with hair loss for the past four years. From the beginning, I was determined to figure out the root cause and fix it naturally. I went all in: had every blood test imaginable, saw an endocrinologist, got a pelvic ultrasound for PCOS, and even had a colonoscopy and endoscopy to check for nutrient absorption issues. I also worked with a naturopath for over two years and followed every protocol they gave me.\n\nI tried so many things; supplements, rosemary oil, derma-stamping, 10 sessions of PRP, and even bought a red light helmet. I’ve spent tens of thousands of dollars trying to fix this, but nothing helped.\n\nI had read so many positive stories about spironolactone and minoxidil and knew deep down that they would probably work. But I kept trying to avoid going on medication, especially something that could be a lifelong commitment.\n\nThe mental toll was intense. I cried almost every day, constantly obsessed over my hair, and it really started to take over my life. It was making me miserable.\n\nEventually, I reached a point where I just couldn’t take it anymore. I got a prescription for 100mg of spironolactone and started using 5% men’s Rogaine (minoxidil). I’ve already seen a noticeable improvement. My hair feels fuller, shedding has slowed, and I finally feel hopeful again.\n\nI truly wish I had started sooner. I’m not thrilled that this may be a long-term routine, but it’s worth it for the sake of my mental health and peace of mind. I’m looking forward to seeing how things improve over the next year.\n\nIf you’re on the fence, I completely understand. Just know that you’re not alone, and sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself is choose what helps you feel better, even if it wasn’t your first plan.",

I have been doing prp, taking biotin and vitamin D and I apply minoxidil 2% once in a day (not twice as they say it's best) but 3 times a week because it's not sustainable. They make hair extremely oily so you cannot go out and work in this condition. I think minoxidil does not work for me, I never had any shed and also I don't see baby hairs. I see only improvement in density and I think this is due to prp, so I am continuing with that given that I pay for it in a very affordable price. I am afraid of taking oral minoxidil due to side effects. I don't know. I don't see substantial progress, I just see that the problem is camouflaged because density is better. How is applying minoxidil everyday sustainable for you? Do you wash your hair everyday? My dermatologist told me it should be forbidden to do so and that I should wash my hair every 2-3 days, not every day.",

Please visit your healthcare specialist.)\n\nHair loss is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Understanding its causes, treatments, and prevention methods can help you take control of your hair health. In this comprehensive guide, we will discuss various factors contributing to hair loss, different hair loss conditions, their effective treatments, and other steps you can take to maintain healthy hair.\n\n# What factors can cause hair loss?\n\n1. **Genetic Factors:** Hereditary hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is the most common cause of hair loss. It affects both men and women and is characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair.\n2. **Hormonal Imbalances:** Hormonal fluctuations due to pregnancy, menopause, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can lead to hair loss.\n3. **Nutritional Factors:** A balanced diet is crucial for hair health. Deficiencies in nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B vitamins can contribute to hair loss.\n4. **Medical Conditions:** Thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases like alopecia areata, and scalp infections can cause hair loss.\n5. **Medications and Treatments:** Certain medications and treatments, including chemotherapy, can lead to temporary or permanent hair loss.\n6. **Stress:** Both physical and emotional stress can cause hair loss by triggering telogen effluvium, a temporary hair-shedding condition.\n\n# Identifying your type of hair loss\n\nThere are many hair loss types, and knowing which one you have can be very beneficial when treating it.\n\nFirst, it's essential to understand the difference between androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness) and non-androgenetic alopecia (non-pattern hair loss).\n\nThe former affects men and women differently - men generally have a receding hairline at their temples, while women tend to experience general thinning throughout the scalp.\n\nThe latter includes rarer forms, such as alopecia totalis (total scalp baldness), alopecia universalis (total body baldness), and telogen effluvium (i.e. brief shedding after childbirth or major surgery).\n\n# How to treat your hair condition?\n\nThis is designed so you know the most effective treatments for each condition. This is by no means an exhaustive list, it's just a list of the most popular ones.\n\n# Receding hairline\n\nA receding hairline is a common condition that affects millions of men worldwide, typically caused by heredity, hormones, aging, and other factors. The condition usually appears in males between 30 and 40 years old.\n\n# Symptoms of a receding hairline include:\n\n* Thinning or balding on the top of the head\n* Widening part line and sparse hair on the temples\n* Itchy, flaky scalp\n* Patches of thicker, darker hair or bald spots near the back of the scalp where new hairs do not grow\n* Increased shedding from other parts of the body, such as eyebrows and eyelashes\n* Weaker or finer hair on the scalp leading to breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for a receding hairline:\n\n1. Essential oils: Natural treatment options like peppermint oil, rosemary oil, and lavender oil can help stimulate blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy scalp conditions. Massage these oils into the scalp twice daily for the best results.\n2. Minoxidil: This over-the-counter medication can be applied directly to the scalp to promote the growth of new hairs in areas affected by receding hairlines. Use minoxidil as directed for optimal results.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment: PRP therapy involves drawing a patient's blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting the platelets into the scalp. This treatment can promote hair growth but may be expensive and suitable only for some individuals.\n\n# Male Pattern Baldness (MPB):\n\nMale pattern baldness is a common form of hair loss among men caused by genetic and hormonal factors. It usually begins with the thinning of hair on the temples and crown of the head, resulting in a receding hairline or bald spots. In some cases, it can even lead to complete baldness.\n\n# Symptoms of male pattern baldness:\n\n* Gradual thinning of hair at the crown or top of the head\n* Receding hairline around the temples and a generally sparse appearance\n* Increased shedding\n* Excessive oiliness or dryness of the scalp\n* Irritation or inflammation\n* In advanced cases, bald spots may form on the scalp or forehead\n\n# Recommended treatments for male pattern baldness:\n\n1. Medications: Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are both available to treat male pattern baldness. Minoxidil can be applied directly to the scalp twice a day to promote hair growth, while finasteride is a pill that reduces the production of DHT, the hormone linked to male pattern baldness.\n2. Hair Transplants: Hair transplants involve removing healthy hair follicles from the back or sides of the head and implanting them into areas where hair has been lost. This surgical solution can be successful but costly and may not be suitable for everyone.\n3. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Alopecia Areata:\n\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face, and other parts of the body. The immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to hair loss in small, round patches.\n\n# Symptoms of alopecia areata (continued):\n\n* Sudden onset of one or more round, smooth patches of hair loss on the scalp or other body parts\n* The skin in these areas is usually not inflamed or scaly\n* Scaling and inflammation on the scalp\n* Dandruff-like flaking\n* Hair loss on other areas of the body, such as the beard or eyebrows\n* Sometimes, the affected area may have a burning or itchy sensation\n\n# Recommended treatments for alopecia areata:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroids: These medications help reduce inflammation in the scalp and promote hair regrowth. Intralesional corticosteroids may also be used for this purpose.\n2. Medications like minoxidil and anthralin can help promote hair regrowth in some individuals.\n3. Scalp-cooling caps or cold caps can be used to reduce inflammation and improve the effectiveness of topical corticosteroids.\n4. Immunotherapy: This treatment stimulates an immune response to promote hair regrowth and may be beneficial for some people with alopecia areata.\n\n# Telogen Effluvium:\n\nTelogen effluvium is a temporary increase in hair shedding caused by various factors, such as stress, illness, surgery, or significant weight loss. Hair shedding typically occurs 2-3 months after the triggering event and can last for several months before resolving.\n\n# Symptoms of telogen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid, noticeable thinning or shedding of scalp hair\n* Excessive amounts of hair in the shower drain or on pillows after sleeping\n* Small \"peach fuzz\" hairs on the scalp\n* Visible scalp through thinning hair\n* Itching, burning, or redness of the scalp\n* Loss of eyebrows or eyelashes in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for telogen effluvium:\n\n1. Address the underlying cause: Treat hormonal imbalances or nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to hair loss. This may involve taking medications or supplements to balance hormones and provide essential nutrients.\n2. Stress management: Practice relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation to help reduce stress levels.\n3. Medications: Prescription medications like minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia) can help reverse telogen effluvium by promoting hair growth.\n4. Hair transplant: In some cases, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair due to telogen effluvium. This involves removing healthy follicles from the back of the head and transplanting them to areas of thinning or baldness.\n5. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is recommended for early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including telogen effluvium. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n\n# Anagen Effluvium:\n\nAnagen effluvium is a type of hair loss caused by an interruption to the normal growth cycle of the hair follicle. This can occur when the cells producing new hairs are damaged or destroyed, leading to rapid hair shedding. Chemotherapy treatments, some medications, certain medical conditions, and nutritional deficiencies can trigger anagen effluvium.\n\n# Symptoms of anagen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid hair loss, usually within 2 to 4 weeks after the triggering event\n* Hair thinning, with a reduction in overall hair volume\n* Patches of baldness on the scalp or other areas of the body where hair is present\n* Brittle, easily broken hair\n* An itchy, scaly scalp or lesions on the scalp or other body areas with hair loss\n* Eyebrows and eyelashes may be affected in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for anagen effluvium:\n\n1. Minoxidil: This topical medication can be applied directly to the scalp to help stimulate hair growth and reduce hair loss.\n2. Steroid injections: Corticosteroid injections can help suppress scalp inflammation and promote hair regrowth.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: This treatment involves taking a blood sample from the patient and injecting it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth.\n4. Hair transplantation: For severe cases of anagen effluvium, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair. The hair follicles are taken from another area of the scalp and implanted in the affected area.\n5. Hair Nutrient Tablets by Scandinavian Biolabs: These multivitamins are enriched with essential nutrients like zinc, riboflavin, and other vitamins that support healthy hair growth.\n\n# Traction Alopecia:\n\nTraction alopecia is hair loss caused by prolonged, constant tension on the scalp. It can occur from hairstyles that pull too tightly on the follicles, such as tight buns, braids, and ponytails. Traction alopecia is commonly seen in African Americans, but anyone can be affected by it.\n\n# Symptoms of traction alopecia:\n\n* Thinning hair and bald patches in areas repeatedly exposed to tight hairstyles\n* Tenderness or burning sensations on the scalp and itching\n* Inflammation or open sores (known as folliculitis) due to excessive tension placed on the hair follicles\n* Hair loss may spread beyond the initial area of damage, and other scalp issues, such as scarring or infections, may occur\n\n# Recommended treatments for traction alopecia:\n\n1. Removal of the cause: Avoid activities that cause excess tension on the scalp, such as tight hairstyles or clips. Wearing protective hairstyles, like loose braids or ponytails, can help prevent traction alopecia from reoccurring.\n2. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including traction alopecia. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n3. Essential oil massage: Massaging the scalp with essential oils like lavender and rosemary can help stimulate hair growth. Alternatively, try a [hair protection oil](https://scandinavianbiolabs.com/products/hair-protection-oil) – a blend of essential and beneficial oils designed to revitalize your hair.\n4. Maintain a healthy diet: Ensuring a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle can improve the overall health of the scalp and hair. If left untreated, traction alopecia can lead to permanent baldness.\n\n# Scalp Psoriasis\n\nScalp psoriasis is a prevalent skin condition that affects millions of people globally. It is characterized by red, scaly patches on the scalp, leading to itching, burning, discomfort, and even hair loss. By understanding the symptoms and recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis, you can better manage this condition and reduce its impact on your hair health.\n\n# Symptoms of scalp psoriasis:\n\nDepending on the severity, symptoms of scalp psoriasis can vary. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Itchy, scaly patches on the scalp\n* Redness and inflammation\n* Thick, silvery scales or plaques that may appear as large patches\n* Hair loss in patchy areas\n* Burning or soreness\n* Stiffness in the scalp\n* Flaking skin that may appear on clothes or furniture\n\n# Recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis:\n\n1. Topical medications: corticosteroids, calcipotriol, coal tar products, dithranol, and salicylic acid.\n2. Oral or injected medications: to control inflammation and reduce scaling.\n3. Light therapy: beneficial for scalp psoriasis alone or combined with topical medications.\n4. Lifestyle changes: stress reduction, diet improvement, and regular exercise to reduce flare-ups.\n5. Self-care measures: avoid scratching the scalp, and use gentle shampoos designed for scalp psoriasis.\n\n# Trichotillomania\n\nTrichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is a psychological condition marked by a recurrent urge to pull out one's hair. This behavior can lead to noticeable hair thinning, patchy baldness, or even complete hair loss in severe cases.\n\n# Symptoms of trichotillomania\n\nCommon symptoms associated with trichotillomania include:\n\n* Obsessive thoughts or urges to pull out hair\n* Feelings of tension before and relief after hair-pulling\n* Frequent playing with, twirling, or rubbing pulled-out hair\n* Inability to resist hair-pulling in specific situations or when experiencing certain emotions\n* Noticeable bald patches on the scalp and other areas of the body\n* Emotional distress related to hair-pulling, such as guilt or shame\n* Excessive grooming behaviors leading to hair loss, such as over-combing or brushing\n* Feelings of satisfaction when looking at pulled-out hair\n* Using techniques to disguise bald patches, such as wearing hats or frequently changing hairstyles\n\n# Recommended treatments for trichotillomania\n\n1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): helps identify and modify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contributing to hair-pulling urges.\n2. Medications: antidepressants or antipsychotics to reduce hair-pulling urges and relieve symptoms.\n3. Habit Reversal Training (HRT): a type of CBT that helps identify and modify hair-pulling behaviors.\n4. Support Groups: provide a safe place to share experiences, build coping skills, and reduce stigma.\n\n# Female Pattern Baldness\n\nFemale pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia, is a common type of hair loss affecting millions of women worldwide. It usually begins in the 40s and can continue until menopause. The primary cause is an excess of androgens or male hormones, which causes hair follicles to shrink, leading to thinning hair on the scalp.\n\n# Symptoms of female pattern baldness\n\nCommon signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Gradual thinning on top of the head\n* Receding hairline, especially at temples\n* Widening of the center hair part\n* Increased hair shedding on a pillow in the morning\n* An overall decrease in scalp coverage\n* Visible bald patches (in advanced cases)\n* Hair shedding or breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for female pattern baldness\n\n1. Medications: Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are commonly used to treat female pattern baldness. Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), while minoxidil promotes hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp.\n2. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a non-invasive treatment shown to reduce hair loss and promote new hair growth in some women. It uses low-intensity lasers to stimulate the scalp, increasing circulation and encouraging follicles to enter the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle.\n3. Hair Transplant Surgery: This procedure involves transplanting healthy hair from an area of the scalp with thicker hair to balding areas. The transplanted hairs will grow naturally in the new location, providing a permanent solution to female pattern baldness.\n4. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Hairline Recession & Thinning at The Crown\n\nHairline recession and thinning at the crown can be distressing for many people, especially those who had a full head of hair in their younger years. This issue affects both men and women but is more common in men.\n\n# Symptoms of hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n* Widening of the central and frontal hair part line\n* Visible scalp on forehead, temples, or crown areas\n* Reduced amount of hairs in specific areas\n* An overall decrease in fullness and body of hair along the parting line\n* Widening of the scalp line with a receding hairline\n* Hair loss in patches, mainly on the crown area\n* Breakage or shedding hairs along the parting lines or around the crown area\n\n# Recommended treatments for hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n1. Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a topical medication applied directly to the scalp, available in over-the-counter and prescription formulas. It stimulates hair growth and makes existing hairs stronger and thicker.\n2. Finasteride: This medication is taken orally, usually once a day, and works to block the production of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a significant contributing factor in male pattern baldness.\n3. Platelet-rich Plasma Therapy: Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) is a treatment that uses the patient's blood to stimulate hair growth. It injects the patient's plasma, containing high platelets and other healing factors, directly into the scalp.\n4. Hair Transplant: A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves transferring hair follicles from one part of the scalp to another. It can treat hairline recession and thinning at the crown.\n5. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a newer form of treatment that uses light energy to stimulate hair growth. The lasers are typically painless and can treat both men and women experiencing hair loss.",

Then start doing sports ( any activity like yoga or pilates will do , walk more )Drink more water , sleep well , calm down your nerves. You need herb medications to bust your blood flow , to increase metabolism. Coconut oil mixed with ginger or red pepper or turmeric will only make your hair greasy and your scalp itchy . I tried it believe me . Nicotinic acid works a little  because it makes your blood flow betterIts  . It’s never a bad idea to consult a professional therapist . He can give individual recommendations which will work for you. For example Ashvagandha and Horsetail worked well for me . But if doesn’t mean that it will suit your dosha type.

Sure you will find an article that confirms it's efficacy but 90% of hair loss is AGA. Saw palmetto, caffeine shampoo, cosmetics oils have NO effect in treating it.   \n\n\nVitamins will only help if hair loss is caused by malnutrition (which is not AGA), but most of us, especially in the West, are not vitamin deficient (pregnant women, drug addicts and alcoholist excluded). Vitamin D deficiency is quite common though, but it's role in hair loss currently unclear.",

Since 2020 I’ve battled this and I’ve LOST FOR THE LAST 4.5 years, only the last 6 months have I actually made insane progress. I’ve gotten all the blood work, I’m perfectly healthy and nothing medical points to my hair loss. I think (pretty much know) it’s stress related. Any time since 2020 that I have had a major stressful event (quarantine to begin with) I lose more and more hair. The last 8 months I got my shit together and decided I was done with hiding the top of my head and I needed to be DEDICATED to growing my hair back. I scalp massage with rosemary oil every time I shower so pretty much every/ every other day, have been religiously taking nutrafol, do not use any heat other than cool setting to dry my hair, and I STOPPED DYEING MY HAIR. My hair grows super light naturally and I’ve been dyeing it jet black or super dark brown since 14. The grow out of dark hair made my bald spots a million times worse and that would cause me to dye more in an attempt to cover them. I decided I HAD TO grow it out completely if I ever wanted healthy hair. I have like 5 inches of new healthy growth on the top and an insane amount of baby hairs at my hairline and nape of my neck. The crown of my head is pretty much completely filled in and the relief I feel from this is so insane. Anyone else dealing with this- I FEEL U AND I AM SENDING U SO MUCH BABY HAIR ENERGY. We can all get through this 😭🩷",

The other issue is what if you don't conceive straight away and it takes a long time? Are you going to stay off meds for 12 months plus? Likely a death sentence for your hair.\nI have previously ceased oral finasteride for 3 months on 2 separate occasions and not used anything during that period, I personally didn't notice any changes in my hair, I have seen studies that seem to show if you have been on finasteride for a long time it takes a lot longer to completely clear out of your system, its not quite as straightforward as the half life would suggest so that's another thing to consider.  The other option is possibly switch to a topical Finasteride and minoxidil solution if you are concerned about taking the pills as that would be less likely to affect anything, just a thought 👍",

Somehow, i reversed my loss fairly quickly ( I didn't feel like it at the time cause I was pretty much bald on my crown and mid scalp and grew impatient due to the fact that i would have been so much farther along had a doctor not refused me a finasteride prescription).\n\nmoral of the story is, keep up with a good lifestyle and reduce stress and don't introduce stressors into your life such as cigs, liquor, insomnia etc. You probably will hold on to your gains for a while if you do that, but maybe not.

    "body": "I use suave clarifying shampoo whenever my hair isn’t reacting to the products as well as usual, which is like once a week. I wash with literally any shampoo two or three times every other day. If it’s not foaming EVERYWHERE then I know my hair is still oily/dirty. I wish I could wash it less but I work in a kitchen so it gets pretty dirty pretty fast. Then I get hair soaking wet, put a pump of mielle conditioner in it, leave while I soap up everythang else and shave. Then I SOAK my hair and flip upside down and finger comb. Then I rake through more conditioner, making sure my hair is still absolutely soaking. Then I prayer hands my hair into one big clump, then shake my head a little while still upside down to get some natural curl clumps to form. While still 100% soaked (adding more water if not the whole time) I scrunch in Garnier Fructis air dry curl cream. Like a quarter sized amount. Then scrunch in like two palm fulls of mousse— whatever’s cheapest honestly. \nThen I flip everything right side up and add a little more water (all of this is still in the shower), and scrunch where I want it to fall. Your hair will dry exactly how it looks when it is wet, so if it is frizzy while wet, you didn’t use enough water/conditioner. Then I let air dry from drippin wet. Don’t towel dry or touch it or anything. Takes my hair like two-three hours to dry but tooooootally worth it. If I’m feeling cute I’ll use some rosemary oil straight on my scalp just to encourage fast growth, but that doesn’t affect looks. \n",

I went to one a few weeks ago to get my see through length dealt with (you can see the result in my post history) and they did a good job but for everything that requires only a really small trim, you either have to *really* trust your hairdresser or risk much more getting chopped than you want, like you unfortunately just experienced.",

Today, I suffer with hair loss, low energy, dry eyes, etc. It’s caused some major dents in my self confidence. I should also mention I work from home. \n\nI had a doctor’s appointment recently for something unrelated and something was telling me that I should request a vitamin D test - so I did. I got the results back and I am severely deficient in vitamin D. The normal range is 30-100 ng/mL. Mine was 8.9. I was wondering why changing my hair products and incorporating rosemary oil and everything under the sun wasn’t doing anything. Turns out that the problem was from the inside. \n\nDefinitely going to be taking my supplements religiously and spending more time under the sun. Best of luck everyone!\n\nEDIT: I got prescribed 50,000 IU",

Vitamin D insufficiency causes calcium dysregulation and follicular arrest in women with PCOS, which is connected to menstrual irregularities and fertility issues. ”\n\n”The effect of Vitamin D on the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions associated with PCOS may be mediated by an overall impact on insulin resistance. Vitamin D supplementation improved menstrual periods, increased folliculogenesis, and decreased blood testosterone levels in PCOS patients, all of which had a significant impact on the ability to procreate. As a result, it might be a cutting-edge therapeutic strategy for treating PCOS concurrently.”\n\nhttps://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2023/07000/vitamin_d_and_polycystic_ovary_syndrome__pcos___a.39.aspx",

I wanted to give an update on my hair regrowth - if you want to read the backstory I kindly refer you to my first post for the details.\n\nImages: The first two pictures are the current state, wet and dried with light shining on my head from above. The others are progress pictures during the year, ending with the very first one.\n\nQuick Recap: \nI am 23 years old, started balding at 17/18, was desperate, got a hair piece, dumped it, lost a bunch of hair, now regrowing it. Started October 2023.\n\n(Updated) Treatment Plan:\n* 2x 50mg/ml Topical Minoxidil, morning and evening\n* 1x 1mg Oral Finasteride, morning\n* (NEW) Topical Rosemary Oil, 15min before shower, every Sunday, Wednesday\n* (NEW) Silicone Head Massager, every Shower\n\nAdditional Supplements:\n* 2x Caps ESN Kreatine\n* 2x Caps ESN Athlete Stack\n\nSupporting Lifestyle Habits:\n* Ending every shower cold\n* Gym four times a week\n* General healthy diet\n* 3L Water a day\n* High Protein Diet (170g per day)\n\nSide Effects:\n* Somewhat dry/itchy scalp, rosemary oil and hydrating shampoo improved that\n\nNow some more insight, and coming down to reality: As I mentioned in my last post, I tried growing out my hair. But unfortunately I realized that my hair is still to weak/thin to look good long. After trying it for a couple of weeks I committed to the old clean fade buzzcut, which I have gotten quite used to and now love. When the light shines in the right angle, you can still make out my scalp a little, but its quite minimal. When my hair is wet, it still quite obvious I have hair-loss. Never the less, I am extremely happy where I am at - when I turn 30yo I will probably let nature takes it course.\n\nAll the best for my fellow hair-loss gents! \nCheers! 🥃 ",

    "body": "Treatment: 1mg of fin daily.\n\nWhat’s up y’all. I had made it a point to not overly obsess with progress, or lack there of, so I didn’t take pictures in between. And I know it’s easier for me to say since I had a lot of hair to start with but after a very stressful two years I seemed to have experienced some sort of shock loss and that’s what spurred me to look into and begin treatment. My hair has always been a big part of my identity so I’ve always tried to take good care of it. \n\nMy expectations were very tempered as far as treatment went. I at the very least hoped to hold onto what I had. If any regrowth occurred then I’d consider that a bonus. Anyways today I ran out of my 12 month fin prescription which means that I hit the year mark so I decided to post the before and after. \n\nFirst two are January 24 and late December 23. The last two are from today.\n\nOutside of the somewhat watery semen I haven’t experienced any other sides. I got a subscription for a fin/min topical product but I read about the toxic effect min has on cats so I never once tried it. I did rosemary oil for about a month or two but since I have longer curly hair I only wash once a week so it didn’t seem like it would be useful. That said I’m going to try and wash twice a week or every 5 days and use it right before each shower just to see. I also tried vitamin C and saw palmetto. The research on the palmetto was dicey so I just stopped taking it because I didn’t want to burden my stomach for a gamble. I also bought a stamp and roller but again my scalp would have been clean once a week for me to do that and it just didn’t seem like I’d be able to do it in sufficient volume for it to make a difference. But I still have them so who knows. Maybe if I experience more loss I’ll incorporate that in my routine.\n\nBesides that I exercise regularly. I transitioned to kettlebells this year so I do that and calisthenics. My diet is normal. I mostly cook all my meals. I used to be a huge gym rat so I’ve kept the habit of healthy meals. But I do also indulge myself so I’m not extremely militant about what i eat. I just strive for a good balance of nutrition and pleasure. I also work from home 90% of the time so my stress has been limited. No commuting stress, I sleep as much as my body needs, I eat at home most of the time, I’m in a comfortable environment so that also is a factor.\n\nSo that’s all I can think of for now. Feel free to drop a question and I’ll try my best to address it. And yes I’m definitely continuing treatment. I’m picking up the refill for the next 90 days later today.\n\nCheers y’all ",

It also ends up hindering your ability to fall into deep REM sleep which was making me lethargic so that also played into me quitting.

He said if i wanted i could try oral minoxidil but id honestly rather try dutasteride and see what dutasteride can bring to the table for me because i really am scared of the hair shedding because it is really hard keep my hair longer so no one can see my bald spot. You can see it sometimes when my hair isnt covering the loss in my crown i have a post on my account if anyone can check it out pls and comment that would be great and id really appreciate it.

    "body": "I feel like I see an iteration of this exact same post every day or so on this sub, so I thought I’d offer a (long but) simple explanation for why your perfectly healthy hair can’t seem to grow past a certain length, no matter how well you care for it.\n\nThe explanation is this: each hair strand, from each little follicle, only grows for a certain amount of time.  Not to a certain length, not until the hair strand weighs a certain amount (??), but for a certain, specific amount of time.  The maximum length that a person’s hair can reach is equal to the maximum amount of hair length that their follicles produce per month multiplied by the maximum number of months that their hair will produce more length. After that, the follicle pauses growth, sheds the old strand, rests for a bit, and begins producing hair again. \n\nIf you had, say, shoulder-length hair, and your goal is to grow it to waist length, then you need to grow a foot or so of hair, depending on your height, to achieve your goal.  (I’m going to use some nice round numbers here because it’s all individual anyway and I’m not getting up to get a measuring tape or a calculator.) So, you start your hair growth journey: you’re taking your vitamins, oiling your hair, assessing your shampoo and conditioner choices. You learn a few braids, learn about dusting and micro-trimming.  You wash your hair less often, then a little more often.  You own a silk pillowcase.  There’s rosemary oil everywhere. \n\nLet’s say that your hair grows, on average, 0.5”/month (because that makes the math easy). Let’s also say that you have a hair trimmer angel whom you trust implicitly: this sainted angel trims exactly 0.5” from your hair every six months because that’s all that’s necessary to keep it healthy because you’re taking such great care of it. \n\nBy this math, you should have healthy, lush waist length hair in a little less than 2.5 years, right?  0.5” x 30 months = 15” of growth – 2.5” trimmed = 12.5” of growth from shoulder length. \n\nSo why is your hair stuck around your mid-back, and why does it look so scraggly/thin/”unhealthy”? You took the vitamins.  You did all the rosemary oil.  You did hair masks.  You’re rinsing in cold water, where are the promised mermaid waves?? Are you just cursed with terrible genetics, doomed to return, shorn and dejected, to bob-land?\n\nActually, no, you are probably not cursed with terrible genetics.  You are probably not doing anything wrong, especially if you’ve been taking diligent care of your hair for 2.5 years.  \n\nHere’s the thing: Each of those strands that you’ve been oiling and babying has already been growing for its own individual length of time.  A blunt shoulder-length haircut includes strands at full length that are about two years old, give or take, and it could also include strands that have been growing for 5-7 years on the outside end of the range, that you’ve been trimming to shoulder length the entire time.  When you decide to grow out shoulder length hair, those older strands are still going to shed in their natural time.  They will never get as long as they would have, had they never been trimmed.  This means that, as some strands shed and others keep growing, the ends of your hair will naturally become thinner. \n\nYou can tell if you’re in this scraggly situation if you look at the ends of your hair and see that you’re losing considerable density toward the end, but the individual strands aren’t split, broken or otherwise unhealthy. \n\nAnd here’s the hard pill to swallow for those among us who want the fastest path possible to long, thick, healthy hair, emphasis on the LONG: the length of time that it will take for your hair to get both longer AND thicker with a full, juicy hemline is the length of time that it takes for your old, trimmed hair strands to shed, and then for all of your new-growth strands to sprout and travel down the growth path to your desired length.  Unfortunately, more and more strands will age while those new growth strands are traveling down your back, and then THEY will shed, and those follicles will start their own fresh new sprouts which will join the growth journey, etc., etc., and so goes the circle of life. \n\nThis fact is both comforting and frustrating.  Your hair isn’t unhealthy.  It's not breakage.  Biotin or folic acid won’t fix it.  Hair just naturally sheds, and if you’ve already trimmed three years of growth off of a hair strand, that strand is going to shed before it reaches the length that would have been its full potential length, had it not been trimmed.  Multiply this by the number of hairs that you have on your head that have been trimmed, and you can see why it’s going to take longer to grow long hair than it seems like it should take: you have to, essentially, give every trimmed hair the chance to shed, and then regrow with the minimum amount of trimming necessary to keep it healthy, to reach its full potential length and thickness. \n\nFortunately! Your hair will eventually get both longer and thicker.  It just takes time, probably more time than you think.  I think part of the frustration that people experience with their hair growth journeys is unrealistic expectations, either based on mis-information or on hair success stories from people with completely different heads of hair.\n\nFor the sake of a quick reality check, here are some factors that are going to mean that natural shedding has a much lower impact on someone’s hair growth journey:\n\n1)    They’re short.  A 5’ tall person’s hair doesn’t have to grow for as long a time to reach their waist as a 6’ tall person’s hair.\n\n2)    Their natural hair growth cycle is longer.\n\n3)    Their natural hair growth cycle is faster.\n\n4)    Their hair strands are thicker and/or they have greater hair density. \n\n5)    They have virgin, undyed, unbleached hair.  (I know this is a touchy subject, so I’m not going to go into it too much.  I’m not saying that it’s impossible to grow long hair and also use dye or bleach; I’m saying that mistakes can be made, care must be taken, and the growth journey will require some extra TLC.)\n\nIf any of those factors apply to you, you already know about it, I promise, no matter where you are in your hair growth journey.  If they don’t, then you’re probably already aware of that as well.  It doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with you, or that you’re making mistakes.  Frustratingly, it also doesn’t mean that there’s any action you can take or anything for you to fix.  It just means that you’ve got normal, ordinary, healthy hair that you’re taking great care of, that’s taking it’s sweet, genetic time to grow. \n\nAll of this is assuming that your health is relatively intact, your diet is ok, you and your doctor have your blood work under control, your hormones aren’t going through anything wonky, you’re not over-trimming, and you are, in fact, taking very good care of your hair, including regular protective hairstyles and not using bleach. \n\nSo what do you do if you just want long, healthy hair??\n\nAs in most cases, you get to choose from imperfect choices.  Think of it this way: you can have hair long, thick and quick, but you can only pick two.  If you want thicker hair quickly, chop it: you’ll have lush blunt ends in no time.  If you want long hair as quickly as possible, accept that it may be long, but it’s going to be thinner than it could be.  If you want long, thick hair, then settle in because that process isn’t quick. \n\nIt's not a one-size-fits-all, but I can share my personal situation for context. In September 2017 I got a 1” pixie cut.  Glad I tried it, not for me, started growing it out almost immediately.\n\n* Necessary context: I’m 5’8”, hair is medium density, thick strands, and it’s relatively strong and healthy.  It gets dry, but I’m not prone to split ends or breakage.  No dye or bleach. My hair grows an average of a little over 0.5”/month.\n* For two years, I trimmed the teensiest bit possible just for shape.  Otherwise I found ways to style it back and out of my way.\n* 2019 I trimmed an inch to even it out. The front still had some shorter parts, but it looked like a shoulder-length haircut. I started French braiding it daily at this point.\n* Not sure I trimmed it in 2020.  That was a weird year.\n* 2021 I trimmed maybe 2 inches over the course of the year. \n* By mid-2022 my hair was waist-length.  It was healthy, no split ends, but looking at pictures of it from the back, I could see that it wasn’t as dense toward the hemline. Small trims ensued. \n* I’ve maintained my hair length somewhere between waist and hip since that time, trimming here and there, with the goal of thickening my length all the way down.  Based on my average growth rate, it looks like I’ve got another year or so to go before my hair is fully thick to my hips. \n\nHere’s my $0.02 worth of advice, for exactly what it’s worth: baby your hair, grow it out to a length that’s longer, if not quite your goal length, and then let it rest at that length for a bit, trimming the ends, to give some more of your strands time to catch up. Then grow a little more, and then again rest and trim.  It’s a compromise.  It will take a little longer to reach your goal length, but you’ll probably enjoy the journey more.  If you grow it as fast as you possibly can, you run the risk of arriving at your goal length and deciding that long hair doesn’t suit you because it grows badly, gets thin, etc., when in reality your strands just needed a little more time to reach your goal together. \n\nOn the flip side, if you cave to reddit pressure and trim your perfectly healthy ends every time this sub declares hair with thinner ends to be scraggly, unhealthy, gross, unhygienic, “it looks damaged,” or whatever other judgy term we’re using these days to describe what may actually be perfectly healthy hair that’s just in an uneven stage of its growth process (<- all examples that I’ve seen, and sorry, this kind of judgmental commentary really bothers me), you risk taking far longer than necessary to reach your goal length.  I’ve seen several posts recently that look like Hair Hypochondria: there’s nothing wrong with the person’s hair, but they’re posting pictures asking how much to trim because the internet has convinced them that hair that varies in thickness down the length is “ugly.” \n\nOh, and learn to braid.  That really is my best hair growth tip.\n\nYour hair isn’t ugly.  It’s growing.  Keep taking care of it, oil it or wash it as you like, enjoy the hell out of that silk pillow case.  I just wanted to reassure everyone that your hair probably *can* grow longer than you think it can; it’s just going to take a lot longer than you think it will.   \n\n  \nEdit: stupid formatting",

What is a good technique or even a plan of attack when washing your long hair? Every time I wash mine it gets insanely tangled and when I detangle it with my fingers I end up with a ton of shed hair. I’m afraid I’m losing more than I should, like it’s breaking and not just natural shedding but can never tell when I look at the ends if it broke or not. So, is there a plan of attack that you use or like do you find washing you hair/scalp in a circular motion to tangle more of less? Maybe you put the top section in a claw clip while you wash the rest? I don’t know… I asked my stylist (yes I do have to have regular hair trims and coloring for my exceptionally conservative job) and he said it shouldn’t be an issue but something is up bc when he does it there aren’t any tangles.

(and received quite some flack for that) So here we go with some photos to match the consultants’ in the clinic. (Even got out the DSLR to bring the quality up to theirs)\n\nTo recap - I went for a HT transplant consult in November 2024, but was advised to go down the fin/min route first to see if a HT was really necessary, and also to stop the rot now! There are drawing marks on me to show what could be done, but obviously didn’t go ahead after his suggestion of topical treatment.\n\nSo this is 4+ months of generic compounded topical fin/min, 0.5ml, front and back, twice a day. (0.1% Fin, 5% Min, in TrichoSol) Also done random dermastamping, sometimes daily, but now backed off to weekly, previously 1.75mm, more recently back to 0.8-1mm. Some odd evenings I’ve used rosemary oil instead of fin/min (some evenings I did the rosemary oil 30 mins after the min/min), biotin pills regularly. I had an initial skin reaction when I started in late nov/early dec, so stopped for around 4 weeks, then started properly in Jan.\n\nNothing to promote here, all cheap stuff. The generic compounding chemist only charges £44 per 6 weeks ($60-ish). The hair in my consultation photos is much longer which is the crazy thing, really pleased with the results so far. I’ve put some markers on the pics, just because of some of the doubt from the last post of it being the same person.\n\nThanks for those who’ve given advice on stuff, as I’ve used this community for all my intel!",

I've been watching some haircare content lately, I won't mention the names but some of the influencers I follow do all this stuff to grow their hair like rosemary oil on the scalp, using a hair mask and conditioner after, using a scalp massager, using a microfiber towel and so many other tricks, don't get me wrong I've beend doing this stuff on my hair for at least 10 years too, so I'm guilty of that as well but at the same time, I follow a Belarusian girl on Instagram she has the best hair you'll ever see in your entire life, just the color, the length, the texture and she doesn't do all this stuff and I know because I've been following her for years as well, I even found an old video where she was washing her hair and she was washing her length as well, not just her scalp and I was about to scream and she also uses heat but still, her hair is the most gorgeous of them all! Sure she uses hair masks, she uses hair oils with silicone, maybe even a scalp scrub and so on but that just got me thinking...The American influencers promote all these expensive things to take care of your hair, you gotta buy a scalp massager, hair oils, a Dyson, a microfiber towel, expensive bonding treatments, expensive shampoos, do this don't do that, buy this don't buy that and so on meanwhile this girl has way better hair than these people put together and she doesn't use all this junk, sometimes less is more I guess (??)\n\nI think it's time people say this, because these influencers are selling us dreams, there are people wasting money over this stuff out there and it's time people reach this knowledge and that is why I decided to post this thread... I'm not saying people should lose hope, I'm just saying people should always remember that yes, haircare is crucial but these people have great genetics they can count on, they are paid by companies to promote their products but it's not the main reason why they have that hair! Honestly the most important thing you can do is more about cutting bad habits than buying products, sometimes it's more about what you avoid on your hair more than what you use, because hair is susceptible to mechanical damage. I've been taking care of my hair for ten years, my record has been tailbone length (then I made the mistake to go blonde which I don't regret, it was fun but my hair broke at one point then got long again thanks to Olaplex n.3, now I have brown hair and I want to go back to my tailbone length) but even though I've been following the rules for so many years and had successful results, after all the research I did and all the people I've been following on social media, I came to this conclusion: I'm 100% sure hair is all about genetics! \n\nWhat do you think?",

        "body": "There is a difference between hair growth and length retention. Hair growth happens at the scalp most people have fine hair growth and do not need to do anything really to make their hair grow. The way to know if you have a hair growth issue is if you hair is thinning and or if you have balding. That can be genetic but it can also be caused by illness or malnutrition/deficiency so it’s something to look into with a Dr. \n\nLength retention refers to how long the hair is, and this is determined in part by genetics—hair has a terminal length, but it can be heavily influenced by damage and breakage. Most people struggling to grow long hair don’t have an actual hair growth issue but rather have a problem retaining the hair that grows from their scalp. If hair is damaged or broken off from things like chemical bleaching and harsh brushing and combing, the ends of the hair will become weak, split, snap off, and break off. \n\nLots of people are not growing their hair to it’s full length due to bad hair practices that cause damage and breakage. Most people can grow their hair to around waist length and many even longer with proper care. So if your hair is shoulder length and “won’t grow longer” it’s likely because you have damage and breakage on the ends. If you have hair thinning and balding it could be any number of things but generally that’s harder to fix and may require medical intervention. At home remedies like essential oils and ACV rinses are unlikely to do anything to help with actual hair loss. Though some of these practices can be good for hair care. All in all it’s best to use actual products formulated for hair care as these are made specifically to work effectively on hair.",

So say you have trouble growing hair long, the first step is to implement consistently good practices, then you change your diet, start exercising, and settle any health issues. The only thing holding someone back from hair growth should be health issues. Although I do think there's a point of length that not everyone can attain, like say not everyone can grow hair to their knees, but some people can. However, the majority of the population should have the potential to enter the threshold of long hair. Look at your (general you, not you in particular) lifestyle if you think you can't get out of the short range. \n\nThat girl you saw on social media has implemented her practices because she knows without it, she may not have long hair. Some people do have to maximize their potential and she is seeing the fruit of her results through masks, massage, and oils, just like the American influencers, who just promote things at a higher price point.

I have cousins with very long hair and they have had long hair since they were toddlers/5-6 years old. they’ve never had their hair chemically straightened with a relaxer, they don’t use heat a lot, they don’t manipulate their hair a lot, they deep condition everytime they wash, etc. I’m sure they tell their friends they don’t do much to their hair (which is essentially true) but the things I listed that they do contribute to healthy long hair.

Of course genetics plays a role (I always had the potential to grow longer thicker hair I suppose) but so many bad hair practices really did a number on my hair and getting it to where it is now was a matter of learning how to properly take care of it.\n\nI am just learning now for example that I really can’t ever comb my hair even with a wide tooth comb. Detangling brushes work way better for me and I need a ton of conditioner on my hair to detangle (so I usually do so before washing after which I mostly finger detangle). Anyways that works great for me, my hair also likes protein yet I was avoiding using it until recently over fears of “protein overload”. In the last 4-5 months my hair has done wonders I’m actually shocked. It wasn’t horrible or damaged before per se but it had plateaued and wasn’t getting longer for a good year yet in the last few months I have noticed some more length, shine, and smoothness. \n\nSo while genetics do play role that doesn’t mean people can’t grow longer hair or improve the shine, thickness etc… what it does mean is that different hair needs different care practices. Some things about hair are universal (all hair is essentially made of the same stuff) but curl pattern, strand thickness, and damage make a huge difference in how hair should be handled. \n\nMaybe standard hair care practice works for the “Belarusian Girl” but that doesn’t mean it will work for you or others.",

    "body": "Hey lovelies!\n\nHere are somethings I learned while on this journey. I'm hoping it can help someone else out. Please feel free to add/subtract/share your stories with this.\n\nThis post is for people who believe in doctors/medications, not for people who prefer ONLY natural remedies. However, see points 16,17, 30 for natural remedies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Disclaimer: this is just my experience, it might not actually be the be what works for you. I'm using 5% minox foam, one time a day, and this is what I've learned. I will regularly edit this as more things come to mind. Please drop a comment about what you think!:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. There are 4 stages of hair growth. Anagen (growing), Catagen (transition), Telogen (resting), and exogen (shedding) stages. Minoxidil works first by causing the exogen to speed up, and then works backwards to Telogen, and kindly causes those resting hairs to shed as well. This is what happens in the first 'dread shed', which can last anywhere from 2-8 weeks.\n2. At any given time, approx. 10% of hair is in the resting phase. This is what falls out first.\n3. Increasing circulation in your scalp is what keeps your hair in the Anagen phase, but that will also eventually shift into Catogen, and so on.\n4. This dread shed is a good sign that your scalp is reacting well to Minox. Minox is a vasodilator and acts by providing more oxygen to your scalp. This oxygen is what provides the follicles with the proper nutrients to go back to Anagen and Catogen phase.\n5. If you start applying minoxidil to a specific location, you need to continue to apply it there. Stopping while using minoxidil will cause the hair to go back to its deoxygenated strand.\n6. Minox is not going to replace healthy hair from a healthy lifestyle. You need to eat well and get some exercise in, no matter what formulation you use.\n7. Minox works well with other vitamins such as Viviscal, Nutrafol, and other multivitamins.\n8. Rest also plays a crucial role in hair regrowth. Increased cortisol (stress hormone) may cause increased hairloss. Adults should aim for 7-9 hours daily, or however your doctor prescribes.\n9. While other people may have faster results than some when using minox, it should be noted that their hair cycle may be a bit different than yours. Results are usually seen by 6 month mark. Some might not even have dread shed.\n10. If you have dread shed, just note, it will be everywhere. Sweaters, drains, floors, everywhere. It is distressing. Take a deep breath but do not stop using until told by a doctor.\n11. Here are a couple of items that have helped reduce the friction/breakage caused by everyday activities: Boar-bristle brushes, velvet/silk hair scrunchies, silk/satin pillow cases, silk night caps.\n12. Be as gentle as you can possibly be with your hair.\n13. You will/should normally shed anywhere with 50-100 hairs a day. It might look like more if you have thicker or longer hair, and it might look like less if you have thinner and shorter hair.\n14. Hair volume and hair density are not the same thing. Density is the number of strands. Volume is the thickness of each strand. anything 3+ inches thick when wrapped in a ponytail is considered thick hair. 2-3 is medium thick. <1 is thin.\n15. Applying minox at night and using a combination of rosemary oil/peppermint oil the day of the wash (wake up earlier and apply \\~1 hour before shower, if morning shower) will also help with increased circulation.\n16. Rosemary and peppermint oils are natural vasodilators. Sting like hell if you get it in your eye. To use, add a couple of drops to a carrier oil (coconut, jojoba, castor) and apply to affected areas. Caution: these things are pungent.\n17. Taking a warm shower (not washing hair)  half an hour before application helps with pores on the scalp to open up and may increase absorption.\n18. Sweat on hair will reduce minoxidil absorption.\n19. Dermarolling may increase absorption. The thickness of the dermaroller may vary by scalp and by ethnicity. usually 1.5mm is thick enough. Do not use this everyday. Start by parting hair and rolling back and forth in one direction. You should not bleed profusely. Roll over all affected areas. Start with 1x every two weeks, then increase as you see fit. Beware, things maybe marked as 1.5mm needles when they're not. Best to measure if you can. Ones with needles may work better than wheel dermarollers. Sanitize after every use. Replace every few months, as needles might become dull.\n20. To avoid cutting the hair accidentally, may work better if hair is wet. Apply minox after dermarolling, maybe 20-30 minutes, as you feel comfortable.\n21. AGA (androgenic alopecia) and TE (telogen effluvium). AGA can be hormonal, where TE might be caused by stress.\n22. Hairloss caused by TE usually grows back if conditions change.  Stress management is unbelievably important in hair regrowth.\n23. Any sort of anesthesia can cause TE. Yes, even something as small as wisdom tooth removal.\n24. Continued use of minox is the only way to see && keep the results. It is a lifestyle you must commit to, only stopping when doctor says so (pregnancy && breastfeeding).\n25. As of today, Minox is the only FDA approved medication to treat hair loss, even for continued use. Using a stronger dosage of Minox won't necessarily help, past the 5% as the efficacy plateaus at 5%.\n26. There are things called DHT blockers which stop testosterone from being converted into a harmful chemical that causes hair to go into early telogen/exogen phases. These things include saw palmetto and things of the like. However, do not use this supplement until cleared by a doctor as it may cause side affects for child bearing women.\n27. Pura d'or is a brand that makes shampoo specifically with topical biotin and DHT blockers. Ask doc/do research/try if it's best for you.\n28. Do not let minox drip down on your face. it might cause hair growth on your face. unless you want that! more power to you!!! After application, wash hands and face.\n29. Might not be suitable for people with pets. Be sure to talk to a doctor/do your own research before beginning anything.\n30. Garlic, onions, ginger, curry leaves are known natural foods that help with hair loss.\n31. **Shedding is different than hair loss.** Shedding is when you see strands fall on your bed sheets, sink, counters, etc. Loss is when your hair physically miniaturizes (shrinks/breaks in size).\n32. It is impossible to tell to the naked eye what is miniturized and what is new growth, but some say tapered ends of hair strands mean miniturized and hair that sticks up when dry is new growth.However, this is a bit of conjecture as hair that hasn't been cut before might look tapered. Best to have a derm take a look. \n33. if you feel lightheaded when applying minox, it's a sign that you applied too much.\n34. PATCH. TEST. FIRST. TO SEE. IF YOU. HAVE. ANY DAMN. REACTIONS TO THIS! don't just straight up apply. you could be allergic.\n35. Some people may have adverse dermatological (aging faster, wrinkles) or oxotoxic (tinnitus) effects. Stop use if you experience any of these and talk to a doctor, but know that these are rare.\n36. Purchase a scalp scrubber brush, to really clean your scalp if you are going days between washing hair, but using minox.\n37. Always, always ALWAYS, apply to a dry scalp. the foam, at least, takes 3-4 hours to be absorbed.\n38. LIGHTING. IS. EVERYTHING. it may make your hair loss look worse than it actually is.\n39. Please use common sense. If you have hormonal deficiencies or vitamin deficiencies, no matter *what* you use, you might not see results until the underlying problem is addressed. ***One of the most common vitamin deficiencies is Vitamin D. Unbalanced Vitamin D levels can cause hair loss.*** \n40. Don't be afraid to get a second opinion from another dermatologist. Hair loss can also be an endocrine problem (endocrine system regulates hormones), check out an endocrinologist if still concerned. They may assign some bloodwork, maybe regularly. \n41. Protein intake is extremely important for hair regrowth. Your hair is primarily made of protein and sulfate bonds. For the average sedentary woman, you need 46 grams/day. DRI says 0.36 grams of protein per pound, adjust as you see necessary. Be careful, however, too much protein maybe stored as fat. \n\nI am a very impatient person. I blame technology for a part of this. What helped me out is to have a physical daycount of how many days have gone by and how many days more I have left before I hit 3 months. Then i'll do it again for another 3 months. ***These things take time. Let them, and give it an honest effort. Do not stop using it when you see more hair falling out. wish that weak, deoxygenated hair a good riddance. better, thicker strands will replace this one. Just because it has/hasn't worked for someone in the past, doesn't mean it will/won't work for you. Hair is individual, your doctor will know best.***\n\nhere is a silly thing that kept me going. Above my line of vision at my desk, I have a post it note that says the following: \"Take your time, things will get better. Do your best. take a deep breath. It will happen. It will be okay.\" If you made it this far in the post, I am giving you the biggest virtual hug I possibly can. My inbox is ALWAYS open to vents/rants. Sometimes it's easier to vent to a stranger. Don't keep this anxiety bottled up inside, it's not good for anyone.\n\nyou are beautiful. with or without hair, you are beautiful. It sucks what you're going through. Believe me, I know. keep your head up, and do everything you can. you will see a change in due time. Do not compare your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 4. Commit to this. You got this, babe! Celebrate every little victory!\n\nLast of all, do NOT, by any means, let ANYONE belittle you because of something you cannot control. Do NOT be ashamed of this. this is something that affects a lot of women, and we have been stigmatized to not only not discuss this with other women (WTF, right?) but also fall prey to hair care scams across the internet. Do your research, and stay informed. You are doing your absolute best. That is the only thing anyone can ask of you, and more importantly, you can ask of yourself. This takes time. I repeat, this takes time.",

    "body": "Hey guys, as the end of 2023 nears, I thought I'd do a post for those coming to this sub in desperate need of help.\n\nIn this post I’m going to be talking about the science of hair loss and what to do if you are balding and want to stop it.\n\nI’m a medical student and have donated a lot of my personal time to pharmacology, hormones and hair protocols through research and experimentation. There’s a lot going on here on Reddit, and as a beginner it can be very daunting to decide on what to do. Obviously everything should be discussed with your doctor, but below is my best attempt at a guide to explain a little bit about hair loss:\n\n\\-\n\nI first noticed I was balding around 12 months ago, and rather than get caught up in the genetics of hair loss and trying to figure out whether it was Dad, my Mum’s Dad, my Mum’s Dad’s Dad or the goldfish he owned when he was 10, I thought to myself:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I can’t change my **genetics**. Whatever my DNA sequencing (genomic regions) has in store for me in regards to balding, that’s pretty much set. The best I can do is fight as long as I can using the highest quality science, products and methodologies to offset it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that’s what I’ve been doing, with good success, over the past 12 months.\n\nLet’s get into it, and I’m going to do this in order of most important to least (in my opinion).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Getting to the root cause: DHT**\n\nOkay, so if we look at the entire testosterone/HPT axis pathway, cholesterol is converted to testosterone and some people think that’s the end of the line, but it’s actually not; 5-alpha reductase (5A1/2 in the image **below**) is the enzyme responsible for converting Testosterone (T) to its much more potent form DHT (dihydrotestosterone).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5-alpha reductase converts Testosterone to DHT, the hair killer.](https://preview.redd.it/8w41inr0id6c1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c3fa6ef959d1d758c7bd324d0f62191f88d558)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, interestingly, 5-alpha reductase for whatever reason is very high prevalent in skin tissue - including the human scalp. ***And side note***: this is why guys who take testosterone gel or cream often have very high levels of DHT compared to guys who take injections, because the cream is being converted through the skin into DHT at a much higher rate than injectable esters into muscle bellies. But, basically, it is this 5-alpha reductase activity in the scalp that is converting testosterone to DHT, and DHT through a variety of mechanisms leads to follicular miniaturisation (hair thinning, and eventual loss of your hair follicles).\n\nBut **why**? Well, there are hundreds of factors: hormonal (androgen receptor density & sensitivity to said androgens), physical, genetic, environmental. The list goes on.\n\nNote; [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4174066/) goes into a lot more depth for those of you interested.\n\n*But, how do we actually combat balding?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Most men tend to lose their hair in patterns as described by the famous Norwood Scale.](https://preview.redd.it/6m5v2i0fid6c1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=02c45568c3b5427759c449bcd87197502fe2ac8f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Slowing Down Male Pattern Baldness**\n\n**5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride):**\n\nWith how much I’ve spoken about 5-alpha reductase and DHT, it seems logical that stopping this conversion of Testosterone to DHT is the absolute first line of defence against hair loss.\n\nTo really, truly combat hair loss, the first mechanism is as follows: **you absolutely need to reduce your hair follicles’ exposure to DHT.**\n\nAnd how do we do this? Well, finasteride is a drug that acts as a **5-alpha reductase inhibitor**. Sold under the name **Propecia**, the molecule is a strong 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, and has been shown to inhibit around 70% of serum (blood) levels of DHT from peak. The usual starting dose is 1mg daily. Dutasteride (sold under the name **Avodart**) is an even more potent inhibitor (usual starting daily dose is 0.5mg), and can block up to 98% of conversion from T to DHT: it is a much more potent inhibitor of the enzyme that converts T to DHT. Dutasteride would be an option if you wanted a nuclear option to block almost all DHT. In fact, one of my favourite [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15126539/) compared the difference between Finasteride vs. Dutasteride, and as you can see below, the suppression of DHT levels from Dutasteride was significantly more than Finasteride. Not only this, but the half life of Dutasteride is significantly longer than Finasteride (\\~8 hours vs. 5 weeks!), and you can see that in the Dutasteride group after stopping treatment (Follow-up Period), DHT levels remained suppressed for a much longer time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DHT vs. Finasteride - what a study.](https://preview.redd.it/51ro95jxid6c1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1d5c0bb87f58a95ce410a464e59b989bece00fd)\n\nSide effects from 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are rare, although we should speak about them. Online, through various forums, Reddit posts, YouTube videos and TikTok’s time and time again I see posts about nasty Finasteride side effects, post-Finasteride syndrome and how Rob can’t get his Johnson hard anymore because of Finasteride, so his girlfriend left him.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong, side effects have been noted, although current research puts the risk of side effects at around [1-3% of people](https://www.drugwatch.com/propecia/side-effects/), so even though online there is a lot of noise about finasteride and its side effects, I personally don’t think the research supports this scaremongering. There is also going to be a natural selection bias with the stories online, because the guy for whom Finasteride is working well and who is not experiencing any side effects, he isn’t really going to post. Because why would he? He’s doing fine.\n\nHowever, I absolutely sympathise with the people who just cannot tolerate 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Side effects can be very real, and this is why it is vitally important to always consult with a qualified doctor before deciding on any medication: I’m just presenting the science. Everyone reacts slightly differently, and these can be strong medications - so it's important to be well-informed and sensible with whatever path you and your medical practitioner decide to go down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Topical Minoxidil 5% (Rogaine):**\n\nMinoxidil is a compound that has been shown to increase the rate of DNA synthesis in anagen (growth phase) bulbs of hair follicles. Basically minoxidil stimulates hair cells to move from telogen (resting phase) to anagen (growing phase) - so instead of having hair follicles resting, it is telling the body to move them back into a growth phase by shortening the resting phase. The idea here is that you get more ‘regrowth’ of hair follicles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dy63jn3tjd6c1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8670dd032a79aadd7c39bd9df62a0cc89baa2202\n\nMinoxidil stimulates hair cells to shorten the resting (telogen) phase and go back into an anagen (growing phase). Often, progress pictures will show significant new regrowth or ‘baby’ hairs growing with minoxidil treatment.\n\nI apply *Rogaine*, a 5% strength Minoxidil foam twice daily in areas that I feel are receding. The nice thing about the foam is that it isn’t super sticky (unlike some people report with the gel), and it also acts as a nice way to hold my hair throughout the day, like hair product.\n\nAs you can see from the photo below, there is a vast difference between telogen (resting phase) and anagen (growing phase), and the idea is that the more hairs you can keep in anagen, the more healthy your hair will be, by limiting the amount of follicles that inevitably go through an anagen restart and die off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/da6m3qh4kd6c1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=a818ded76fe7f0da40b073a78427c5ebef169bcf\n\nThere is also the option of oral minoxidil, which anecdotally at least seems to be very powerful at regenerating ‘baby’ hairs (or, new regrowth). Again, oral minoxidil can have some pretty significant side effects and drug interactions with blood pressure medications, so speaking through with your doctor is key!\n\n**Ketoconazole Shampoo:**\n\nThis shampoo is primarily an anti-dandruff shampoo, but research has shown it may increase the proportion of hairs in anagen phase (growth phase) - resulting in reduced hair shedding. [This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18498517/) showed that 1% ketoconazole shampoo increased hair diameter over baseline after 6 months of use and reduced shedding. Interestingly, participants’ hair diameter also increased over baseline, showing that it may play a role in creating thicker hair.\n\nNizoral is a common brand here in Australia of 2% strength ketoconazole shampoo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22hcla2ckd6c1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=556a6c320e825bb32c4776c01ec9a9156fcab0b6\n\nWhat is good about ketoconazole, is that it’s also a weak androgen receptor antagonist. What does this mean? It means it competes with DHT and Testosterone for binding to the active binding domain on the human AR (androgen receptor). If a compound can bind to a receptor without influencing its usual effects, it is said to be an **antagonist**. Basically, if ketoconazole can get into an androgen receptor before Testosterone or DHT, it will occupy that site and block T/DHT from binding and starting their usual process of killing off hair follicles (follicular miniaturisation). \n\nGoodbye DHT, nobody wants you here.\n\n**Dermarolling**\n\nDerma-what?\n\nDermarolling is the process of creating micro punctures in the scalp skin to induce a wound healing response, with an array of tiny microneedles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yjwpgfekd6c1.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=39e971f4128c1463f139069e8cb1042ae2a82a8c\n\nIn this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746236/), the dermarolling + minoxidil treated group was statistically superior to the minoxidil only treated group in promoting hair growth in men with balding patterns, for all primary efficacy measures of hair growth. In fact, the microneedling group outperformed even the minoxidil group in terms of how much hair was regrown after 12 weeks:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzoc53hgkd6c1.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0635770d6ffdbf90ead61f6404ed4405b635fd2\n\nThe mechanism seems to be that continued microtrauma to the scalp skin leads to a release of platelet derived growth factors and other growth factors that are sent to the area of scalp, to aid in the skin wound regeneration. The added benefit is that there seems to be some carry over effect to hair growth, as dermarolling seems to activate stem cells or ‘unspecialised’ cells that are yet to be differentiated, and differentiate them into hair follicle cells, meaning more hair growth. Basically, its a wound healing response that brings growth factors to the area of the scalp to increase hair growth.\n\nI have played around with a few different protocols, but I use a 1.5mm roller and roll horizontally, vertically and diagonally for about 30 seconds in areas where my hairline is thinning or receding. I do this every 10 days. You don’t want to press so hard that you draw blood, but it should also hurt slightly. I mean, putting hundreds of tiny spikes into your scalp isn’t really my idea of Sunday night fun. But hey, if it regrows some hair why not?\n\nThere are also derma-stamps and motorised tools, all of which assist with the end goal: creating a wound healing response to bring growth factors to the scalp, and potentially assist the penetration of Minoxidil deeper into the scalp skin tissue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Natural DHT blocking compounds:**\n\nNatural DHT blockers are also options, although obviously the results aren’t going to be nearly as strong as what is mentioned above.\n\nSome people have good results (anecdotally) with rosemary oil applied topically, green tea and saw palmetto are options here. However, the science is very hit and miss, and in any event, I can’t see natural compounds competing against the 'Big 4'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RU58841:**\n\nNow, that’s all good, but what if you need a nuclear chemical. Something that would attack the androgen receptor at a direct level in your scalp? Well, that compound is below. But a quick **warning**: I do not recommend this compound. A lot of people use it, but that doesn’t mean it’s safe. There is no (yes, zero) long-term safety data on the compound below, and whether you choose to take a completely untested chemical is up to you. But I don’t recommend it - have I said that enough?\n\nAlright so, apart from sounding like a bunch of random letters because your cat ran over your keyboard, RU58841 is a strong DHT blocker (it has been shown to inhibit around 70% of DHT binding to the androgen receptor), but not in the way that Finasteride or Dutasteride work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The chemical structure of RU58841.](https://preview.redd.it/stsr6jgmkd6c1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=afe9a816b81618f35f54a5dfeb846ef9385c4f17)\n\nInstead of finasteride and dutasteride which work on inhibiting the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, RU58841 works on the AR itself - occupying the active site, so that when DHT tries to get in and exert its hair destructive effects in the scalp, it can’t, it’s literally ***blocked*** from accessing the active site of the androgen receptor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RU58841 operates like an androgen receptor antagonist \\(3rd receptor, on the right\\). It binds to the receptor and stops testosterone and DHT from binding, meaning that DHT cannot then exert its hair miniaturisation effects.](https://preview.redd.it/nw42b51xkd6c1.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=36e4592b66d0108e9a24189d3b8e76f6aa407a02)\n\nAnd in [this study](https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-e5b77395-5e0e-3da3-bef2-0eadea69c845), RU58841 was found to inhibit 70% of DHT binding. Combining something like finasteride or dutasteride which attacks 5-alpha reductase converting T to DHT with RU58841 which stops \\~70% of DHT binding to the androgen receptor, and you’d now be attacking hair loss from 2 *vectors*: **T to DHT conversion, as well as at a receptor level**. Now you can start to understand why this is a nuclear option for hair loss, and incredibly powerful.\n\nHowever, despite how good all of that sounds in practice, just remember, RU58841 is completely untested in regards to side effects. There is no long-term safety data on how it may or can impact human health, so what I’m saying (for legal reasons) is don’t use it. Get what I’m saying?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAnd, there it is guys. Now, just a quick note, this isn’t a super comprehensive list of all supplements for a hair regrowth/hair protection protocol, but is a solid start.\n\nThere are certainly more ‘niche’ options, or compounds in development now that may be promising (or not, looking at you Phase 3 of Pyrilutamide trials), but this guide was just the bare basics for a beginner to wrap his head around (no pun intended) the science and how to start combatting AGA.\n\nIn particular, if you want to save your hair, it’s going to be the ‘**big 4**’: finasteride (or Dutasteride), Minoxidil, Ketoconazole shampoo and derma-rolling roughly once a week to every 2 weeks.\n\nThis would follow the best possible science that we have at the moment, in terms of targeting as many vectors as possible:\n\n1. T to DHT blockade (5-alpha reductase inhibitors, Fin/Dut)\n2. Anagen/telogen manipulation (Minoxidil)\n3. Localised scalp tissue androgen receptor antagonism (Keto, RU58841)\n4. Wound healing response cascade (physical microneedling/trauma)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you enjoyed and got something out of this guide! My social links are on my profile if interested in more.",

It's what I've been looking for, and you did an excellent job making things easier to understand for beginners like me.\n\nI have a question, I've dealt with thinning hair and receeding hairline since I was 17, I'm 23 now, and from what I've identified -- with the help of my bald brother -- I now have a Norwood 1 - 1.5, not too much ig? I also don't know if the progress of my MPB is fast or slow, I don't have anything to compare to.\n\nAnyway, enough rambling, what I want to ask is, is Minoxidil plus derma rolling enough for me to further slow the baldness? Or even enough to almost completely stop it? I'm planning to start to combat my mpb, and I don't know if it's okay for me to just do Minox only even for the first few years.\n\nI'm also considering using fin, but I'm scared of the side effects because I've already experienced sexual problems due to SSRIs, I've stopped using them for this reason so I'm scared if it's going to happen again.\n\nAdditionally, I'm a combat sports athlete who takes his strength training seriously. Does finasteride directly affect my testosterone levels? My muscle growth? My athleticism? Will it result on me being feminized? \n\nThank you for your time reading this.",

    "body": "A New CO₂-Based Spread Could Let Us Create a Future Without Farming\n\nA California startup called Savor has created a groundbreaking butter alternative — and it’s made not from cows or crops, but from carbon dioxide. \n\nUsing a thermochemical process, the company captures CO₂ from the air and combines it with hydrogen and oxygen to create synthetic fat. \n\nThis fat is then blended with water, beta-carotene, rosemary oil, and an emulsifier to create a spread that reportedly tastes just like real butter. Informal taste panels — and even Bill Gates — have praised the product, which could soon receive regulatory approval in the U.S.\n\nWhat makes Savor’s creation so exciting isn’t just its taste — it’s the potential environmental impact. Traditional butter has a carbon footprint of 2.4 grams of CO₂ per calorie, while Savor’s synthetic version clocks in at less than 0.8 grams. \n\nThis innovation could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and eliminate the need for deforestation-prone crops like palm oil. Plus, without the need for farmland or livestock, it could free up land for conservation and use less than one-thousandth of the water required by conventional agriculture. While pricing and public perception remain challenges, Savor’s “carbon butter” may point toward a new era of food made sustainably — and scientifically — from thin air.",

Decided to keep it for god knows what, excellent baseline on my progress few months of growing, no trimming, generally bad hair care. \n\n2. Came on tressless and got the nizoral shampoo and condition as recommended, 6 month supply of liquid minox, rosemary oil, biotin oil, and derma roller( .05)\n\n3 and 4. Just pictures of the temple to see if the hair follicles are gone. \n\n5. Believe that was taken in march. Dropped the roller for the stamp. \n\n6. I started to get a terrible side affect of the minox. Symptoms included, itchiness in the scalp and face, breaking out in the face, saggy skin, swelling on the bags, and bumpy like texture in the lips. Took maybe a week or a few days to clear. I’ve tried several times over (even yesterday) and the symptoms pop up again (not as bad)\n\n7 and 8. Months march and April\n\n9 and 10. Took Yesterday. Today I dropped both shampoos and condition for more ethnic stuff. \n\nI do not take vitamins I do not work out I stamp once a week every Sunday until I feel like stopping with the 1.5.",

In the future, where you might need a hair transplant, the frequent and deeper derma needles could create a problem with the skin hardness and make it difficult.  So, do look into that on hair transplant doctors' youtube channels.  Also, you don't need to stamp vigorously.  Just take it easy with it, so in the future it won't give you any trouble. \n\n Alspo, make sure you oil your scalp with coconut oil 2-3 times a week, and that is when you should shampoo as well.  You need to wash your scalp every day to get rid of the mino and use Soap Nuts (reetha) powder to wash your hair daily to get rid of mino.  All you need is mix a tbsp with 1-2 tbsp water and wash your head with it.  Btw, soap nuts are used in shampoos.  It's the main ingredient.  It won't foam, but it will wash your hair.  You can also add a once a week Apple Cider Vinegar regiment to clean your scalp.  1 tbsp ACV+1tbsp water, and soak it with a cotton ball or whichever way you want.  Leave for 15 minutes and then rinse it.  Always gently massage the coconut oil whenever you use them.\n\nBtw, I'm very happy about your progress.  I think I'm going to take my regiment seriously so I can get back my widow's peak and temples or save whatever is left of it.",

I mostly used Dove and then switched to Clinic plus. Nothing worked. Even though I take a head bath 3 times a week, seeing the hair in the bathroom almost made me cry :/\n\nSo I looked for Ayurvedic shampoo and thought of trying this \"Mukti Gold\"(Available in Amazon) after seeing some YouTube video. Guys, it's definitely a life changer. The hair I used to lose for a week is same as the hair I now lose for a month.\n\nI also started applying hair oil the day before the headbath and that oil is mixed with rosemary oil. I don't know if applying the oil or adding rosemary to it or changing the shampoo helped, it did. I don't know if it'll work for others but it should since it's completely natural.\n\nI suggested to my colleagues and my family as well. \n\nNote: It doesn't give you a lot of foam like other shampoos, definitely not a good smell while applying but it doesn't smell at all after the hair is dried. \n\nPS: Nobody is paying me to promote this, just a suggestion to fellow hair losers😂.\n\nEdit: For those who are saying it's the water, for me it's not. I've been using the same water before and after the change and there's no change in the water, (atleast from my side, not sure if there's a change in the supply), yet I saw positive results and yes, I too see my shower with white substance.",

It's done wonders for a lot of people, including me. Imagine if the water can leave so much deposit on a bucket, how acidic it'd make your scalp?\n\nThird, stress is known to play a big role in increasing hairfall, aging etc. Try meditation or some activity that reduces stress.

That would be like a weeks worth for me.\n\nI have really thick hair, so people ask me about it... to be honest, I think 85 percent of it is genetics for me. So the thing to notice is when there is a big change for your own body. \n\nA simple thing to do, is make sure you are getting enough vitamins, your hair growth starts on the inside... your hair is seen as optional by the body, so it's the first place that gets dinged by poor nutrition.\n\nYou might want to get a checkup to see if your blood work shows anemia, or other shortages. \n\nI personally had to find an separate iron chew, or I just wont take the vitamin. Iron in pills just hurts my stomach too much.\n\nThe other thing that made a difference in my hair? Weirdly, was my marriage. My ex was abusive, and the stress of that was so intense it made my hair thin over the years compared to my genetic ability to grow thick lush hair. I didn't even realize stuff he was doing counted as abuse until I left him... \n\nThen with no special effort, over the years, my braid/pony tail is literally 3-4x thicker now, even though I'm in my 40's",

I use a heat protectant as often as possible though\n\n- I wear it in a plait 80% of the time, this has really helped with breakage and is perfect to lock in moisture after i’ve oiled the middle and ends, usually i use a bit of hair oil (a nice quality argan oil one is good) or the r&b hair moisturiser by Lush. \n\n- I use rosemary oil mixed with castor oil on my roots about once a fortnight, i massage it in with my head upside down, leave it for about 2 hours then wash it out during my usual hair wash. I have found my hair does look better and grows slightly quicker when I keep this up regularly\n\nAND! last bit of advice needed - I have realised my hair is not very absorbent for some reason, for example it takes a long time for it to actually start getting wet when i get into the shower..it doesn’t really take much moisture and conditioners do nothing for me, only certain oils absorb well and even then sometimes it just feels like sits on top rather than actually absorbing into the hair shaft… any ideas?",

The OP is referencing a really BS study that proves nothing (check good breakdowns in the comments) and the post surprisingly has got so many upvotes ☹\n\nIt's time to say out loud that if a paper is published as a study it is not an evidence automatically. I have found an informative video from Lab Muffin Beauty called [Rosemary oil for hair growth? How to spot bad science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q). She explained really well how the research is done, how studies are published and reviewed and why not every study is an actual science (+how to spot methodology errors).\n\nI also constantly see comments where people reference some studies they didn't actually read (the paper itself with methodology, not just the abstract) thinking if a study is published then it's a proof. Well, it is not.\n\nMy own minimum criteria for a study to consider it worth referencing:\n\n1. The study is peer reviewed in a journal with good reputation and high citation rating;\n2. The study is done in-vivo on actual volunteers with actual topical product;\n3. It is placebo controlled, meaning the product is compared to no treatment at all (and both formulas are disclosed);\n4. It is double/triple blinded;\n5. Number and distribution of volunteers is statistically significant (hello claims \"9 of 10 women\" from Garnier);\n6. The result is measured with objective methods, better instrumentally, not just a questionnaire;\n7. The result is not only statistically significant, but also significant for the consumer.",

I decided to start oiling as a way to get a healthier scalp and more hair growth. I felt that I followed steps as detailed as described and began the hair shedding stages which were always claimed to be expected. Well, the hair shedding never stopped. I started to notice EXTREME hair fallout after washing my hair and continued hair fall throughout the day. I eventually took a photo of the back of my scalp and noticed how much hair fallout had actually occurred now that I could directly see my scalp. I immediately stopped the oiling and have seen a huge reduction in hair fallout, like it’s shocking. I know there are other horror stories with similar experiences so I’m just posting this as a warning to others, do not follow these oiling trends, it’s not a solution for everyone and those with more sensitive scalps should stay away from it completely. Signed, a girl who is now on Nutrafol and Vegamour scalp serum in hopes of getting my hair back to where it was 3 months ago 😭\n\nEdit: I listed this in my original post but since I’m getting some comments on the matter, this is a personal experience and I’ve posted to warn others who may also be going through a similar situation. As I’ve noted, oiling is not for everyone, it does, however, work for some. The trend confuses people to think that it works for everyone without the proper warnings.\n\nAs for what oil I used - 100% pure rosemary oil diluted with Argan oil ",

Aside from providing additional hydration and calming to my skin, they also help me unwind from a long day at work. I usually use a sheet mask or toner mask nearly everyday so over the years I’ve tried out quite a few! I add to this list every so often over the years and now it’s grown to the size that I should post so I can start on a nice new page. For most of the masks below I’ve used at least a box of…for some I’ve used many boxes. If you have any sheet mask recommendations, I would love to hear them! :) If you want a quick summary, scroll to the bottom :)\n\n**Skin Type:** Normal forehead and dry to very dry cheeks depending on the season. Using tretinoin so skin is occasionally irritated and sensitive.\n\n**Climate**: Cool and humid, mild temperatures, lots of rain.\n\n**Abbreviations:**\n\n* **MRP** = Maybe Repurchase\n* **WNRP** = Would Not Repurchase\n* **WRP** = Would Repurchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Abib**\n\n* **\\[Gummy Sheet Mask - Heartleaf Sticker\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/abib-gummy-sheet-mask-heartleaf-sticker**](https://incidecoder.com/products/abib-gummy-sheet-mask-heartleaf-sticker)**)** **-** Mask is comfortable, super soft microfiber material and adheres to my face really well; mask feels like your second skin. I consistently used the mask everyday for 2 weeks and saw a slight reduction in redness at the end. Hydration was decent but there are other sheet masks that left my skin feeling more plump (e.g. Rovection Lotus Calming Mask) and calm (e.g. BOJ Centella Calming Mask). The mask is pricey but for every 2 sheet masks you use, there is enough serum for you to do 1 toner mask. ***Alcohol free. 4/5. WRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beauty of Joseon**\n\n* **\\[Centella Asiatica Calming Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/beauty-of-joseon-centella-asiatica-calming-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/beauty-of-joseon-centella-asiatica-calming-mask)**)** \\- So soothing and gentle! Centella Asiatica Extract is the #2 ingredients and makes up 15% of the serum. The mask also contains 3 different types of hyaluronic acid. Minimal to no fragrance, very soft sheet material (tencel/cellulose) that adheres to face well. No sticky finish. I prefer this one over the Abib one for calming and soothing. ***Alcohol free. 5/5. WRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dr. Jart+**\n\n* **\\[Ceramidin Facial Barrier Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-ceramidin-facial-barrier-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-ceramidin-facial-barrier-mask)**) -** Nourishing, Strengthening, Repairing. I absolutely LOVE this one and always try to have some on hand. When I started tretinoin I had dry, flaky and sensitive skin. My skin was so irritated and flaky at times I couldn't apply sunscreen and could barely apply moisturizer; I looked like a snake shedding their skin. Everytime I used one of these masks the flakiness would all be gone the next day. The cellulose sheet is very soft (feels kind of like microfiber) and the liquid is cream-like, like mixing the ceramidin liquid and moisturizer together. \\*How does toner masking with the Ceramidin Liquid compare?\\* The liquid contains denatured alcohol as the 3rd ingredient and is not as thick/creamy as the sheet mask liquid. Still good and more cost effective but for really bad skin days, I would recommend going for the sheet mask. ***Alcohol free. 5/5. WRP***\n* **\\[Cicapair Calming Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-cicapair-calming-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-cicapair-calming-mask)**)** \\- Mask was okay. The cellulose sheet was thin and each mask was loaded with essence so you could soak some pads and do a toner mask. It helped with redness but I think there are better sheets masks for calming, soothing and hydration. I also didn't enjoy the smell, it smells like kitchen cleaner or herbal windex to me. ***Alcohol free. 0/5. WNRP***\n* **\\[Porecting Solution Bubbling Charcoal Sheet Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-porecting-solution-bubbling-charcoal-sheet-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-porecting-solution-bubbling-charcoal-sheet-mask)**)** \\- This sheet mask is well loved by many but for me, it was one of 2 things ever that I've had to take off after a few mins and rewash my face. To use, you rub the mask and bubbles will form to clear your pores. A tingling sensation started so I stopped rubbing early on. I was hoping the tingling would stop as a result but nope, it grew more intense so ended up taking the mask off and rewashing my face. I was too scared to try again so I ended up giving the rest of the box away. Just a note that you have to separate the mask from the dressing it's included with. Unfortunately it's black as well but the material is thinner than the mask (cellulose material). I've seen review comments where people say there are no bubbles and it turns out they're using the serum soaked dressing instead of the actual mask. ***0/5. WNRP***\n* **\\[Soothing Hydra Solution Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-dermask-soothing-hydra-solution-deep-hydration-sheet-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-dermask-soothing-hydra-solution-deep-hydration-sheet-mask)**) -** Thicker serum consistency similar to the Vital Hydra Solution Mask, sheet is cellulose and thin. Aloe and phytonicdes are the active soothing ingredients.  Sheet mask is well saturated but overall, it was just an alright mask. Nothing mind blowing. For those with sensitive skin, this mask contains alcohol as the 4th ingredient as well as essential oils. ***2.5/5. WNRP***\n* **\\[Vital Hydra Solution Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-dermask-water-jet-vital-hydra-solution**](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-jart-dermask-water-jet-vital-hydra-solution)**)** \\- The cellulose sheet is thin and soaked in a thick serum with a light scent. This was a deeply hydrating mask that made my skin feel plump. It dried down nicely (no sticky or tacky feeling) and because the serum is thicker, I didnt have to worry about serum dripping as I lied down. Does not have as  much extra serum as some of the other Dr. Jart+ masks but still worth it. For those with sensitive skin, this mask contains alcohol as the 4th ingredient as well as essential oils. ***3.5/5. MRP.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dr. Morita**\n\n* **\\[Hyaluronic Acid Essence Mask / Moisturizing Renewal Mask / Intensive Hydrating Mask / Rich Source of Youthful Renewal Mask / Revitalizing Essence Facial Mask / Intensive Whitening Essence Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/brands/dr-morita**](https://incidecoder.com/brands/dr-morita)**)** \\- Despite the different types, I found all the masks were interchangeable as each had the same formulation, feel and effect: watery essence that was hydrating and had a very light floral scent. In fact, most of their masks (all in the list above except the Intensive Whitening Mask) have the same first 5 ingredients: Water; Dipropylene Glycol; Sodium PCA; PPG-28-Buteth-35; and Niacinamide; so no wonder they all feel the same. Most of the masks contained different types of hyaluronic acids, some contained multiple types of ceramides and plant extracts, and a few contained collagen, sake and/or caviar too. No drying alcohols and overall I think the masks are great for all skin types. The sheet material feels a bit thicker than most and contains slits so you can fit the mask better on your face. I thought the essence was too runny for my preference and found myself wiping away lots of dipping essence while lying down. The sheet did not adhere well to the face so walking around while sheet masking was not an option. It would be better if the essence was a serum consistency instead. I feel like they're your basic sheet mask that provides the much needed bit of extra hydration mask but doesn't provide anything else. I enjoyed using the masks but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase them; however if you're looking for a basic no frills hydrating mask without heavy fragrance, these are great and very inexpensive, especially in Taiwan where 4 - 5 boxes is just $20 CAD (each box has 8-10 masks). Each mask is also loaded with so much essence you can get a few toner masks out of each one. ***Alcohol-free. 2/5. WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Face Shop / Nature Republic**\n\n* **\\[The Solution and Real Nature Mask Lines (various)\\](\\*\\*\\*\\***[**https://incidecoder.com/brands/the-face-shop**](https://incidecoder.com/brands/the-face-shop)**)**\\]) **-** These are the sheet masks I started with when I got more into skincare. These are super affordable, very accessible and during my student days, these were the masks I gravitated to. I felt the essence/serum consistency in each mask was similar but each mask was distinguishable based on all the different scents (my fave was the green tea one). I used all mainly for hydration and to be refreshed so I cant speak to the claimed benefits but from the ingredients list most beneficial ingredients were lower down. The masks were comfortable but didn’t fit my face properly. Denatured alcohol in their top 5 ingredients list and they are scented so I would avoid these if you’re sensitive to alcohol or fragrance. ***2/5. WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I'm From**\n\n* **\\[Mugwort Sheet Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-sheet-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-sheet-mask)**)** \\- I love the mugwort scent. This mask contains 91.45% mugwort and  is soothing, hydrating and calming. Redness is reduced relatively fast - not as fast as the I'm From mugwort wash off mask but this is more hydrating than the wash off mask if you’re looking for something that offers both hydration and calming. The sheet mask material is 100% plant based and known as “I-cell” but it’s so-so in quality: not super soft, a bit rough and I felt the material detracted from the experience. These masks are on the pricier side and not as accessible so I probably won’t repurchase - I would rather purchase the essence and wash-off mask, and do a toner mask with the essence. ***Alcohol, fragrance and EO free. 3/5. WNRP.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Isntree**\n\n* **\\[Isntree Spot Saver Mugwort Gauze\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/isntree-spot-saver-mugwort-gauze-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/isntree-spot-saver-mugwort-gauze-mask)**) -** I was concerned the gauze material would be similar in texture to the I’m From sheet mask and be  uncomfortable but the material is quite soft. Contains 45% Mugwort extract but mugwort scent is very faint. I increased my tretinoin strength when I was testing out this sheet mask and definitely felt this mask played a part in keeping my skin calm and moisturized. ***Alcohol, fragrance and EO free. 4/5. WRP.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Leaders**\n\n* **\\[Mediu Amino Moisture Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/leaders-mediu-amino-mousture-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/leaders-mediu-amino-mousture-mask)**)** \\- Contains 17 different amino acids to help strengthen the skin barrier. Sheet mask material is soft cotton but its slightly heavier and thicker than cellulose/water gel types. Every time I use this mask I never feel like the serum penetrated my skin to deeply nourish or hydrate. Leaves a sticky finish. Nothing special. For every 2 masks you’ll have enough serum to do a toner mask. ***Alcohol free.*** ***2.5/5. WNRP.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lululun**\n\n* **\\[Moisture Balance Facial Sheet Mask (Pink)\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/lululun-balance-moisture-face-mask-pink**](https://incidecoder.com/products/lululun-balance-moisture-face-mask-pink)**) -** The resealable bag comes with 7 masks (they also have 32 packs) and are intended for everyday maskers to use for 5-10 mins each day instead of the usual \\~20 mins. Fragrance free with environmentally friendly packaging. Each mask is lightly soaked and offers light hydration but for me, it wasn’t enough so I wouldn’t say these are worth it in my case but I can see others enjoying this - especially if you’re the type to use a face mask in the morning before makeup application. ***Alcohol, fragrance and EO free. 1/5. WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mediheal**\n\n* **\\[Double Calming Water Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/mediheal-double-calming-water-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/mediheal-double-calming-water-mask)**)** \\- Great quality and affordable. While most soothing masks focus on cica, mugwort and/or madecassoside, this mask’s main star is allantoin but there are minor amounts of cica and madecassoside as well. Comfortable and thin tencel/cellulose sheet that adheres well. Noticeable redness reduction. ***Alcohol free. 4/5. WRP***\n* **\\[Hyalu Moist Essence Mask\\]**([https://incidecoder.com/products/mediheal-hyalu-moist-essence-mask](https://incidecoder.com/products/mediheal-hyalu-moist-essence-mask)) - Comfortable tencel sheet material that adheres well. Minimal scent. Skin definitely feels hydrated afterwards but I felt the Rovection Lotus Calming and JM Solution Bird’s Nest ones were more hydrating. Would still recommend this one. ***Alcohol free. 3.5/5. WRP***\n* **\\[Pepta Lifting Ampoule Mask\\]**([https://incidecoder.com/products/mediheal-pepta-lifting-ampoule-mask](https://incidecoder.com/products/mediheal-pepta-lifting-ampoule-mask)) - Similar to above, same comfortable tencel sheet material that adheres well. Contains 6 different peptides to help with skin firming but unfortunately I can’t confirm appreciable difference to skin firmness; however, I did feel my skin was moisturized. There is a slight sticky finish with this one but not sticky on the level of honey propolis masks. ***Alcohol free. 3.5/5. WRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Beauty Diary**\n\n* **\\[Black Pearl Brightening Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/black-pearl-bightening-mask-my-beauty-diary**](https://incidecoder.com/products/black-pearl-bightening-mask-my-beauty-diary)**) -** My favorite out of the three MBD masks I’ve tried but in comparison to all the other masks, this one was okay. Licorice root extract and arbutin are the active brightening ingredients in this mask and I would say I did notice some brightening in my complexion. Mask is made of tencel and also contains aloe for soothing. ***Alcohol free.*** ***2.5/5. WNRP.***\n* **\\[Damask Rose Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/my-beauty-diary-damask-rose-facial-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/my-beauty-diary-damask-rose-facial-mask)**)** \\- Thin tencel sheet mask with lots of serum so you end up with a thoroughly soaked sheet mask that offers lots of hydration. Decent and not as heavily scented as the red wine mask but not memorable. ***Alcohol free. 2/5. WNRP.***\n* **\\[Red Wine Revitalizing Mask(\\*\\*\\*\\***[**https://www.skincarisma.org/products/my-beauty-diary/red-vine-revitalizing-mask)\\]**](https://www.skincarisma.org/products/my-beauty-diary/red-vine-revitalizing-mask)\\])\\]) - Hydrating like the damask rose mask but the scent of the red wine mask was a bit too strong for me so I never gravitated towards it...I ended up not using the entire box of 8 before expiry so I used a couple for my body before throwing the rest out. ***Alcohol free. 0/5. WNRP.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Jayjun**\n\n* **\\[Essential Brightening Mask (Rosemary)\\](**[**https://jayjun-usa.com/products/essential-brightening-mask**](https://jayjun-usa.com/products/essential-brightening-mask)**) -** Strong rosemary scent - feels like you’re doing aromatherapy while sheet masking and I didn’t mind it; however, I can see that some people will. Rosemary oil and niacinamide are the main brightening ingredients and I did notice a more even complexion the next day. Rosemary oil is supposed to be anti-inflammatory so that also helps. I tried this mask prior to using tretinoin so I will likely not repurchase now because of the possible skin irritating ingredients. Sheet is made of tencel and soft. ***3/5. WNRP.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**JM Solution**\n\n* \\[**Active Pink Snail Brightening Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/jm-solution-active-pink-snail-brightening-mask-prime**](https://incidecoder.com/products/jm-solution-active-pink-snail-brightening-mask-prime)**)** \\- Serum is pink and gloopy, and very hydrating. Sheet material is cellulose.I didn’t notice any brightening effects but with the gloopy hydration, I felt it helped maintain my skin barrier. Loaded with serum - I poured all the serum into a container and was able to use it generously for a few days. ***Alcohol free. 3.5/5. MRP.***\n* **\\[Active Bird Nest Moisture Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/jm-solution-active-birds-nest-moisture-mask-prime**](https://incidecoder.com/products/jm-solution-active-birds-nest-moisture-mask-prime)**)** **-** This mask is a hydration bomb! They’re great for the winter. Super hydrating and very gentle, soft cellulose sheet material. Adheres decently well but not like the Abib gummy or Rovectin lotus masks. In addition to bird’s nest, the mask contains artemisia and calendula extract, collagen (humectant) and multiple types of hyaluronic acid.. Like all JM Solution masks, it’s drenched in serum and feels more luxurious than the price point. This one is my favorite out of all the JM Solution ones I’ve tried. ***Alcohol free. 4.5/5. WRP***\n* **\\[Glow Luminous Rose Firming Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/jm-solution-glow-luminous-flower-firming-sheet-mask-rose**](https://incidecoder.com/products/jm-solution-glow-luminous-flower-firming-sheet-mask-rose)**) -** Rose scent is nice and not overpowering. Similar to previous notes, mask material is soft cellulose and sheet is thoroughly soaked in serum. Contains peptides to help with skin firming. I’m relatively young still so no appreciable difference in skin firmness or elasticity can be confirmed. No difference in luminosity was noticed either but the mask is hydrating. Compared to the other JM Solution ones, this one does contain alcohol. ***3/5. WNRP.***\n* \\[**Honey Luminous Royal Propolis Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/jm-solution-honey-luminous-royal-propolis-mask**](https://incidecoder.com/products/jm-solution-honey-luminous-royal-propolis-mask)**) -** Moisturizing, nourishing and hydrating. Soaked in serum made up of propolis, royal jelly, honey, five different peptides and hyaluronic acid. Like most honey/propolis serums/masks, the serum does leave a slight sticky feeling so although you have lots of extra serum leftover to rub all over your body, I usually refrain and will pour the serum in a container to just use on my face. Will likely not repurchase because of the sticky finish. Material is also cellulose. ***Alcohol free. 3.5/5. WNRP***\n* **\\[Marine Luminous Pearl Deep Moisture Mask\\](**[**https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA210001523&lang=en&gclid=CjwKCAjwrZOXBhACEiwA0EoRD0d083J7\\_q1u49s6DH2IfTBMWZUsUMaZn4oWLVaZbNwEJ09Hvq6vmxoCeFgQAvD\\_BwE#prd-detail-page**](https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA210001523&lang=en&gclid=CjwKCAjwrZOXBhACEiwA0EoRD0d083J7_q1u49s6DH2IfTBMWZUsUMaZn4oWLVaZbNwEJ09Hvq6vmxoCeFgQAvD_BwE#prd-detail-page)**) -** A 3-step mask pack that comes with a serum, sheet mask and eye cream. Used to be my favorite at one time. Mask pack does a very sufficient job at deeply hydrating the skin; all products contain multiple types of hyaluronic acid and marine collagen. Sheet material is thin and made of cellulose, adheres well and is almost transparent after application. Baby powder scent. Slight tacky finish. ***Alcohol free. 3.5/5. MRP.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ROVECTIN**\n\n* **\\[Lotus Water Calming Mask\\](**[**https://rovectin.com/products/lotus-water-calming-sheet-mask-1-pack**](https://rovectin.com/products/lotus-water-calming-sheet-mask-1-pack)**)** \\- It's amazing and my favorite! The mask fits and adheres very well to the face - I honestly feel you could dance with this on and it wont budge. It's a watergel/hydrogel type of sheet so it's very soft, comfy and incredibly thin - it feels like your second skin. The sheet absorbs the serum very well, which is thick, soothing and deeply hydrating. When I first tried this mask I was so surprised at how plump my skin was afterwards! The mask contains lotus flower extract, houttuynia cordata extract and aquaxl (patented formula that Rovectin uses in their popular toner) to achieve its goal of calming irritated skin which I think it does a good job of. If you like toner masking, for every 2 masks there's enough serum for 1 toner mask. Not super generous with the serum but it's okay, I would still repurchase. ***Alcohol, fragrance and EO free. 5/5. WRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Secret Key**\n\n* **\\[Secret Key Starting Treatment Essential Mask Sheet\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/secret-key-starting-treatment-essential-mask-sheet**](https://incidecoder.com/products/secret-key-starting-treatment-essential-mask-sheet)**)** \\- I receive 1 mask as a sample so I can’t speak to efficiency but it was pleasant and more worth it than the SK-II mask. Strong ferment scent which is a good sign that it’s filled with lots of galactomyces to help brighten complexion. A hydrating mask. Mask was soaked but there wasn’t a lot of extra essence for a toner mask. ***Alcohol, fragrance and EO free. 3.5/5. MRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SK-II**\n\n* **\\[Facial Treatment Mask\\](**[**https://incidecoder.com/products/sk-ii-facial-treatment-mask-2**](https://incidecoder.com/products/sk-ii-facial-treatment-mask-2)**)** \\- After all the hype about how life changing and splurge-worthy these masks are, and how brides have this in their skincare arsenal before their wedding day, I was really excited to try these masks out. Similar to the essence, the mask has a heavy fermentation scent but I don’t mind it. While unfolding, I was surprised at how thick, bulky and stiff the cotton sheet mask material was - honestly I think this is the thickest sheet mask I’ve ever used. I think there are other material types that would have been better in absorbing the serum and without the provided side slits, it would have been difficult to find the perfect fit/smooth out because the material is just so stiff. After usage I patted the remaining serum in but when I continued the remainder of my skincare routine, the serum residue started to pill on me. So the mask is expensive, stiff and pills? Not sure why there’s so much hype. It’s not particularly hydrating either. I’ve noticed a ‘glow from within’ from using the essence but I don’t think the mask provided above average glow in comparison. I would rather spend the money on the essence and layer it. ***Alcohol, fragrance and EO free. 1/5. WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SNP**\n\n* **\\[Black Pearl Renew Black Ampoule Mask\\](**[**https://snpcos.us/products/black-pearl-renew-black-ampoule-mask-sheet**](https://snpcos.us/products/black-pearl-renew-black-ampoule-mask-sheet)**)** \\- This mask is really trying to do it all - brighten, hydrate, soothe, strengthen and protect. Contains black pearl, niacinamide, rice extract, centella asiatica, soybean extract, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. Sheet thickness is medium, material is soft (cellulose) and scent is light. I think because this mask is trying to do a bit of everything, there are better masks for each specific target (e.g. get the BOJ one for soothing) but overall I enjoyed this mask and would like to try more from the brand. ***3.5/5. MRP.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thank You Farmer**\n\n* **\\[Miracle Age Repair Cotton Mask\\](**[**https://www.skincarisma.com/products/thank-you-farmer/miracle-age-repair-cotton-mask/ingredient\\_list**](https://www.skincarisma.com/products/thank-you-farmer/miracle-age-repair-cotton-mask/ingredient_list)**)** \\- Strong but pleasant citrus scent. I didn't read the ingredients before purchasing but the 2nd half of the list is all essential oils (18 total) so sensitive skin folks beware. The mask is similar in feel and consistency to the Dr. Jart Ceramidin mask - cream serum texture, thicker soft cotton material. The mask claims to help brighten, nourish and provide anti wrinkle care. I didn't notice any brightening effects and can't speak to the anti wrinkle effects but it does help nourish skin. I noticed my redness remained after using the mask so I am a bit concerned the EOs will eventually cause me to break out. I will likely not repurchase as I prefer the Dr. Jart ceramidin mask instead. ***Alcohol free. 2/5 WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Favorites**\n\n* **Calming:** Beauty of Joseon - Centella Asiatica Calming Mask\n* **Hydration:** ROVECTIN - Lotus Water Calming Mask\n* **Nourishment:** Dr. Jart- Ceramidin Facial Barrier Mask",

I bought so many of them since they had so many sales, but since Ive branched out more I can tell how not great they were.... The essences were probably fine, but the mask itself was not. Now that its more popular to use other materials, the cotton  masks that would dry your skin out way too early just seem so old school.  Im surprised about your experience with the MBD ones though! I generally enjoyed those, as well as the JM solutions ones...  I dont use sheet masks much anymore and have such a stash left to get through....\n\nIF anyone wants to know , I find the best sheet masks Ive ever used were the Papa Recipe ones, followed by Naruko ones, but  I havent tried the rovectin ones",

I also burned my neck with boiling water in my 20s and the skin is sagging a little from where the burn was.

I just wasnt sure what was happening and I was afraid of it happening to other people. \n\nI am scared to post this because my last post got a lot of attention and I dont want to be attacked for scaring people, but I feel like its the right thing to do. I dont want to bash a company and say one of their products burned off my hair because of the formula when thats not the true reason my hair burnt off.\n\nIf anyone is wondering my curl pattern is fine. My scalp is a little sensitive because I had to scrub the hell out of my scalp to get the rosemary oil off. I now know why my hair isnt growing and I cut off my split ends/dead hair, which wasnt a lot, maybe a half an inch. My hair is in mini twists and it actually coils at the end. My hair has never done that, so Im happy.\n\nAgain Im very very sorry if I scared you.",

    "body": "Have been dealing with hair thinning for the better part of the decade now. I’ve spent the vast majority of it trying remedies and plant-based solutions. Everything from hearsay to ancient wisdom. Over time, at least from my own personal experience, I have isolated what truly works and what doesn’t. My take of the best and worst remedies I’ve tried over a 3-year horizon (bear with the long post, have tried to make it as detailed as possible). \n\n**1. Simple Rosemary oil (4/10)**\n\nHow long did I use it, and method:\n\nI used rosemary oil consistently for about 6 months. I diluted 5-7 drops of rosemary essential oil into a tablespoon of almond oil and massaged it into my scalp twice a week. I left it on for 1-2 hours before washing my hair with a mild shampoo. \n\nOther variables:\n\nMoved to a new country. Might have led to changes in water quality (only for the better!). Where I was originally staying the water was hard.  \n\nEffectiveness:\n\nLittle to negligible change (if at all). Still lost hair, but the silver lining is the rate of hair loss didn’t increase. Helped with scalp moisturization. Just about helped with hygiene and maintenance. \n\nResearch: there is a controversial paper online that compares its effects to minoxidil, but the jury is still out on this. \n\n**2. Rosemary + Castor Oil (5/10)**\n\nHow long did I use it, and method:\n\nGot influenced online (by some hairfluencer) and added castor oil to the above mix. Used for about 3-4 months. I mixed equal parts rosemary oil and cold-pressed castor oil, massaging it into my scalp twice a week. Pro-tip: castor oil is super thick which makes a tricky application, so I warmed the mixture slightly before use.\n\nOther variables:\n\nStarted trying to get in shape + reduced sugar significantly in my diet. New climate also dried my scalp pretty quick, so castor kind of worked okay for me on that front. \n\nEffectiveness:\n\nMy hair definitely appeared shinier, but there wasn’t any regrowth. Hair loss remained the same. Castor oil is a problem to get out of the hair and requires serious double/triple shampooing. Became too cumbersome after a point and the rewards did not justify the effort. \n\nResearch: Nothing conclusive on castor oil. Only heuristic evidence. \n\n**3. My mum’s DIY mask with a mix of herbs (Amla, Fenugreek, Hibiscus) (7/10)**\n\nHow long did I use it, and method:\n\nI entered my DIY phase (thanks to my mother, since I moved back in with her). For about 5 months, I experimented with weekly DIY masks. Basically was a paste made from amla and hibiscus powders mixed with fenugreek seed water (I soaked the seeds overnight). I applied this to my scalp and hair for 1-2 hours before rinsing it off.\n\nOther variables:\n\nDuring this time, I dealt with hard water again, which made rinsing out the masks a nightmare! I was back home temporarily, and stress was little higher than usual. Food might have lacked some proteins that I would usually access previously. \n\nEffectiveness:\n\nQuite decent! And also felt so satisfying to make. Effects were passable – made my hair felt soft, manageable, and glossy. Despite the hard water, saw visible reduction in hair loss. No change in hair density or growth. Somehow the effort of preparing and applying these masks weekly wasn’t justified (sorry mum!) but I still use them monthly,\n\nResearch: My mum’s ancient wisdom, which I dare not challenge. \n\n**4. Larch extracts - Redensyl (7/10)**\n\nHow long did I use it, and method:\n\nI used a Redensyl-based serum for 3 months, applying it every night before bed. I gently massaged a few drops into my scalp, focusing on thinning areas.\n\nOther variables:\n\nI was traveling frequently during this period, so my routine wasn’t always consistent. Despite this, I managed to apply the serum most nights. My diet had improved. Added significant amount of protein to my diet. \n\nEffectiveness:\n\nThings get interesting. Within 2 months I saw that shedding had reduced, which was encouraging. Nothing too dramatic on hair growth. But hair loss had reduced significantly by month 3, enough to take it as a serious contender. \n\nResearch: Interesting articles, which claim it could be as good as or even better than Minoxidil (I don’t trust research entirely nowadays, you never know what is backed by lobbies)\n\n**5.  (Larch extract) Redensyl + (Turmeric) Capilia Longa (9/10)**\n\nHow long did I use it, and method:\n\nUpgraded my previous serum to include turmeric extracts. I’ve been using this combo for over a year now, and it’s become a staple in my routine. I apply this serum every night and follow up with a gentle scalp massage.\n\nOther variables:\n\nI also consulted an ayurveda expert during this time and made wholesale changes to my lifestyle which definitely must have played a part here. Few key things - adjusted to the circadian rhythm. Quit a hectic job, moved to work from home. Woke up early (to take in the sun), slept early as soon as it turned dark. Started doing yoga to get more blood flow to the scalp. Regular meditation could have reduced cortisol levels significantly.\n\nEffectiveness:\n\nI think by month 5 or 6 my hair loss had nearly stopped. Saw improvement in regrowth for the first time in my life around this time—thicker, darker hair in thinning areas like temples. Even where there were thinning patches (on my crown) the density has increased. Big breakthrough for me. Continue to use this in my regime.\n\nResearch: Capilia Longa, too, has Clinical studies have show effectivenes of around 90%.  \n\n**6. Eclipta Alba + Licorice Root + Castor Oil (9/10)**\n\nHow long did I use it, and method:\n\nI’ve been using this alongside the serum in a oiling routine 2X a week for past 6 months. Initially used a simple bhringraj (eclipta alba) oil but switched to ready-made ayurvedic blend for convenience. \n\nOther variables:\n\nSame as above. Use gentle shampoos to wash this off. \n\nEffectiveness:\n\nHigh (but in tandem with the serum) + Lifestyle changes. My hair is nearly back to similar thickness as it was 3 years back. Hair oiling is a good way to meditate as well, while calming the scalp which also helps to reduce cortisol levels \n\nResearch: Nothing too concrete, some publications about effects on Male Albino Rats.",

Ordinary Multipeptide serum works very well when used in long run and is few proven actives. It has similar actives which you have mentioned above\n\n[Ordinary ](https://theordinary.com/en-in/multi-peptide-serum-for-hair-density-hair-scalp-treatment-100434.html)\n\nGot good reviews from my friends about the product from Dubai. Recommended.\n\n2. Scandinavian Biolabs is another company which has good hair products which performs better. Actives are also promising with right percentage. Don't know if it's available in India. \n\n[Scandinavian Biolabs](https://scandinavianbiolabs.com/)\n\nUsed it personally for 4 months reduced thinning and hair fall completely in 4 months. Had to stop because it's tough to order from Global website.\n\n3. This company is relative new in the market, but they have best actives. I would say hair growth complex which has scientific backing, few ingredients like Redensyl, Capilia Longa like mentioned above are there in right proportion. It's earlier to say how good it is, I have tried it once in Dubai. It does provide good results on hair fall control in 7 days. \n\nJust give it as try if you are in India or in UAE.\n\nSereneaura Hair growth\n Serum](https://www.thesereneaura.com/product/sereneaura-hair-growth-serum/))",

These are some tips that have helped 🙂\n\n• Stopped overly bleaching my hair \nhonestly this was hard because I started dying my hair at an early age, and felt like it needed to be colored to look decent. \n\n• Scalp oiling occasionally with rosemary oil You may need to double cleanse your hair if it’s on the thinner side. I also use biosilk coconut oil for my ends. very little goes a long way. \n\n• REDKEN PRODUCTS \nI cannot stress this enough. Redken acid bonding, all soft, and one united are my favs. My hair stopped breaking as much. \n\n• Hair gloss \nI notice my hair is more manageable when I do this. I recommend Redken and matrix glow mania. \n\n• Stopped asking for layers \nLayers were making my hair look stringy. The front of my hair looked thinner as well. Bleach was also a contributing factor to this. \n\n\nOf course having fine hair is still a pain. it’s more manageable when it’s healthier. I still struggle with putting my hair up in certain styles and my scalp showing a little. Honestly I’ve just learned to accept it now. I’m just happy to have healthy hair 🫶🏻\n\n\n",

    "body": "Now before I began if your notice anything wrong with your hair whether it seems like it is thinning, receding, very itchy, brittle, or whatever it is always a good idea to go see a doctor (preferably a dermatologist) and make sure you're adequately treated for your issue\\*\\*. It is best not to self-diagnose yourself based on what some random guy says on Reddit. Please consult with a medically trained professional before you do anything in this guide.\\*\\* Hair issues are not always the result of male pattern baldness(MPB) and it could be something totally unrelated.\n\n**My story-**\n\nBack in 2018 I distinctively remember styling my hair in the bathroom and while I was combing my hair I noticed there was a lot less hair on both sides of my temples. Upon closure inspection, I realized that my hairline was becoming more of an M shape and that my overall hair was a little fine/brittle. I went to the doctor to get checked out hoping for her to just tell me that it was like a maturing hairline or something, but to my shock, she told me that I had early signs of male pattern baldness. I thought that balding was not even something to start even worrying about until I was at least in my 40s and boy was I wrong. From that day forward I dedicated a lot of my time to talking with dermatologists, analyzing medical reports, reading people's testimonials, and surfing the forms of different reddits for the answers on saving my hair. Hopefully, this guide helps simplify hair loss for newbies just starting out and provide additional solutions to those who are on treatment that are still struggling.\n\n**Beginners starting out-**\n\nIn the world of hair loss, there is a ton of information out there and it can be extremely difficult to figure out what products you truly need versus the heavily advertised \"snake oil\" products that you don't need. If you have read any of the Reddit forms on r/tressless or other hair loss resources you might have heard people say ***\"Do The Big 3''***. The big three consist of the following products-\n\n1. Finasteride (also known as Propecia)\n2. 5% Topical Minoxidil (also known as Rogaine)\n3. 1% or 2% Ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# What do they do, how to get them, how to use them, where to buy them, and other tips/facts that will be useful to know.\n\n1. **Finasteride (Propecia)**\n\n**Finasteride** is the absolute first line of defense to protecting your hair and without it, you won't be able to target the root cause of your hair loss. From what we know DHT which is a byproduct of testosterone is targeting/killing your hair follicles by forcing them to shrink down until they are unable to produce any noticeable hair. Finasteride is an **FDA-approved** 5 alpha reductase inhibitor that is in charge of preventing the testosterone from converting into DHT at up to **70%** effectively. As a result, this should halt further progression of male pattern baldness and you might gain some hair back so long as you keep taking the pill. For application, all you have to do is take one pill a day and make sure to take it consistently. The most common dose for finasteride is 1mg, but some people take 0.25, 0.5 mg, and 1.25mg as well. In order to get this medication, you have to get it prescribed by your doctor, but more preferably dermatologist (since they specialize in hair loss). As far as if you should go to a local dermatologist or online, the choice is really up to you. On one hand, having a dermatologist nearby to treat you/do medical procedures is useful, but it comes at the cost of waiting for an appointment and traveling over to the office. On the other hand, an online dermatologist is fast/convenient since you can do it all from the comfort of your own home. However, it comes at the cost of potentially higher prices (Hims and keeps and getroman ) and dermatologists being limited to only prescribing medications and providing advice. The cheapest way I have found to get finasteride is to get the generic version of (Propecia) prescribed in person or by a normal dermatologist online **(not Hims and keeps or getroman)** and use Good RX at your local pharmacy. The cost was around $11 bucks a month for 30 tablets for me.\n\nIf you have done any research about finasteride, you most likely came across warnings about side effects or people's horror stories about their bodies reacting negatively to finasteride. Just like any other medication, there are always going to be some people who do not react favorably to certain drugs or medications. Fortunately, based on all studies we have, the percentage of men who experience any negative side effect was around 2.1% to 3.8%. **WHILE I AM NOT A DOCTOR**, if you do get bad side effects it would be a wise idea to maybe lower the dose from 1mg to 0.5 mg or 0.25 to see if your body reacts to it better. Another route you can take is to get finasteride in a different form such as the topical version where you apply the liquid to the head instead of taking the oral pill.\n\nThe last thing to mention about finasteride is that you have to be patient with it in order to see results. With the exception of a fake wig or a good hair transplant, it takes time/ consistency to see results from finasteride. As far as how long until you start seeing results, for some, it can be 4 months and for others, it can be as long as 2 years to start seeing results. It all depends on how good of a responder you are to the drug, so just be patient.\n\n**2. Topical Minoxidil 5% (Rogaine)**\n\nTopical minoxidil is an FDA-approved growth stimulant that works by shortening the telogen (resting) phase of your hair growth cycle and moving your hairs into the anagen (active growth) phase. A great way to think about this is a seed being given water to help it grow. Topical Minoxidil comes in two different forms, liquid and foam. The liquid is the cheapest of the two, however, it is known to be messy and irritating for quite a few people's scalps. Foam is more expensive however it is not anywhere as messy and is less likely to cause irritation to the scalp.\n\nFor application, you should apply Minoxidil two times a day to get the best results. The liquid version of the minoxidil is known to make your hair a bit greasy and also make your hair kinda clump together. As a result, this can kinda make the appearance that you are thinning/ balding more than you actually are. I would use a good quick dry foam version of minoxidil in the morning to keep your hair looking great and use the cheap liquid version before you go to bed at night. Maybe your hair does not do that but if it does that is a little trick you can try. As far as side effects other than it irritating some people's scalps there were really no common side effects that are reported by the vast majority of users. Unlike finasteride, you do not need to get a prescription for the doctor for the 5% version of topical minoxidil. You can buy it OTC (over the counter) at pretty much any store that carries simple medications.\n\n**(Keynote) There is a chance that you won't respond to Minoxidil, so in the second half, I explain 3 different ways to become more of an effective responder to Minoxidil.**\n\nThe cheapest I have found for a 6-month supply liquid version was a tie between either Sam's Club/ Costco at around $18 bucks. If you don't have a membership the second place I found was a tie between Walmart/Amazon for around $23 bucks. If your looking for a basic foam version 6-month supply, Walmart and Costco are the cheapest at both around $50 bucks.\n\nEven on the foam version, some people can not tolerate the minoxidil at all but luckily there are some other alternatives you can try instead. Some other options to look into are Rosemary oil, castor oil, and possibly oral minoxidil ( talk about the last treatment more in the second half).\n\n**(Keynote) It is not recommended to start both Finasteride and Topical minoxidil treatments at the same time since we won't know which treatment is actually working. I would start Finasteride first and wait around a year or so to see if any results come up then you will know if the Topical minoxidil is helping at all**\n\n**3. 1% or 2% Ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral)**\n\nOut of all the other shampoos that claim to \"restore\" hair loss Ketoconazole shampoo is the best in terms of the limited number of studies available on it. How it \"claims\" to work is it decreases the production of testosterone on the scalp which is known to convert into the byproduct DHT. With lower levels of testosterone available to create DHT, the hair follicles are a little bit healthier, denser, and fuller. The shampoo comes in either 1% or 2% and as for how to get them, both versions will be different. The 1% called (Nizoral) can be bought over the counter at pretty much any main steam store. However, the 2% version has to be prescribed by a dermatologist. It is not clear whether the 2% is more effective than the 1%, however, it is worth pointing out that the studies used 2% Ketoconazole shampoo in the testing. while Ketoconazole shampoo sounds great in theory, it is either a hit or miss product for most people. Some people get decent results with it, while other people find it not really doing much for them. I say it is at least worth trying out since a 7-ounce bottle on amazon costs around only $15 bucks.\n\nMost users recommend that you use Ketoconazole shampoo 2 to 3 times a week and leave it on your hair for 5 to 10 min so that it can soak into your scalp. Some users use their own personal shampoo after applying Ketoconazole, but most would agree to apply conditioner after to make sure your hair does not dry up.\n\nI have to give credit to u/Rawtashk on his 2020 updated guide hair guide for explaining everything extremely well, but most importantly for explaining to the new users \"How will I know if it's working?\" and \"How long until I see results?\". I won't really be able to explain it much better than Rawtashk did so ill be pasting his response here as well as a link to his guide at the end.\n\nfrom u/Rawtashk\n\n\" How will I know if it's working?\n\nYou will most likely get a hair shed. It will freak you out at first, but it is almost certainly a positive thing. Your hair will shed and it will regrow and be thicker and stronger. It is not a scientific approach, but I absolutely recommend getting a hair snare for your shower and putting it down every time you wash your hair. You need something with very small holes so your hair doesn't slip through them,[ this is the one that I use](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PSDGNA)\n\nYou don't need to set this down in the drain if you have a flat drain of if it doesn't fit, just flip it over so it's sticking up and the water will still drain and it will still catch your hairs. This is just to monitor the general amount of hair that's lost when you shampoo. ***DO NOT SIT THERE AND COUNT EVERY HAIR***, it will be different every time because there are a ton of factors that would cause more or less hair on a daily basis. All you're looking for is the general volume of hair that's left after you shower. You should notice it slowing down over the course of many months. This is a long process, not overnight results, be patient. When I first started there would be substantial amounts of hair left, but now it's down to maybe 20ish or so.\"\n\n\" How long until I see results?\n\nAt least a year, maybe more. Again, this takes time, so be patient. Your follicles will have to shed and regrow a slightly thicker hair several different hair cycles. Personally it was probably 12 months before I could personally see changes, and probably 18-20 months before the changes were really apparent in pictures. This is not an overnight fix, it will take time.\n\nYou will also go through shedding phases, try not to freak out. First time it happened to me I was convinced that maybe the Fin I got was fake and I was losing all my progress. The shed lasted for 3-4 weeks or so, then the hairfall went back to normal. I wouldn't have realized any of this if I wasn't using that hair snare and able to monitor what was going on.\n\nHair sheds don't bother me anymore, but it took many years. I would always get stressed out once or twice a year whenever they happened, but the last 4 years or so I just shrug. In fact, I rarely even put the hair catch down anymore because it doesn't really concern me.\"\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Now onto the second half - Those who are on the big 3 protocol, yet still experiencing (MLB) or are not satisfied with the results they got.\n\nMale pattern baldness is a tricky beast to tame because certain medications may work better for some people, but may not work at all for other people. In order for some individuals to combat their hair loss, they will need to do more treatments, upgrade to stronger medications, and add more protocols to their routine/stack. Now the goal is not to use every single possible treatment for hair loss known in the medical literature, but to use enough to be able to get back our hair and see the results we want. The good news is beyond \"The Big Three\" there are many other treatment options that may be worth trying out, but the bad news is it's a game of trial/error and patience.\n\n1. **Dutasteride**\n\nFor those who have been on Finasteride for a while (1.5 years or more) you are probably wondering why you are still thinning/receding/balding even though this drug is supposed to work wonders with protecting your hair. As great as Finasteride is, it has its shortcomings due to the amount maximum amount of DHT it can block. Studies show that Finasteride can block **up to 70%** of the DHT and while that's great there is 30% or more DHT still in your system. Unfournalty even though you have gotten rid of well over half of the DHT in your body, the remaining DHT is still attacking your hair. Dutasteride is another 5 alpha reductase inhibitor approved for hair loss in both South Korea and Japan. What makes Dutasteride different from Finasteride is that it blocks **90% or more** of the DHT which makes it a more effective/potent solution to halt the (MPB). In order to get this medication, you have to get prescribed by your dermatologist. Because this drug is not approved by the FDA in the U.S.(other countries as well) and it is not as well known as Finasteride your dermatologist may not be too keen on prescribing it to you. Personally, I had to go to 3 different dermatologists before one was willing to prescribe me it. Maybe it was just bad luck for me, but just know that it might be harder to get Dutasteride. The application is the same as Finasteride, and it either comes in a tablet or a capsule at a **0.5 mg dose**. Due to the drug not being FDA (yet), a lot of the online dermatology companies (including Hims, keeps, and getroman) do not offer Dutasteride as an option. The only two ways that I know of are to either to see a dermatologist in person or online and speak with a regular online dermatologist. The cheapest I found for getting Dutasteride was the exact same method I did for Finasteride. The price for me was around $14 bucks at my local pharmacy using good RX.\n\nAs far as any negative side effects it is pretty much the same as Finasteride, but since it is more potent, the chances of negative side effects go up a little. If you are getting bad side effects from the Dutasteride pill there is a topical version that you can use that users have said give them fewer side effects, but again everyone reacts differently.\n\n**(Keynote) There are some pharmacies out there that can take the different topical medications and combine them together so that it makes applying topically less of a hassle. Examples that you may find are Finasteride+minoxidil, Dutasteride+minoxidil, Finasteride+minoxidil+tretinoin, etc.**\n\nJust like I mentioned with Finasteride, your going to have to be patient with Dutasteride to do its job. Although since it is a more powerful medication you might see results faster than you would have seen with Finasteride.\n\n2. **Topical Minoxidil 5% with Mirconeedling and Tretinoin.**\n\nTopical minoxidil is one of the safest and most effective treatments we have as a growth stimulant. However, studies on its efficacy showed that **only 40% to 60% respond positively** (depending on which study you look at) to the treatment. Now the question is why is it that around half of the users are unsuccessful with the medication? Well, we think it has to do with if you have enough of the sulfotransferase enzymes in the scalp. Half of the people do not have enough of the needed enzymes in order for the minoxidil to do its job. Now there are two ways to help people to become better responders to topical minoxidil that are backed up by studies.\n\n**Micro needling for hair loss** is the process of puncturing small holes into the scalp in order to encourage the body to heal/grow new hairs and to allow for better absorption of topical medications. There are three different types of micro needling derives you can use- (derma pen) (derma roller) and (derma stamp). The vast majority of users recommend the derma pen since it is a motorized pen machine that punctures needles precisely to the depth you want in the scalp. The most common protocol is to microneedle once every 1 to 2 weeks at a 1.5-millimeter depth. Yes, there are many different protocols out there that have different frequencies and needle depth lengths, your just going to have to find one that works best for you. As far as what is the best best \"derma pen\" out there the 2 big ones you hear about in the Reddit forms are (Dr pen) and (derminator 2). I think they both do great, it's just a matter of preference of what you think is best for you. There are a bunch of different Dr pen's out there such as the M8, A6, and N2, you just have to find one that fits your budget. They cost anywhere from $35 bucks to $180 bucks depending on what accessories you get and where you buy them from. Do not buy them for Dr.pen..com, Dr.penUSA..com, and maybe Amazon (their prices are stupid high. People who have bought pens from the first two websites mentioned have had scamming issues, faulty products, poor customer service, and a host of other issues. The best place to buy Dr. pens from is going to be eBay since they have a great customer protection/return policy and decent delivery times. Aliexpress is another place that other Reddit users have said is a good place to buy as well, however, it takes a long time for it to get delivered but the prices are a bit better than eBays. The derminator 2 can only be bought from vaughter wellness..com and the cost is going to be around $200.\n\n**Tretinoin** is a medication that is used to help fight acne and other skin problems. However, there were multiple studies showing that a small amount of tretinoin that was applied to the hair or mixed with other topicals, helped aid in hair growth. It is important to note that just like Ketoconazole shampoo, tretinoin is a hit more miss for people that use it for hair loss. There is a debate about whether or not it actually helps versus whether it is doing more harm than good. Some people say that adding tretinoin helps them grow back their hair while others said that it made it worse. I would encourage you to do more research on your own and decide for yourself if you think the benefits outweigh the potential cons. Tretinoin has to be prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist. Not sure how much it costs but other users have said it really cheap to get.\n\n**2A. Oral minoxidil**\n\nA lot of people don't like the idea of applying topical minoxidil and having to deal with all the hassle that comes with it. So Minoxidil can come in the form of a pill like oral Finasteride or Dutasteride. Because it is not being applied to the scalp area, the oral minoxidil runs through your body systemically. Studies have shown that people respond to oral minoxidil better than topical since the process of where the enzymes are being converted is happening in the liver instead of the scalp. More of the needed sulfotransferase enzymes are found in higher concentrations in the liver so because of that it works better to grow more hairs.\n\nNow if oral minoxidil is so effective, why isn't it marketed/ recommended by dermatologists more? Well because the minoxidil is running systemically through your body and not just applied to your head so the chances of negative/unwanted side effects goes up. Most people experience Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) but there are some that get negative side effects like low blood pressure, heart irregularities, and headaches. So it is important to make sure that you are using the daily recommended amount that your dermatologist sets for you. If you do get bad side effects, like Finasteride you can reduce the dosage to reduce the negative effects. Unlike topical minoxidil, the oral version has to be prescribed by your dermatologist. Because of the uptick in potential negative side effects/ not being FDA approved for hair loss, not all dermatologists will prescribe it to you. If you are not a good responder to the topical minoxidil even with micro needling/ tretinoin added or you don't want to go through all the hassle, oral minoxidil may be a good option for you. The cheapest way I found to get it will be the same way as Finasteride and Dutasteride.\n\n**3. Hair Transplant**\n\nA good/successful hair transplant is one of the most effective treatments that you can do fix your hair loss. Now in order for a person to be a good candidate for a hair transplant procedure an honest/ reputable dermatologist will have to examine several things. The first thing to know is **a hair transplant does not cure hair loss** and if you haven't stabilized your thinning, receding, or balding, you won't have a long-lasting set of hair complete hair. While The newly transplanted hairs are not vulnerable to the (MPB), the original remaining hairs still are. So until you have halted the (MPB) process you will continue to recede in the original hair areas. The dermatologist won't want to perform the procedure until they have a good idea of where the receding is going to end and that is why the mentioned medications/protocols above are critical for long-lasting hair. The second thing to know is you have to have enough healthy \"donor's hairs\" in order to be able to have a transplant. Hair transplant surgeons like using the hairs from the back/ sides of the head since they are more DHT proof and have the best success rate of having a good hair transplant.\n\nThe cost of a hair transplant is substantially higher than the other medications/protocols mentioned above. The cost can be anywhere from $2,000 bucks all the way up to past $15,000 bucks. When it comes to how much should you spend, this is not something to shop around for the best price but to find a reputable hair transplant surgeon. The number of donor hairs you have available is not unlimited, so the procedure needs to be done right the first time so that you don't exhaust additional donor hairs to fix cheap hair transplant mistakes. The cost to do a transplant is very high in the U.S and the UK so countries like Turkey and South Korea have become popular destinations due to the costs of hair transplants being much lower. Wherever you choose to go you need to do your research and make sure that they have your best interest at heart. There need to be a clear understanding and communication happening so that you are happy with the results you get. Hair transplants take around 6 to 12 months for transplanted hairs to start regrowing and act like normal hair.\n\nThere are so many other options that I have not talked about, but if you want to look into other potential hair loss treatments/helpers here are some others to look into-\n\n**Low Lazer Light Therapy, Platelet-rich plasma injections, Topical dutasteride, Topical finasteride Rosemary oil, castor oil, ru58841, vitamin D supplements, saw palmetto, realistic toupee/wigs, and micro pigmentation surgery.**\n\nHere are **youtube channels** that are well worth looking at that go deeper into each other the medications/ treatments/ protocols/ procedures that I talk about in the guide.\n\n\\-**Derek More Plates More Dates**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/MorePlatesMoreDates](https://www.youtube.com/c/MorePlatesMoreDates)\n\n\\-**The Hairloss show**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHairLossShow](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHairLossShow)\n\n\\- **Dr. Gary Linkov**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXHS7RSRMGcVp4-MMbEDW6g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXHS7RSRMGcVp4-MMbEDW6g)\n\n**-Dr. Dray**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/DrDrayzday](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrDrayzday)\n\n**-Hair Gaurd**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/Hairguard](https://www.youtube.com/c/Hairguard)\n\n**- HAIRLICIOUSLY**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/hairliciously](https://www.youtube.com/c/hairliciously)\n\nHere is a link to u/Rawtashk 2020 hair loss guide-[ https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/f5wvdn/2020\\_updated\\_guide\\_for\\_im\\_losing\\_my\\_hair\\_what\\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/f5wvdn/2020_updated_guide_for_im_losing_my_hair_what_do/)\n\nHere is a link to the u/tressless Wiki index, I goes deep into all the hair loss treatments known in this subreddit:[ http://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/wiki/index](http://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/wiki/index)",

    "body": "The other day, I was down another rabbit hole of Careprost for lashes and found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ky9ece/24_days_progress_rosemary_and_peppermint_oil_and/gjfaxsy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) very useful comment on r/HaircareScience\n\nTl;DR: Key points-\n\n1. Rosemary oil is as effective as minoxidil for hair growth\n2. Castor oil as a carrier oil for all packs due to it's anti-fungal, conditioning & growth boosting properties\n3. Other oils & ingredients to be added as per concern\n\n\\[Crosspost\\]Several years ago, after reading up a lot on Rosemary Oil and finding it is a common ingredient in many regrowth serums, I have been using it with a variation of Castor Oil hair masks, some also with Peppermint Oil. I've been using my masks for roughly 4 years now and my hair is completely different and no longer concerns me.\n\nI have shared this a few times elsewhere so copy and pasting the relevant parts (after a lot, a lot of research), where brows and lashes were more the focus; I use only pure Castor Oil on my lashes and the other hair mask mixtures on my brows. Also I was using a hair mask weekly to every 10 days for the first 2 years or so, then 3 times a month for roughly a year, and now (coming up on 2 years) I use one every 2-3 weeks.\n\nWarning **LONG** post.\n\nI combine the mixture into two 30ml or one 60ml dropper bottles (ratios dependent on hair length) since it can be mixed/shaken well and I find it to be the easiest/least messy way to apply it in sections (I also warm the bottle(s) in a mug of hot tap water for about 5-7 minutes prior for the hot oil effect), starting at the roots and moving my way down to the tips. I always massage it into my scalp for a good 10+ minutes once done, I use a gentle, non-stripping shampoo and wash twice to get it all out/prevent weighing it down. (I aim to use it where I don't need to style my hair the following day to give it a break and honestly it's too soft to hold most styles I've found and just leave it with only a bit of leave-in conditioner). I buy a pack of [100 disposable shower caps](http://imgur.com/a/bm3CO8c) from Amazon for around $3-$5 too to make using the masks really easy. I'll use one of the below masks...\n\n**• Castor Oil & Aloe Vera Hair Mask**\n\n*For a nourished and healthy scalp, conditions hair, adds shine and strength and promotes growth. I use 70% Castor Oil and 30% Aloe (I prefer Lily of the Desert) and ideally left overnight but I aim for a minimum 2 hours, I use a disposable shower cap. It's a very gentle and soothing mask. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Fractioned Coconut Oil Hair Mask**\n\n*Ideal for thin (thinning) hair, to get healthier, thicker and stronger hair, also promotes growth. I mix 60:40 oils and leave on for 45 minutes to an hour, wrapped in a hot/warm towel. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil, Egg & Honey Mask**\n\n*For split ends, damaged and unruly hair; promotes growth, nourishes and tames, also helps with an irritated scalp; it's very deep conditioning. I use 1 egg, 8 tablespoons of castor oil, and 2 tablespoon of honey (I warm the honey slightly to mix it in easier). Leaving it on for approximately an hour, wrapped with a shower cap and a hot/warm towel over top. Note: Once honey is mixed, it is not the sticky mess you would anticipate and it's not at all difficult to wash away either.*\n\n***Re: Eggs***\n\n>*\"For normal hair use the entire egg to condition, use egg whites only to treat oily hair; use egg yolks only to moisturize dry brittle hair.\"*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Sweet Almond Oil Hair Mask**\n\n*Perfect for thin and/or lifeless hair, again promotes growth and is a deeply nourishing mask and adds bounce. I use a 60% and 40% ratio. Best left on overnight wrapped initially with a hot/warm towel for an hour and then with a disposable shower cap if leaving on overnight. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Water Hair Mask**\n\n*This one is easiest to make obviously and comes with the same benefits of thick, shiny and strong hair, along with regrowth. I use approximately 10+ tablespoons oil and 2-3 tablespoons of water to thin it and help it spread easier. Leaving it on for two hours minimum, overnight is great too from my experience. (Rosemary Oil optional...I sometimes add in Peppermint Oil as well which also stimulates follicles.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Argan Oil Hair Mask**\n\n*This mask is highly moisturizing, helps strengthen strands, less breakage and less fallout will be noticed, promotes hair growth, bounce and shine and is nourishing for the scalp. I use a 50:50 ratio and leave it on anywhere from 1 hour (with a hot towel) to overnight (with a shower cap). (Rosemary and Peppermint Oil optional, I personally always add both to this mask.)*\n\n**• Castor Oil & Ylang Ylang Mask**\n\n*\"This mask is an effective natural treatment to reduce hair fall out caused by stress and alopecia. When it is massaged into the hair follicles, it stimulates hair growth and is a natural way to treat thinning hair according to studies.\" I mix a 70:30 ratio and leave it on for an hour, wrapped in a warm towel. (Rosemary Oil optional.)*\n\nWhere I've said **\"Rosemary Oil Optional\"**, I do add it in, (often with Peppermint Oil as well), after finding it's either a very common ingredient (as is Castor Oil) or performs similarly to hair regrowth serums (I'll generally add in 10-15 drops based on my ratios (or roughly 8 and 8 drops if adding in both Peppermint and Rosemary Oils...**if unfamiliar or new to EOs, I highly recommend a patch test that is mixed with a carrier oil and only a couple of drops added**): \n\n>*\"If you want to improve both hair thickness and hair growth, rosemary oil is a great choice thanks to its ability to improve cellular generation. According to studies, rosemary oil performed as well as minoxidil, a common hair growth treatment, but with less to no scalp itching as a side effect.\"*\n\n***Note re:*** *oil substitutions, in place of Sweet Almond, Fractioned Coconut, Ylang Ylang or Argan Oils (or perfectly fine added in/combined if preferred), Sesame, Grapeseed, Avocado and/or Jojoba Oils have all shown similar hair and scalp health benefits. I'll mix and match whatever I have on hand or if out of one of them but Castor Oil is always the main base.*\n\n**Castor oil’s antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal properties make it an effective treatment for scalp infections, dandruff and/or irritations including dry or oily scalp. Also it's strengthening, shine boosting, conditioning and promoting of hair growth, it dramatically improves fallout too from my experience and is usually one of the main ingredients in hair regrowth systems/serums. Although I have tried and liked many,** [**this Castor Oil**](http://imgur.com/a/uU4qvGY) **is my favourite one that I always go back to and have now solely used for the last 2 years.**\n\nLastly: For realistic expectations since I know many who tried it for a few weeks to a month and didn't see results fast enough and/or weren't consistent; I've been using castor oil for hair, brows and lashes for around 4 years now. After a couple of weeks, everything simply looked healthier with added shine. After 1 month I started seeing baby hairs growing in where there weren't any previously, my hair stopped falling out at such a high rate, often I would brush my hair and be really surprised to see maybe 2 strands in the brush vs a huge handful, it was also feeling stronger and had a lot of body, lashes looked lengthened and brows looked mildly fuller. At 3 months my hair was definitely thicker and stopped falling out completely, other than normal shedding. It was at the 6 month mark my hair had grown in length quite significantly, it was healthy, very strong, shiny, had bounce to it and was much, much thicker...my brows were full again and no sparse areas, lashes were longer and fuller as well. (I applied nightly to brows and lashes, I use [these tubes](http://imgur.com/a/pAOK2DC) from AliExpress, also available on Amazon for just a bit more, which were quite cheap.)\n\nI hope this helps! :)\n\nShoutout to u/therealmrsbrady for sharing her routine.",

I haven’t straightened it in years but I still don’t know how to tame it or make it look better, I braid it every night so it looks like waves instead of this. It was last bleached two years ago, still feels a bit dead and I just got layers a couple months ago. The images attached is air dried after showering. I so badly want it to not be this large and messy. It gets so thick and frizzy I ALWAYS wear half of it up in a clip, I just wish I could leave it all down and not feel bombarded. I want it to look soft and luscious, I don’t know where I’m going so wrong, any advice is appreciated!!\n\nProducts I use every shower in order:\nShampoo: “Tea Tree Triple Threat Invigorating Shampoo by Giovanni”\nConditioner: “Shea Moisture strengthen & restore conditioner”\nLeave in conditioner:  “Blueberry bliss reparative leave in conditioner” \n“Verb curl cream” \n“Goddess strength 7 oil blend”\n“Olaplex number 6”\n“rosemary oil”",

        "body": "It does seem like you might be using too many protein products for every wash day; protein-moisture balance is KEY to bouncy, juicy, clumpy, less-frizz curls. Swapping out either the Shea reparative or Bliss reparative (“reparative” or “strengthen” on a product is a good indicator that it contains protein and/or coconut) for a moisture-rich, no-coconut, no protein conditioner or (leave-in, whichever you decide to switch) would help a lot to get your curls more moisturized, clumped, shiny, and “juicy.” When things get limp or over-moisturized, add more protein your next wash day. A suggestion though: change just one product at a time! (So you can judge what works and what doesn’t & you can better pinpoint efficacy of new or subtracted ingredient/product.) It’s trial and error and learning your own hair.\n\nFor example, I have virgin, never-flat-ironed,  never-dyed hair that appreciates protein SPARINGLY, so I have protein only in my curl cream. When I have lost curl definition and bounce, I’ll do a protein-containing mask like, 2-3x per year, but only now as I’ve got hair your length (so it receives more manual/manipulation/physical damage; I didn’t do this when I had a curly bob). Just something I’ve learned in the last 10 years of CGM about **my** curls. My hair also does not tolerate coconut oil (it gives my hair the over-proteined straw feel) so I avoid that as well but YMMV! There isn’t really a one-size fits all.\n\nCurl cream is also a good bet for our curl-type, but you might try it in combo with gel if you want more definition/less pouf. I also have long hair like yours and I distribute my curl cream throughout my hair upside down in the shower (with a shower brush), rake and scrunch then plop. I shake out my hair after 20ish minutes, arrange it with a pick & then I gloss the outer perimeter of my hair with gel before air-drying until cast is formed. (Then I diffuse upside down but I WANT volume.) Scrunch out the crunch with an oil. HTH! Your hair is gorgeous! I hope you’ll embrace it!",

I have absurdly similar hair to yours and would use switch up basically all of your products.\n\nYou'll want a less harsh shampoo... even just a different shampoo from the same line would be fine-- like the Giovanni Smooth as Silk or 50:50 Balanced shampoo would be better. Then you'll want to use lighter but still nourishing conditioner for dense wavy/curly hair. The matching conditioner in the Giovanni line could work--especially the Smooth as Silk. \n\nI personally prefer and have had the best results with the following shampoos and conditioners and rotate between them depending on need, but they are at a higher price point...just putting that out there fwiw:\n\nInnersense Hydrating Cream Hairbath (personal current favorite general/everyday shampoo)\n\nOuidad Bond Building shampoo (you may not need this one as it's for damaged hair but if you feel like you have heat damage you should consider it!) \n\nDavines Solu shampoo (highly recommend having one clarifying shampoo to reset with once every few weeks, be it this one or some other one...but this is a great one)\n\nInnersense Hydrating Cream Conditioner (personal current favorite general/everyday shampoo)\n\nOuidad Bond Building Conditioner (same note as matching shampoo from this line...if you feel you have damage adding these two your collection would be a great idea. I liked them MUCH more than Olaplex and other competitors)\n\nYou're also going to want to switch up the styling products. I recommend not using a cream-type leave in conditioner and instead use a lighter spray leave-in like the Innersense Sweet Spirit Leave In. When I do feel like I need more oomph on the ends I also love Davines Curl Building Serum. I would also recommend not using a curl cream at all. You pointedly don't need to use both a leave-in conditioner and a curl cream--if you keep a curl cream you should drop a leave-in conditioner. BUT, my recommendation would be to drop the curl cream and use a lighter leave-in. Then you'll want to use a higher hold gel or mousse. On a budget or a pinch, the LA Hold Styling Gel by Giovanni definitely works, though I prefer the Innersense I Create Hold gel or Ouidad Advanced Climate Control gel. Gels like these are going to give you much better definition and a sleeker look to your curls than a cream and help you get the \"soft & luscious\" look you're aspiring towards.\n\nI hope this helps!

But I've been throwing myself fully into exercise and lifestyle changes to claw back as much control of my brain as I can, and now my energy levels are better than they have been since I was a teenager. I haven't had coffee in months.\n\nExercise\n\n-Get a step counter and walk at least 8k steps a day. Try for 10k. this seriously does so much. If you live in a place with bad weather or walking infrastructure, get a walking pad.\n\n-lift weights. Legs, chest, back, arms. I have a spare room where I stuck a cheap craigslist weight bench and about 200 bucks of barbells and dumbbells. Sure, getting a gym membership is more practical for some people, but for me I know I will work out more with a set at home. It's a nice feeling when I stick some protein in the oven and can just pump out a few sets by the time my food is ready.\n\n-hike/spend time in nature. Aromatic turpentines in forests are shown to have massive positive benefits on emotional regulation.\n\nDiet/lifestyle\n\n-cut out alch, nictotine, weed, processed foods, soda, processed sugar as much as you can. For me, weed was fucking up my mental state, memory, and sleep cycle. I feel way more energy and mental clarity without it. And i can breathe easier without smoking. It's maybe made more of a difference for me than anything.\n\n-focus your diet around getting as wide of a range of micronutrients as possible. Vitamin A (carrots/squash), Vitamin Bs (too much to go into for me rn) Vitamin C (citrus or lots of other fruit), Vitamin E (nuts), Vitamin K (lots of vegetables). Foods like kale are great bc they knock out a lot of your vitamin needs at once (it has A, C, and K I believe).\n\n-avoid plastic if possible. Don't drink out of cans and plastic bottles, don't eat canned food (plastic apoxy). Ironically frozen vegetables in plastic packagaing often have less plastic in them than canned food.\n\n  \n-spoonful of ginger and spoonful of chia every day\n\n-incorporate antioxidant rich superfoods whenever possible. I especially recommend purple (skin and flesh) Japanese sweet potatoes, blueberries, kale, avocado. Moringa is the healthiest plant I know of (and I am a horticulturalist by training), you might find it at a farmer's market but i buy it dried and drink it as tea.\n\n-if you eat meat, supplement protein needs with plant protein like chickpeas.\n\n-if you are going to eat processed foods, there is a big difference between pasta/bread/hummus vs. twinkees/hohos/etc\n\nSupplements\n\n-magensium glycinate for sleep\n\n-b12\n\n-d3 (maybe take half doses if you get decent amounts of sun, I tested a little high last time I did bloodwork)\n\nSleep\n\n-find the gentlest lighting possible\n\n-wear blue light glasses as much as possible\n\n-get an essential oil diffuser with tree oils to lower your heartrate\n\n-exercise will make things much easier\n\n-air purifier\n\n-black out curtains\n\nSkincare\n\n-sunscreen every day. avoid it out of plastic if possible bc plastic is not good for your skin\n\n-wear a hat outside\n\n-I make an aloe vera gel harvested from the plant and mix with green tea/moringa/Macha. Then i take the leftover stalks, soak them in warm water and pour it over my head in the bath. Did away with my dandruff overnight.\n\n-ricewater, for skin and hair\n\n-retinol\n\nHair\n\n-gugo bark shampoo if you can get it is said to fight hair loss\n\n-rosemary oil encourages hair growth\n\n-rice water\n\n-I wash my hair with squash water (yes, water I boiled squash in) before shampooing with gugo bark shampoo. Vitamin A contains retinol. After I did that my girlfriend said my hair had never looked shinier.\n\nTea\n\n-for caffeine I go with green tea or yerba mate\n\n-non caffeine mix (which I add to the green tea/yerb sometimes as well) is moringa, nettle, and stevia leaf\n\n-if you have a sweet tooth, stevia leaf can be a great sugar replacement.\n\nlmk what you think or if you think of anything",

    "body": "Hi sisters! This is for the girlies struggling with hair fall and thinning hair. This community has been so helpful to me so I thought of finally sharing what worked for my hair problems. \n\nI’ve been dealing with severe hair fall and thinning since 2013 after a bad rebond that completely damaged my hair. Over the years, I’ve tried countless products and consulted several dermatologists, but nothing really worked for me. I also avoided Minoxidil since I read that it’s harmful to cats, and with so many fur babies at home, I didn’t want to take any risks.\n\nI can’t afford a hair transplant or expensive hair treatments, so I’ve always experimented with different organic oils I found online, hoping to find something that works. After years of trial and error, here’s what finally helped me:\n\nDomus Naturae\nStarted using: August 2024\nI apply this to my scalp 1 hour before showering, twice a week.\nThe scent is strong and organic. intense for my sensitive nose so I can only leave it on for an hour.\nNo bad reactions so far.\nProgress is slow, but I can see a real difference! I have more baby hairs now, and my hair looks healthier.\n\nMediall Scalp Strengthening Essence\nStarted using: December 2024\nI spray this on my scalp every other day after showering.\nHas a light scent that fades quickly.\nMakes my hair feel super smooth.\nReduced my hair fall significantly. Way more than when I was only using Domus Naturae\n\nCurrent Shampoo & Conditioner\nShampoo: Herbal Essences Argan Shampoo\nConditioner: Vitakeratin Deep Repair Treatment\n\nOther products that helped with hair fall (but not hair thickening):\nHuman Nature Rosemary Oil & Shampoo (Used this for years before switching to Herbal Essences Argan Shampoo)\nThe Ordinary Multipeptide Serum\nCatt & Co Hair Serum (Smells amazing!)\n\nI still have a long way to go, but I’m more confident now. I can finally go out without wearing a cap, and my scalp isn’t as visible as before!\n\nI hope these products work for you too if you decide to try them. Let’s keep supporting each other on this journey!",

I have never seen a dermatologist, (I don’t plan on going so please spare me-I do not have health insurance and cannot get it anytime soon) \n\nI’ve only been using minoxidil (Kirkland brand) and rosemary oil to help with my flakey scalp. Along with nizoral shampoo. I wash my hair almost every day. \n\nI don’t care what the box says, I use probably 5 times the amount to cover the entirety of my scalp. \n\nIt has even grown back my hair line from years of damage from glue because wearing a wig was my only option \n\nIf you too are struggling I say give it a try. I still have a long while to go. But I have never had hope for my hair until I started minoxidil. \n\nI wish I would’ve started sooner. Don’t give up. I almost did. \n\n(A small warning, it will absolutely make the hair on your face more noticeable. So get comfortable with shaving or waxing.) ",

Bake 40-50 mins at 450° F (approx 230° C), flipping halfway.\n\n1. Return potatoes to bowl with reserved garlic and rosemary. Toss again.\n\nYou could achieve the same result by parboiling the potatoes in a pot, but I find that using stock makes them taste better and that I have to pay less attention to them with this method.",

I felt like I was idolizing my hair for tooooooo long and I felt like my hair made me who I am. I was so focus on my hair I felt like I wasn’t loving myself so I did something big and just buzzed all my hair. Am I mad at it? No way! Do I regret it? Not at all! I feel happier and I feel better about myself. I’m learning to love myself even more. ❤️\n\nHair products I used that work well on my hair type: \n\nKinky Curl leave in \nMiele rosemary oil (listen it didn’t do damage to my hair so to each its own) \nSelsun Medicated shampoo \nMiele conditioner \nDoo Gro oil (mega thick growth oil) \n\nAny question or comments I’m happy to answer all ❤️ \n\nMuch love \n",

    "body": "Hi. I’ve been browsing for a year now, first time posting on this, please mind the messy formats. \nI have severe OCD amongst other disappointing illnesses. for a while my impulse was picking skin, now I guess it’s hair. I’ve had extremely long and pretty healthy hair for my whole life. I had a breakdown a while back that made me do impulsive shit with my hair to cope with my crumbling self-esteem and dysmorphia. Yes, I know bleach is horrible for your hair. I was young and dumb and lived in whatever feeling I got when I would “reinvent” myself while doing this. I would get in trouble for picking my skin, so thought this was the next best thing to fidget on. \nBasically, reality has set in and I really fucked up. I can’t wear my hair down at all. I don’t feel like an ethereal princess anymore. The days I felt so insecure, there was no reason to be. I always wear my hair up in a silk scrunchie or claw clip. I can barely braid one side from the breakage. \nI know this doesn’t happen overnight, but any guidance to regain my confidence and long locks back will have me blissful. I hardly ever wanna look at my reflection, it just pisses me off that I let myself go to this level. How long do you think it would take for my hair to fully grow back? The blonde is fairly healthy, but the underneath and bleached side gets very fragile. I’ve chopped it to the same length before, but that side doesn’t retain the length. I have my hair up constantly so I haven’t bothered anything besides s+d.\n\nMy routine: scalp massages 3-4min every day, rosemary oil before every wash (2-3 days) I use redken extreme lengths. Hair mask or redken bonding concentrate, rinse conditioner w cool water, dry with microfiber towel or cotton shirt. Leave in conditioner, olaplex bonding oil (use on damp and everyday dry on ends). Sometimes I will use redken extreme bleach repair cream. Air dry. I sleep in a loose bun and use a silk pillowcase. Wet brush or bristle on dry hair, comb starting from ends. Search and destroy whenever I see it. Biotin and collagen supplements daily. I eat a vegan diet since 2020.",

If it’s something you’d consider I’d use a color depositing conditioner to get it all to a solid darker color & just leave it alone.\n\nA silk cap might be better than the pillow case depending on how much you move around during sleep. \n\nProtein, vitamin D & iron are important for hair growth so make sure you’re getting enough. \n\nSorry this happened to you, it sucks. I absolutely destroyed my hair about a year ago with bleach. A ton of it broke off & it looked so horrible. I cut it to about shoulder length & dyed it darker.

I would henna the length and ONLY cut the bangs. I was aloud to dye my bangs whatever color I wanted because I was free to cut them off whenever they got too damaged or I just needed a change. Hair masks or an oil treatment or new hairstyle when feeling impulsive. Maybe you can redirect the OCD with concentrating on hair health? Getting/making hair products. I had red hair with blonde bangs, neon pink, etc. I still got to dye my hair and it looked fun and the length stayed healthy. \n\n I wish you luck!

K18 is a miracle worker and I highly suggest that to prevent future damage as well. I would stop putting any color/bleach in it. I think the color now is pretty. If you don't like how it blends with your natural color, I would have a salon do some demi-permanent low lights that match your roots so you can grow it out without a demarcation line. Use a silk pillowcase, and oil the ends while it is damp. You want to seal in moisture, and not prevent it from getting into your hair.",

Actually came out great.  Second round I decided to do the roots myself cos I was a broke student.  I had no idea what I was doing, or that you’re not supposed to go over the bleach line.  Got in the shower to wash it out and some of it started snapping out in clumps - about an inch and a half from the root. Continued to be very thin, snapping easily, etc.  \n\nEventually, I dyed it back brown, lopped off as much as I could (to about chin length), kept getting regular cuts, and began using overnight scalp & hair treatments.  I kept up the maintenance after I was able to grow it all out to my natural hair. It is the healthiest it’s ever been: growing really fast, soft, and shiny.\n\nSo, even though this is really hard right now & I can imagine is affecting self-esteem amongst other things, you don’t need to worry so much about permanent damage. I always had super long hair too!! It’s growing back fabulously. \n\nI’d suggest finding a well-rated protein treatment, possibly a scalp detox serum (they’re like exfoliants I think), and some kind of leave-in cream/conditioner.  Oiling your hair is also really good for growth - so you could look into that. \n\nI really hope you’re okay & that this gets better for you soon.

I lost probably 15 inches of beautiful, healthy, natural hair. I ended up doing a big chop and embraced wigs for about a year. Then I added in extensions until I felt more confident in my length. I'm nearly bra length again and I am finally started to feel like myself again. It's so hard when we correlate our level of beauty and attractiveness to our hair. The wonderful thing is that it grows back. I missed long hair so much, but I'm obsessed with my pictures from my bob era. It was the cutest. I know I won't have the courage to chop it again anytime soon, but you can look at the regrowth era as a chance to try new things. Wigs and extensions were annoying and expensive but were fun. I got to try cool colors that I wouldn't normally do. Looking back...I may chop an old wig into that bob again for days that I miss it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur hair can be a journey. You are stunning regardless of how it looks, just pour some love into the length you've got and relax while you regrow. Also, I swear by Olaplex's shampoo and conditioner. I shampoo and condition maybe twice per week (depends on how much I sweat). ALWAYS use heat protector if I'm straightening, tho I avoid heat where I can. Curlers when your hair is wet is the easiest way to style a bit without heat or over manipulation. Deep condition on the weekends. And looovee easy hairstyles like slick buns and French braids to give my hair breaks.  I also try-but rarely remember- to add oil to my scalp a few hours before washing. I get dry so it gives my scalp a drink. When I consistently moisturize my scalp my hair grows noticably faster. It took me about two years to get my hair from ear length to mid back.",

    "body": "There's not much on here about Adrenal PCOS, so I wanted to write down everything that has helped me/I've seen that could help someone with Adrenal PCOS.\n\nMy PCOS came at the beginning of the pandemic when the gyms closed down and I started my job, which coincided with extreme depression. I ate my feelings/sadness and started binge eating, then restricting, which led to gaining 60 lbs within a short period of time and having a fasting insulin of greater than 20 (less than 5 is the best and can be a sign of IR in remission).\n\nAfter finding this sub, I tried a bunch of different things that help with IR like Metformin, Berberine, Ovasitol, fasting, keto, etc.... And I lost exactly 0 pounds. **WHY Is that?**\n\n**All of that stressed out the body! Those work well with people with just Insulin Resistance PCOS** (which is the majority of PCOS sufferers), but cortisol is a huge issue with Adrenal PCOS.\n\nFrom what I've read, people without the best childhoods can end up getting Adrenal. My endo said it was more to do with \"The body keeping the score\" which is why stress/trauma can lead to getting sick later on. With the job I hated, I always had a high rate of stress, but it got even worse.\n\n**Exercising more did nothing.** I did strength training and walked 10K steps a day; absolutely no weight loss at all. Because of not seeing results, I would go back to binging and restricting more. As well as work stress, because I was still working in another role, but same crappy company. **Why is that?**\n\nIt goes back to higher stress levels than normal. Exercise does stress out your body, but it's a good thing normally since it can lead to muscle growth. But with doing intense strength training, my body was constantly inflamed and I looked bloated almost the entire time. And I continued to binge eat and restrict because I became ravenous and would eat everything and anything.\n\nAt this point, my IR went to 4, but I **still had not lost a single pound.** I'm pretty sure the reason was that I went from laying in bed all day to being more active.\n\nAt this point, I got a dieticin who taught me about macros. Keto never worked for me/I would lose hair when i tried that. However, adding carbs helped hair growth. The aim was to eat more protein, eat at a deficit (I'm short), and have healthy sources of fat. As well as cooking more meals versus eating out.\n\nOne thing to note: I injured my knee, so I was unable to do any exercise. Within 4 months, I lost 20 lbs. I would still binge, but with her watching my intake closely/meeting with her, my binge eating decreased and my protein increased.\n\nAfter I stopped paying for the dietician, I rapidly gained back the 20 lbs. But since I work in data, that was a great data point - exercising less and counting calories led to losing weight. And sleeping more meant less binging.\n\nAnd so I cut out strength training and switched to focusing on sleep, hitting the calorie deficit, macro split, doing yoga/pilates, and seeking a therapist. I lost the inflammation and also saw changes in my stomach and legs first, which was brand new. By doing this, I lost 60 lbs in 6 months, but I think it went that fast because I spent 2 years with an extra 60 lbs.\n\nBut because I still work at the same company, albeit changing departments, I went back to binge eating during stressful times and had a hard time getting up in the morning to go to workout. And I gained 20 lbs yet again.\n\nI read somewhere that yo-yoing is horrible for long-term health, and after speaking with a friend, it became obvious that I had been depressed for years and used binge eating to cope with everything. I started taking Wellbutrin and I lost the 20 lbs and have been maintaining it for 9+ months.\n\n**However, weight loss can make Adrenal symptoms worse**. **Why?**\n\nBecause Adrenal PCOS is the most stressful thing ever where EVERYTHING stresses out your body. Losing weight stressed out the body. And so I got hirsuitism AND hair loss.\n\nUsually with weight loss, those 2 symptoms are alleviated. At this point, I have lean PCOS.\n\nHirsuitism is the really annoying part - I've taken **Spearmint tea religiously, but all that did was get rid of jaw acne during PMS. I don't have body hair anymore, so maybe it helped with that.** However, my neck and face have EXPLODED in hair growth. I had laser initially and it cured it, but my technician told me to come back after fixing my hormones.\n\n**That leads to hormones with Adrenal.** You can take a Cortisol test, but DHEA-S from a blood test is probably best. If it's in the hundreds, that's not great, and that usually leads to hair loss and hirsuitism. Your testosterone and other hormones will probably be fine. And maddingly, high DHEA-S levels are said to be great by doctors. **With Adrenal, the most important thing is to reduce high DHEA-S for PCOS.**\n\n**But therein lies the problem - Adrenal PCOS is when your body already is stressed out compared to the baseline, and then other normal events increases it even more. So reducing high DHEA-S is difficult.**\n\nTo deal with that, there are a couple of things I've seen. Someone posted about taking Omega 3 and Vitamin E to get rid of hair problems, but the poster didn't follow-up. I take both, but never saw an improvement.\n\nHowever, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Elderberry, NAC, and magnesium have been the best so far. Why? Your body gets stressed out from getting sick/if you're deprived of Vitamin D. My DHEA-S levels dropped after taking those, and I also haven't gotten sick since taking those.\n\n**One thing that has helped hair on the head has been rosemary oil. It's the same as minoxidil, in that it blocks DHT on the scalp.** I've been taking it for a month and have been noticing increased hair growth and lots of baby hair, but not anything in the diffuse hair loss yet. But my hairline has exploded with hair growth and my hairline is growing forward instead of receding. The sides of my hair are also growing. I'm going to continue to see what happens with that, but it makes sense because DHEA-S is a precursor to DHT, which contributes to hair loss. **So Rosemary Oil with massaging the scalp blocks DHT, which is critical to use long-term because Adrenal PCOS is so delicate to balance.**\n\nOne thing I read that can potentially help is EMDR. When I was losing the 60 lbs, I did a couple of sessions, and I think that may have helped since my DHEA-S levels dropped at that point. I think that I'll look for EMDR somewhere (it's not usually covered by insurance) to see if that helps to de-stress the body.\n\nAnd one more thing - to sleep/if I have trouble sleeping/anxious about sleep/drink too much caffeine and get jittery, I'll take **Ashwaghanda** and I'm fine. However, that can increase testosterone, so that may be why I'm gaining more hair on my neck and face. I haven't found another thing that does the same thing in de-stressing/sleeping, so I'd love alternatives!\n\nHopefully this helps! Super long post, but...\n\nTLDR: everything stresses out Adrenal PCOS. Rosemary oil is helpful for hair, Ashwaghanda helpful to fall asleep. Weight loss/traditional methods that help Insulin Resistance PCOS doesn't work with Adrenal, and can sometimes make it worse.\n\nEDIT - also check your iron levels. My hair loss could also have been increased due to having low iron levels.\n\nEDIT 2 - So this post exploded, and there are all awesome questions/anecdotes/help! I got quite busy with a work deadline, so the responses/DMs will be delayed, but I will respond! ",

        "body": "Thanks so much for taking the time to write all this and go so in depth. I'm not positive that I have adrenal PCOS over the regular, but from the way you described how stressful the body gets, and how it can seem to stem from difficult childhoods, I highly suspect that I might have it. Since you mentioned how EMDR and therapy can be helpful, I just want to add on some more in terms of how important taking care of your mental health & trauma is as well.\n\nI know that I've had trauma for a long time and that it's really my body keeping the score. I'm been addressing it as much as possible. I've tried therapy and antidepressants, but none of them has worked for me. What's worked is deep introspection and inner child work that I've done on my own. Personally, doing shrooms was -remarkable- in how much it exposed me to my deepest insecurities and fears, and helping me have more empathy and compassion for myself and others overall. I've had to teach myself to stop going so fast and instead go at a slower, steadier pace, stop judging myself so much, to be more patient with myself and stop setting unrealistic expectations for myself. Basically, I've had to be a healthy parent to myself because I never really had that, and that has really helped me with my pcos symptoms, depression, adhd, c-ptsd, etc etc.\n\nMy theory has always been that it's not just enough to eat the best diet or do the best exercise or take the best vitamins, you also have to work really hard on rewiring your nervous system and subconscious from all the trauma and pain. Having deep, deep, compassion for myself and daring to face my fears and argue back against the darkest parts of myself has helped me the most and I still have so long to go but it feels really good to learn to love myself and heal my pain, as well as have energy from a better nutrition and exercise.\n\nAnyways, thanks again for your post. It really inspired me.",

Since 10/31 I have gone on to lose 25lbs with a 1200 calorie diet alone and just recently started incorporating Peloton and walking into my pretty sedentary desk job and its actually helping along with low calorie. On 10/13 when I started seeking help for my symptoms my A1C was 6 and my fasting blood sugar was 106 which indicates pre diabetes. I got tested again on 11/28 for my OBGYN and A1C was still 6 but my fasting blood sugar was 100. I started my weight loss on 10/31 after I found out I was pre diabetic. I dont do keto but I focus on eating about 90 grams of protein per day and keep my fiber high since my cholesterol is also high. My DHEA level is close to 500. I have gone through EMDR earlier this year and so I dont know thats really helped me specific to DHEA levels. My testosterone is normal and I dont really have anything more than a few chin hairs here and there. Im going on metformin and bcp Monday to see if that helps bring it down. Important thing is that everyones body will react differently, but lowering calories is key. There is no way you wont lose weight doing that since this is following the laws of energy expenditure. For anyone curious you will need to check with your GP to make sure it is safe for you, but I figured my TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) and calorie deficit from there. I do not go below 1200 since that is the least any woman should be eating for fat loss. Goal weight x .7 and that is your protein goal for the day. This will keep you full and protein burns fat.",

Also started losing weight (lean Pcos but still slightly overweight) when I cut out gluten and most sugar/alcohol. I think the adrenal - inflammation relationship is a big deal. It probably depends on the person what you’re root cause is, but I think an anti-inflammatory diet can really help with your adrenal issues.

I have stopped bleaching my hair and tried to dye it back to brown however it’s starting to lift so I have left it for now. My roots are so healthy and nice but the rest of my hair is just frizzy with so much breakage. I don’t get layers cut so the unevenness is just from breakage :/\n\nWhat products can I use to fix this?? I am currently using leave in conditioner and argan oil after I wash it and a rosemary oil mask once a week. I use hair protectant whenever i style or dry. I’m thinking of olaplex but it’s so expensive for just a few washes, would it really help and maintain results? ",

Then apply heat protectant and blowdry hair on warm NOT hot at least a foot away not right up close and follow up with a cool blast. Not everyone's hair does well with oil and it can actually make it worse for some people so you will have to experiment with that, maybe do some research. Also I'm wondering if you might actually have undercover wavy/curly hair if so that would be an entirely different routine. Sometimes people have wavy/ curly hair and they don't even know it, so they treat it as straight which causes it to look frizzy. Hair is in it's weakest state when it's wet so be gentle with it. I hope this helps🫶.

This is unfortunately beyond olaplex and masks, and at this rate I think it's time to look for shorter hairstyles to try, and to let it grow out. The ends are going to continue to split as others have said, and it's never going to smooth out. \n\nLightening is already damaging to the hair, but using color over it (demi, semi, or permanent) is only going to damage it further. Anything using peroxide will cause some amount of damage as the cuticle flares open when using developer. \n\nI also would NOT recommend the round brush dryers. They're now proving to be incredibly rough in hair, especially processed hair. A heat protector, detangling brush, and low heat dryer is truly the way to go. If you can get into it, diffusing is even better and your hair will thank you for it once it's cut. \n\nThe only thing that can potentially save the ends is k18, but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have disposable income, as it may simply not work to the degree that you would like it to. I \n\nThe good news is that shorter styles tend to help encourage wavy/curly hair to do its thing, and you may also have better luck keeping it wavy and happy while it grows with a good cut. Hair will grow back, and you'll save yourself a lot of time and heartache if you just rip the bandaid off and do it, vs trying to let it grow out and watching it continue to split.",

To be fair, I haven’t been consistent in my routine but here are the products I’ve used:\n\nMielle Rosemary Oil - This oil was what I used for my oiling routine prior to showering. I would put a couple drops on my scalp and massage that in. I would let the oil sit in my hair for 3-6 hours before washing it out with the Oaui Detox Shampoo. I only used this oil for about a year.\n\nFable & Mane Hair Oil - I started using this oil in replacement of the Mielle Rosemary Oil. I still do the same oiling routine for my pre shower hair care. I started using this in late 2024.\n\nThe Ordinary Multi Peptide Hair Serum - I started using this in late 2024 for my night time hair routine. I only put a few drops on to my scalp and hairline before I go to bed, making sure I massage it into my scalp. I only apply this when my scalp and hair are dry. \n\nKerastase Genesis Hair Serum - I also started using this in late 2024 for my night time hair routine. I’ll apply this once I get out the shower on a damp scalp. I don’t usually use the Kerastase and Ordinary serum on the same night, I like to alternate between serums. \n\nAll in all, I believe the ordinary multi peptide hair serum is what helped my baby hairs grow! Not pictured but I also have several baby hairs growing around my scalp too! \n",

I’m 25 years old and most of my doctors have proceeded to tell me it’s genetic and that there’s not much I can do. I do plan on seeing a dermatologist at some point, but all of my blood work came back fine besides my vitamin D, which I have been supplementing for the past two months as well. I have also tried rosemary oil and definitely need a thinner carrier oil due to having not only thin, but also fine straight hair. But plan to continue to do this as well\nI genuinely think it is due to my birth control that I have been taking for about 9 years, I think it has slowly hurt my hair, but I’m very fearful of going off of it and having more loss, so I am waiting to see my gyno before doing so. \nKeep in mind I don’t really have a bunch of shedding and have not noticed shedding over the years either\nTonight I was stressing about my hair once again and decide to look at my past photos and videos and was shocked to see the difference in my hair, I have died it darker since, but am beginning to have hope that this is actually working!!!\nPicture 1: 8/23/23\nPicture 2: 9/14/2023\nPicture 3: 9/20:2023\nPicture 4+5+6+7: 10/5/2023\nPicture 8+9: 11/24/2023\nPicture 10: 1/2/2024\nPicture 11+12+13: 1/30/2024",

    "body": "Hello, I am seriously sad right now 😂 I box dyed my hair dark brown every 2-3 months all over for a year and a half. Every time I visited my family they’d tell me it looked horrible and disgusting and kept saying I should go blonde. I kind of started to dislike it, and thought maybe I wasn’t seeing something everyone else was. Soooo I went to my first appointment, a well known salon, but the girl made it red/orange. It was so bad and I hated it. She said she couldn’t fix it and so she put a semi-permenant dark brown dye back on top and left it (because I had a graduation event coming up). This was in March. And then at the end of August I went to a new stylist (not the previous girls fault, I just moved home from uni), since then I have had 4 appointments and it is blonde, but also has a lot of orange / warmth in the front section for some reason. My main concern is the breakage. A picture of my hair before I did all of this came up in my memories and now I seriously hate myself 😭😭 pls help me. I am supposed to have one more bleach appointment with this stylist as Im going travelling in February.\n\nI’ve tried putting in extensions. The warmth of my hair right now doesn’t really match, but once curled its fine. I just still don’t really like it… am I being dramatic or is the colour ok? I asked for a creamy blonde but I was aware it wasn’t going to reach that stage as I box dyed it.\n\nMy main question is, does anyone have any recommendations at all for how I could make my hair healthier and also look better? Should I ask for something different at the salon? My natural hair colour is a mousey brown. I have been using pureology shampoo and conditioner the last 3 weeks, incorporated K18 into my routine and I also use argon oil. I also add rosemary oil to my scalp and massage it once a week and I sleep with my hair in a plait every night. \n\nBoth of the pics above are after washing, blow drying and adding oil to the hair.\n\nHELP. Thx x",

Just tone it down a little bit so it is one process, cut it and let it rest.   I love a rooted look, so just let it grow and gradually go darker  if that is the goal.   You have lots of options for a toner, you just need to decide what you want it to be.  I think a cooler tone could be nice, but warm can be nice too in the right circumstance.  Thats the most important decision to make first i think.   Then the stylist can go from there.   Its hard to say too much more as you are not in my chair,  just go somewhere you trust with one or two pics for reference.    The good news is lightening is the hard part, but light or dark just decide where you want to go with it in the future and that will inform where you go next.  Good luck!   You should post pics😉",

        "body": "Master hairstylist here.. To start I am sorry to hear that your  family made you feel self conscious about your dark hair it looks beautiful if the first picture and the one I saw in the comments.. Long read I apologize.\n\nYour hair is stressed and unfortunately damaged which is obvious from the pictures. It is remarkable to me that the stylist was able to achieve this level of blonde with the many layers of dark brown that have been applied over the years.\n\nIt needs a significant cut, ideally to a bob length below the collar bone at the longest in my professional opinion. I would try to not use flat irons or curling irons as much as possible, an alternative is the dyson air wrap as you can achieve waves without as much heat damage but again an investment.\n\nK18 is awesome I would continue to use that as recommended by a trusted stylist. But I would be careful with olaplex it can do more harm than good.  You also don't want to overload your hair with too many products, it is too much of a good thing. Heat protection and smoothing are your best friends. I love aveda, oribe, or davines product lines the most. They are pricey but they will actually help your hair feel and look better. \n\nNow for the color, you have already invested in getting it this light. Unfortunately through the lightening process the integrity of your hair has been sacrificed and you likely have very little cuticle layer left which is what keeps the color inside the hairshaft. If you want to go back brunette it will need to be filled before applying the dark otherwise you risk having it turn swampy aka green. On top of that it will fade quickly and will require another coat in 4-6 weeks. I would only feel safe using a semi maybe a demi permanent color on it as they are less harsh and help to close the cuticle. But it be flat and lack luster for a while because of the damage, no matter what product you use. It has to grow and be cut off.\n\nHave you thought of a shadow root with some balayage low light to anchor the color and add depth and then tone the ends to a slighty darker neutral blonde? This will give you the best of both worlds imo. It will give you back the darker root that looks amazing on you while utilizing the blonde that you paid dearly for. It also looks amazing with bobs. This technique is expensive but it will grow out well and allow your hair to rest, grow and heal. For a future appointment it will just be roots and a toner. \n\nFinally do some research and asked trusted people for stylist recommendations, even strangers hair that you love. You are looking for a blonde specialist who has several years of experience. I would look at their social media to ensure that you like their technique. And put your trust in them. It's unfortunately not going to be perfect but it will look a million times better and then you can start growing it again.\n\n Please try not to allow other people's opinions to make you change. And trust a stylist when they say your hair can't handle something, they most likely aren't lying if they are a reputable stylist. I can't figure out how to add a link so I will post a few color ideas in another comment. Best of luck, may the hair gods be in your favor.",

I’m thinking of dyeing my ends, but I’m not sure if I should wait until they’re more matured or what factors matter. (Context) I have high porosity hair and mist with water and rosemary oil/ coconut oil every other day (transparency I do forget sometimes and go 2/3 days without misting 😬). \n\nAny suggestions on what to avoid or start doing to either prepare my hair for dye/ bleach or post dye care? Or just based on what I said anything I can do better currently to help my locs. PLEASE IM NEW TO THIS AND NEED HELP! lol ",

For bleaching the tips the only recommendation I can give is to make sure your bleach is thinner than a creamy thickness. I think you can add a tiny bit of water to the mixture to thin it out a lil BUT you wanna do this so that the bleach reaches the inner parts of your loc. I ended up doing mine in two sessions at home but I had to make sure my bleach wasn't too thick the second time cause it didn't get through to some parts and was still dark after the first time.",

She did an amazing (to me) takedown of why rosemary oil for hair growth is essentially snake oil.\n\n[Rosemary oil for hair growth? How to spot bad science ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q)(YouTube)\n\n[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=0s) What is rosemary oil meant to do?  \n[1:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=81s) How peer review works  \n[5:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=342s) Never trust the abstract  \n[7:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=454s) The abstract  \n[8:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=535s) The actual paper  \n[9:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=585s) Dermatology problems  \n[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=695s) A whole flood of problems  \n[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=920s) The \"significant\" results  \n[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=1049s) Why people might think it \"works\"  \n[19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=1171s) My conclusions vs \"peer reviewed\" conclusions  \n[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=1213s) What about other evidence? Mechanistic reasoning  \n[23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=1396s) Can it work like finasteride? (5-alpha reductase inhibitor) (No)  \n[25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2NCv_vF2Q&t=1504s) Is rosemary oil worth trying? How to use it and what to try instead\n\nAlternatively, here's her [blog post with the info written out](https://labmuffin.com/does-rosemary-oil-work-for-hair-growth-the-science/).\n\n  \nIn summary: **it was a bad paper based on bad science from unreliable authors**. Bad methodology (imagine ignoring natural fluctuations of hair growth in a hair growth study) from untrustworthy authors (they have at least 13 retracted papers between them) and rife with typos that purport unbelievable results (as in, the *exact same* *mean & standard deviation* of hair count at the start of the trial and at 3 months in the groups studied).\n\nAnd, according to Wong/Lab Muffin, **\"The average difference for rosemary oil and minoxidil after 6 months is 6 and 2 hairs respectively**, in groups where the standard deviation is up to around 50.\" WHAT. THAT IS SO FEW HAIRS FOR THAT STD.\n\n\n\nTo me, what this shows is that it's difficult to \"do your own research\" because it takes genuine effort and education to discern good from bad research. Wong makes the very good point that almost nobody who sees the headlines reads the academic paper, and if they do, 99.9999% only read the abstract—including the trichologists/dermatologists/influencers/TikTokers/whoever else on the rosemary oil train.\n\nJust wanted to share so that we don't pour our hope and $$$ into too-good-to-be-true products that sadly just don't work. It is wild that there's such pressure to publish that researchers don't feel bad releasing shit-quality papers that gain so much traction basically unchecked.\n\n\\~Sending hair growth vibes to all!\\~ Except to study authors Panahi, Taghizadeh, Tahmasbpour Marzony, and Sahebkar, who do not deserve it.

I’d say research different creams/meds and go visit a doctor to discuss it!",

    "body": "In August 2021 I had just started a new job and a week later I was thrown into another total Covid lockdown (australia). I had been dating a man for 3 months and it wasn’t working, so I ended it. And most frustratingly, no matter what I tried, my scalp was always flaking, itching, burning, and even bleeding. \n\nI went to Aldi on my lunch break one day, one of the few places that was allowed to open, and they were selling men’s clippers. ‘Fuck it’ I thought, ‘who knows how long this lock down will last?’ I’d tried everything from Head & Shoulders, Tea Tree Oil Shampoo, Tar Shampoo, even Nizoral 2%. So I shaved it all off. \n\nI used Aveeno generously on my scalp once my hair was gone to get it healthy again. As my hair grew I used Nizoral 2% consistently which kept my scalp healthy, but damaged my hair a bit. I used Coco & Eve like a virgin masque as conditioner every wash, and their miracle elixir which helped a bit. \n\nEarlier this year I started using L’Oréal Dream Lengths shampoo and conditioner. Recently my scalp has been a bit inflamed and flaky again so I’m doing some damage control with Nizoral, it makes my hair awfully greasy though. I think moving forward I’ll keep using Dream Lengths and do a few washes with Nizoral whenever my scalp flares up. \n\nIn between washes I have been using rosemary water some evenings with a scalp massage (fresh rosemary boiled in water for 15 min in a spray bottle), Mielle rosemary oil on my scalp the night before I wash, L’Oréal Elvive Extraordinary Oil Jojoba daily, I dust my hair frequently and am very gentle with brushing, I did a couple of applications of K18, I sleep with a satin night cap 95% of the time (I don’t wash them frequently enough though which could be contributing to my scalp issues), I hardly ever use heat tools (I did a blow dry on warm before the last photo because I’m going out tonight), and I’ve stopped using scrunchies completely — I only use claw clips and hair pins. I also used a 0.3mm derma roller on my scalp once a week for about 6 weeks, but stopped because I wasn’t seeing any change and didn’t want to damage my scalp. \n\nMy hair has always been a big part of my identity, and more often than not, a visible warning as to my mental state. I’ve bleached, dyed, chemically straightened, cut bangs both from professionals and at home, but shaving is the last thing I hope to ever do to negatively impact my hair health. Well, except for smoking the occasional cigarette and frequent weed. \n\nI looked fugly with shaved, short, pixie length hair, but I don’t regret it. It was something I’d always thought about, and at the time it was something I needed to do. And now my hair and scalp are fairly healthy and I’m learning how to keep it that way ❤️",

I had tried all the natural remedies there were - onion juice, Rosemary oil, Waterman’s shampoo and elixir, Vegamour serum, multiple Ayurvedic treatments, thin Lizzy hair loss elixir, Ordinary multi peptide serum, various supplements.\nI had reached breaking point. My hair loss seemed to be getting worse and worse, and I was only 25. I took the plunge, very reluctantly, but it has been a miracle. It has nearly been a year and I continue to see progress each month. I know minoxidil doesn’t work for everyone, but if I hadn’t come across this page, I don’t think I would have ever tried it. So thank you to those who posted their progress pics, and I hope I can encourage someone else.",

I think there was a shedding phase after 2-3 months, but it was not that bad.\n\nHairline has seen some slight improvement. I think ? Crown area has improved but is by far the most bare, even after 8 months.\n\nThis was an experiment and was documented on a weekly basis.\n\nI looked into finastride and minoxidil but the reported side effects and cost dissuaded me from going that route.\n\nDermarolling is most likely the biggest contributor here. The Saw Palmetto capsule is possibly acting as a mild DHT blocker and the biotin is just to promote stronger hair.\n\nThoughts ?",

I try to be as compassionate and encouraging as possible but it does get to me, too..there is no alternative that has as much clinical evidence of efficacy as minoxidil and androgen/dht blockers. if you want to stop losing hair you have to buck up and treat your hair loss with these medically proven treatment options. what’s worse? possible side effects (you can stop the meds at any time), not getting results (prob not gonna happen and you’re not worse off than when you started) or continuing to lose hair? aga is chronic and progressive. it needs to be managed with real clinically backed medical interventions. this is not the time for snake oils and alternative treatments if you want to see improvement.",

But if you care and want things to get better you can’t linger in denial for too long.  \n\nI sometimes get very frustrated by the gaslighting that goes on when people post photos of their early stage hair loss.  There are a lot of folks who are looking for help and get told they’re imagining it or shouldn’t worry.  It’s disheartening to see people try and push people into denying the existence of their hair loss.  Catching it early is key.  Then I see posts about people getting triggered by early stage hair loss and I’m even more sad for this community.  This isn’t a competition on who has it worse.  I think it’s important to help people get help from a derm early on, no matter what the hell stage I’m in.  It’s the mentality of “you’re crazy for thinking your hair loss matters because I’m in advanced stages.”  What’s wrong with treating early?  Or is this projection?  IF you failed to treat your own hair loss early on then help others learn from your mistakes!  Don’t downplay people in early or middle stages.  \n\nWish more support was extended to others here instead of pushing people into denial or pointless treatments.  Sometimes I enjoy r/tressless for its ruthless honesty lol.",

A journey that has taken even longer because I got BOTCHED wolf cut layers that ended up complicating my grow-out so much more. First pic is sometime between mid to end of 2022, second pic is recently. I'm just really glad that I'm finally reaching a point with my hair that I can feel good about, for the majority of my life l've battled with my hair and its texture and l've always hated it (part of why I had a pixie cut for a while). I had a pixie cut for most of highschool and grew it out a little while after I graduated (I'm 23).\n\nIf anyone's wondering, I used to use Mielle rosemary & mint shampoo & conditioner, but I switched to Redken's All Soft line because I really like the shine ig gives my hair. I try and do scalp oilings with Mielle's rosemary oil, and have for the past couple years, but l've been slacking recently.\n\nI ALSO regularly do hair masks, olaplex treatments, and oil the ends frequently. I have been back and forth between. olaplex's oil and Redken's all soft oil. Tbh I'm still iffy on the redken oil, I'm still new to using it but it feels much more like a silicone silk treatment than like an oil. might go back to olaplex oil, but we'll see.\n\nI also used Kristen Ess's heatless curler for these curls, I try not to use heat on my hair but when I do it's a simple blow dryer brush. The kristen ess curler works alot better than cheaper foam heatless curlers because it's a softer foam, WAYYY easier to sleep in too, 10/10 would recommend\n\nI also do kristen ess hair gloss treatments for dark neutral brown hair. My natural color is the shade of brown that's ALMOST black but not quite, but the sun over time has been lightening and reddening the lengths of my hair, so the gloss has helped color correct back to my natural color.\n\nThe pic has no filters on it, this is just the shine from the camera light and shininess is really hard to achieve with my hair texture so l've been super stoked that it's even been possible to get shine at ALL lol.\nI could yap all day about products I use, feel free to ask any questions. Also feel free to offer any suggestions on improvements, I know my hair still has a lot of work to be done ",

I really strongly believe it is due to this routine so I’d like to share if it helps anyone. \n\nMy oiling routine tends to look like this:\n\n1.\t⁠Stimulate scalp for 3 minutes with bamboo brush or any brush. You’ll feel you scalp get stimulated to know it’s working.\n2.\t⁠Apply rosemary oil to scalp every 1/2 inch or so. Part your hair to apply to scalp evenly. I usually just run the dropper down my scalp in the back as rosemary oil is known to kiss bacteria and I’ve never had any issues with infection.\n3.\t⁠Massage with your hands or scalp massager for 3 minutes again. Make sure you don’t rub the skin you need to move the skin around.\n4.\t⁠Put oil in your mids and ends. Any hydrating oil will work. I’ve been using olive oil recently but you can also get coconut oil, Argan oil, or jojoba oil. It’s all about preference.\n5.\t⁠Leave in for up to 4 hours. It’s not good to leave in overnight as it can clogs. Usually I’ll but my hair in a loose bun or Dutch braid as those styles keep your hair out of your face and can hide the look of an oily scalp.\n6.\t⁠Wash hair. I usually wash my scalp twice to entire I’ve removed all of the oil. Be sure to only shampoo your roots and then apply conditioner to mids and ends.\n\nIMPORTANT: You only need to mix with a carrier oil if it is an essential oil. DO NOT PUT ESSENTIAL OIL ON YOUR SCALP lol. I would suppose high porosity hair would like a thinner oil and low porosity would like a thicker one. It’s really all about what makes your hair feel the best to you. your hair is extremely fragile when you put an oil mask in; similar to when your hair is wet. Make sure what every style you put your hair in has NO TESION on the scalp. Also please NEVER brush your hair while the mask is in. Be sure to detangle before applying.",

Decided to make a reddit account just to share some hope incase anyone else is struggling.\n\nIn January 2024 I developed a gold ball sized cyst and had to go to the ER. I was put on antibiotics, steroids, and 50mg of Spironolactone. I had the cyst biopsied and was diagnosed with Acne Fulminans. \nLooking back the diagnosis made sense as I had been sick, dealing with extreme weight loss and joint pain. I would get hormonal acne around my period but it was never this bad. I still have a theory that it was tied to my IUD “expiring” and the stress of getting out of a 6 year long relationship. \n\nbut i digress, treatment plan for anyone interested:\n\nI was on prednisone for 3.5 months before starting accutane - the dosage varied but the swelling in my face showed. Since it was getting progressively worse my dermatologist decided to start me on 30mg - 60mg of isotretinoin the first month(switched dose every day to ease into it) and then up to 90mg by the third month. (i’m only 115lbs for reference) \n\nAround month 5 I started experiencing hair loss, it was coming out in huge clumps. My acne was still pretty bad so my dermatologist and I decided to continue treatment, but lower my dose back down to 30mg/60mg and then completely down to 30mg daily around month 10. \n\nMy hair loss subsided when the dosage was lowered, & my hair is growing back with weekly castor and rosemary oil treatments so I’m glad I didn’t decide to completely shave my head. \n\nI’ve received treatment for my scars but they’re still pretty bad. The cysts that my derm gave cortisone shots did unfortunately atrophy, so any advice on remedying scarring would be greatly appreciated\n",

        "body": "Hello!! I am a 20 year old female and was diagnosed with AGA about a year and a half ago in August of 2020. I have been updating this group of my progress and I thought I’d update one last time. When I was first diagnosed at such a young age, seeing success stories with tips on where to start always helped me and gave me hope to continue on. I hope this post helps those of you who are feeling helpless and lost right now. \n\nCommon questions I get:\n\n-How can I tell if I have AGA (androgenic alopecia, chronic) vs TE (telogen effluvium, usually short term)?\nI personally recommend asking your dermatologist for a scalp biopsy as that’s the most sure way of finding out what type of hair loss you have. I know some women have had issues with doctors refusing to do biopsy’s but I recommend that you look for a provider who is willing to perform one for you. \n\n-How much or how long did I shed when I first started minoxidil/Rogaine?\nI shed for about 3-6 weeks when I first began using minox. I started shedding on my 3rd week and after about 6 weeks I noticed it slowing down significantly. I found that during this period I’d lose a combination of short thin hairs and long terminal hairs (about 75-150 hairs a day). \n\n-Do I experience any side effects from minox (itchy/irritated scalp, wrinkles, greasy hair, etc.)?\nWhen I first began, it definitely made my scalp itchy but after about two weeks the itchiness went away. There were times where my scalp was sore or tender but after a few weeks that also went away. My derm explained that the soreness was probably from all of the hairs falling. I haven’t noticed any pre mature aging and the foam does not make my hair greasy and actually makes it more voluminous. \n\n-Is there any weird hair growth or does minox help you grow normal hairs?\nThis is hard to tell because I can’t track each new/growing hair but I noticed that at first thinner hairs would be growing in. Now it seems more of the new hairs are the regular thickness. \n\n-Which treatment do you think makes the biggest difference?\nThis is also hard for me to tell as I started most of my treatments all at once but I think spiro helped manage my testosterone levels the best and minoxidil helped grow new hairs the best. The rest are just aiding to help my hair grow faster or feel healthier. \n\n-Do you plan to take minox forever? How did you work it into your routine?\nYes. I do plan on continuing these treatments for the rest of my life or at least for as long as I can as stopping them will result in all of my progress being lost. Although this idea was initially very daunting for me as a young 20 year old but now that I’ve worked it into my routine, I compare it to brushing my teeth or moisturizing which I do every day. I do think this is a big commitment so I think those who are starting out should decide whether they want to commit to it or not before starting minoxidil. \n\n-What will you do when you have to stop all of these treatments to have kids?\nBecause these medications can cause issues when conceiving a child, I will have to stop the treatments while I try for kids. Honestly the thought of this still scares me as I am scared to lose my progress. But I have seen stories of women who are on the treatments for years before they stop to have kids and once they are done having kids they restart the treatments and regain their progress once again. \n\n-Do I get any side effects from the high dose of spiro or BC?\nAt first I used to get lightheaded when is good up too fast but now that doesn’t happen anymore. I do find that I urinate a lot more often though due to spiro. I also found that my skin improved significantly and I no longer have any acne. On BC I did have some mood swings but I think they are gone now. I lost a lot of weight on these medications as well (about 20lb). \n\n-What shampoo do you use? How do you mix it?\nI mix about a two quarter sized globs of 2% Ketoconazole shampoo with equal parts Costco moisturizing shampoo and 3-5 drops of rosemary oil in my hand everytime I was my hair. I like to wash my hair every other day at my dermatologist’s recommendation so that DHT and other oils don’t build up too much in my hair follicles. \n\n-Does nutrafol really work? Is it worth it?\nI do think nutrafol helps my hair feel healthier and softer but I am unsure if I am going to continue using it for two reasons. One is that it is pretty costly for a vitamin. And second, the pills taste horrible to me, like sawdust. \n\n-Do you still shed?\nYes I still find myself shedding a normal amount (about 50/day, a little more on shower days) short thin hairs as well as normal long hairs. My dermatologist said that it was normal and that doing these treatments won’t prevent people from losing hair completely. It is also normal to go through periods of increased shedding and it can fluctuate sometimes. But over all my hair loss has mostly settled down. \n\nI hope this helped but if anyone has any other questions please feel free to ask them! These are answered based on my personal experience and it may differ from person to person depending on how one reacts to the treatments so please consult your doctors for any serious questions. \n\nThis hair loss journey was/is an extremely challenging one for me and my mental health. I used to hate the feel of wind blowing through my hair as it made me feel so aware of my hair loss. I would tie my hair up so I wouldn’t feel the little fallen strands trailing down my back. I had to have my mother brush my hair after I showered because I hated seeing how much would come out. I refused to let anyone get near my hair and would avoid going out/skip social events on days where it looked bad. I sat at night crying for months about how unfair this all was and anxiously worrying about the future. Even though my hair loss has evened out there are still days when I struggle with it mentally and I know there are so many people out there who feel the same so please let me know if there’s anything I can do to support you or answer your questions.",

To keep the beautiful colour I roast the beetroots whole, either wrapped individually in foil or covered in foil in a small pan. Once they're done, a knife will go through - they won't feel soft but they'll be the same texture all the way through. Let them cool a bit and then rub them with a paper towel to peel them, the skin will slip right off. You could then blend them up with some pasta water, infused oil, salt, maybe some garlic. I have a lot of rosemary in the freezer so I'm going to try this next time I make a beetroot sauce! \n\nThe recipe I make doesn't look as smooth and glossy as yours which makes me think the sauce might be passed through a fine mesh sieve and/or emulsified with butter.

Depending on the shape you're making, you might need some eggs and regular flour to make it work.  \n\nIt's been about 10 years and IIRC,  I had to make some adjustments to get the right flavor and consistency, but its pretty easy to add more, so I'd go on the conservative side at first.  \n\nRosemary is a pretty strong flavor, so there are plenty of ways to get it in the final dish.  You can add it to the dough, but its probably better to put it in the sauce.  \n\n\nIf you want to try some other colors, squid ink makes a black pasta that is really neat, and you can make a cool green dye pureeing spinach.",

Switched to dut, and in 30 days saw SIGNIFICANT results and regrowth. Hair was getting thicker and looked healthier and not straw like anymore. I must add that I also incorporated leave in conditioner and a hair powder drink to nourish the new hairs. I also changed my shampoo to rosemary oil infused because it strengthens hair so you don’t lose the new baby hairs from breakage. I’m now 2+ months in dut + hair nourishing and my god the bald spot is gone. Still thin and needs to shed/grow for a year or so but I think I cracked the code. I know genetics play a big role, but this has been working and I’m excited about the near future. I just recently stopped wearing hats and thats an amazing feeling. I’ll list the items and where I get most of them. \n\n1. Dutasteride 0.5mg daily (Don’t ask me where) \n2. TGIN leave in conditioner (Walmart)\n3. Mielle rosemary shampoo (Walmart) \n4. Multi collagen peptides by codeage (Amazon) has large amounts of Biotin and Keratin and tastes like…burnt hair. Mix it with Bloom, protein, or literally any powder that has flavor. Koolaid. Idc. Something. \n\nAs you can see my daily 4 items above, I stopped taking oral fin, oral min, and topical min. All I do is pop a dut pill and take care of my regrowth with nourishments. And I’m still seeing improved results every week. It’s actually insane and all my coworkers are astonished. I hope this regimen works for you. I hope you can get your hair back or at least some regrowth brothers. DUT FTW. \n\nFor hormone therapy users: Want to add, if you are on high dose TRT or other hormone stuff, FIN and DUT blocks the conversion of DHT so you actually will have higher test levels which aromatize into even more estrogen. So keep that in mind. ",

I've had a really stressful couple months with my father passing and selling my house and moving, and unfortunately my hairline has suffered for it. \n\nI wanted to use Rogaine until I read that it's not good for small pets so I took to tiktok to understand other options and rosemary water was recommended for hair health but I wondered if it would help my hair grow. \n\nAfter a month I'm pleasantly surprised of the progress I've made and I wanted to share it with everyone. Please note both of these photos are taken after a shower and I use the same styling method both times.\n\nI've also been using rosemary oil on my balding spots 2 hours before a shower. \n\nTo make the rosemary water, boil water and take it off the heat and let a bunch of fresh rosemary steep in it overnight. It's good for 2 weeks IN THE FRIDGE.I froze the other half of what I made and then took it out after 2 weeks so one batch made a month supply. I applied it before bed every night. I can post an Amazon link to the type of application method I use but you could just spray it on or dab it on. I really like this method because I feel like it also prevents my hair from getting greasy super fast too and it also gives it volume the next day so I was only washing once every 4 days. I will report back after another couple months! ",

That's how strongly it ties in.\n\n# Context:\n\n* moon's dying and everyone knows it because of what happened in Traitor's Moon (March 2022)\n* many hunters put their faith in Mr Chary to fix it as a last-ditch hope\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Scene One: Ascension Church (Chap 1-4)\n\n* Mr Chary draws some kind of dark magic sigil in the mud, Kevin Linus \\[False Saint\\] watches from his house\n* Mary Ochenkov \\[Ochenkov's Widow\\] walked straight in and burst into flames, \\[False Saint\\] shared the pain despite being outside the circle\n* \\[Ochenkov's Widow\\] tries to break down \\[False Saint\\]'s front door bare-handed, while on fire, screaming \"WHY DIDN'T YOU HELP ME\" as her fingers bleed\n* It was \\[False Saint\\]'s dream oooOOoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* \\[False Saint\\] is trying to track down Mr Chary\n* He's noticing more snakes are appearing\n* Chary is sending assassins, but the moon has given him an \"otherworldly intuition\"\n* Finally pins Chary in Ascension Parish\n* Chary's snipers blow him apart\n* Chary does some shit-talking\n* The hole in \\[False Saint\\]'s chest starts growing a brood of small white snakes\n* For two hours, the snakes keep coming while Mr Chary is ripping them out and letting them bite him\n* At the end, they put the biggest snake in a bag, which bites one of Chary's men, he dies instantly\n* Mr Chary goes to shoot \\[False Saint\\] in the head, but \\[False Saint\\] bites into his wrist\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Scene Two: Under Kingsnake Mine (5-6)\n\n* Deep under Kingsnake mine, Isaac Powel \\[The Night Seer\\] watches Ira Ozols \\[The Prescient\\] weaving a basket of flesh and rosemary oil (note: this is similar to the demon-catching rope described by the Pax)\n* The Viper is just vibing in the corner\n* Mr Chary arrives and approves of the basket, introduces \\[Night Seer\\] and The Viper\n* Mr Chary tells \\[Night Seer\\] to \"show some respect\" to The Viper (\" I believe they would rather not be addressed as he \")\n* The Viper was sent by a group called \"The Sinners\" to \"Fit the task\"\n* The Viper says the snake's name is Delara\n* Chary is very pro The Sinners and The Hunters of The Night to co-operate, but \\[Night Seer\\] is unsure Finch \\[[An AHA higher-up](https://huntshowdown.fandom.com/wiki/From_the_Journals_of_Elwood_Finch)\\] would agree\n* Chary implies he's going to back-stab Finch, and shows off a \"new breed\" of snake with \"exquisite venom\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* \\[The Prescient\\] keeps weaving to distract herself from what Chary might make her do\n* \\[The Night Accolite\\] is annoyed \\[The Night Seer\\] keeps giving tasks to \\[The Precient\\] over her\n* \\[The Precient\\] is left alone with Mr Chary (note: it refers to her as \"The Night Follower\" at one point)\n* She confirms to Chary that she shares \\[The Night Seer\\]'s vision, but feels as though he's not telling the full story\n* Chary says he has a way to let her find out the full picture, and she follows immediately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Scene Three: The Bayou (Chap 7-10)\n\n* Mary Burgess \\[Hail Mary\\] and Circe Elias \\[The Witch Hunter\\] are hunting together under the direction of Mr Chary\n* \"\\[Hail Mary\\] was easy to convince: The Bayou was full of sin, and Mr Chary was a servant of the Lord\"\n* \\[The Witch Hunter\\] was convinced using a locket with a portrait of her family in it\n* They find a collapsed shack with a heavily injured person inside\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Two snakes are still embedded in \\[False Saint\\]'s side which now protect him in the Bayou\n* Enjoying some PSTD of Chary ripping them out\n* In a prison shack Chary left him in\n* When the full moon rose, he found the strength to push open the door\n* It falls off its hinges, surprising \\[The Witch Hunter\\] and \\[Hail Mary\\] \"lurking outside\"\n* Pistol standoff, \\[Hail Mary\\] accuses him of being Satan\n* The Viper appears behind him, and allows Delara to bite their own hand\n* GUNFIGHT STARTS\n* Viper gets some kind of boost from the venom, but it's not enough to contend with \\[False Saint\\]'s moon power\n* \\[The Witch Hunter\\] and \\[Hail Mary\\] are kept busy by near-endless snakes\n* \\[False Saint\\] shoots a killing shot at \\[The Viper\\], but Delara takes the bullet to protect them\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* \\[False Saint\\] escapes\n* \\[The Witch Hunter\\] and \\[Hail Mary\\] try to heal Delara and give chase, \\[The Viper\\] stays behind\n* A snake from the attack approaches them\n* They feed it to Delara, and shoves the venom fangs into their own neck\n* The venom gives them a hallucination of the shit Chary's put \\[False Saint\\], \\[Ochenkov's Widow\\] and everyone else through\n* They realise they need to stop Chary\n* Their puts a basket on their face (so he's now the Rise version of his skin)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Scene Four: The Vision (Chapter 11)\n\n* \\[The Precient\\] has done the ritual and can now see magic shit, and is preparing to see \\[The Night Seer\\]'s vision\n* Blindfold yourself, step into a tub of (mud & black dye?) and cut your clothes with a razor, letting the pieces of cloth fall in\n* \"The truth of the Night Seer's vision was monstrous\", other terrible things\n* She is beginning to see into the future\n* Mr Chary tells \\[The Night Seer\\] about her betrayal. He Hunts her down. He kills her\n* As she sees more, she starts to cut herself, blood pouring into the water\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Scene Five: Betrayal (Chapters 12-15)\n\n* \\[False Saint\\] is hiding in a bush after \\[The Viper\\]'s screams gave him a PTSD-induced panic attack over \\[Ochenkov's Widow\\]\n* The moon is too sick to comfort him\n* \\[The Witch Hunter\\], \\[Hail Mary\\] and \\[The Viper\\] find him\n* He explains that he has never killed anyone, and Chary is trying to poison the moon\n* The three agree that Chary was probably lying to them, and they should interrogate him\n* They begin to return to Kingsnake, with \\[False Saint\\] in tow\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As they approach, they hear gunfire\n* They hear \\[The Precient\\] shouting \"Enter now and witness the end of the Night Seer, or go your own way\"\n* They enter anyway\n* They find \\[The Precient\\] and \\[The Night Seer\\] in a standoff\n* \\[The Precient\\] explains the vision will lead only to corruption, \\[The Night Seer\\] accuses her of being a false seer\n* Chary calls out from deeper in the cave\n* \\[The Precient\\] can't properly focus her visions on \\[False Saint\\], Mr Chary, or some mysterious, rageful creature at the bottom of the mine\n* \\[The Night Seer\\] shoots \\[False Saint\\] in the head\n* \\[The Night Seer\\] and Mr Chary run out as dynamite goes off, collapsing the mine, trapping the five\n* \\[False Saint\\] takes a minute but survives because let's not forget he survived worse in scene one\n* The other hunters are wildly confused\n* \\[Hail Mary\\] says the words 'among us' (the rest of the sentence isn't important)\n* \\[The Precient\\] can feel the mysterious angry thing from earlier approaching\n* \" He’d heard that scream of anguish countless times in his nightmares. \\[...\\] 'She’s here.' He couldn’t say more.\"\n\n# A few footnotes\n\n* You may think Kingsnake mine is too shallow to host all this, but remember, the cave-in has already happened. As you walk in from the big southeast entrance and continue straight, you're quickly met with a collapsed mineshaft. All the Kingsnake events happened past this barrier. There's also an entrance barricaded with iron at the north of the compound, and an elevator shaft that extends much further down.\n* Snakeshot, the sparks pistol skin, is in memorial of Delara, and has her skin on it. It's not stated when she actually dies, as she's alive during the final chapter. Large captive snakes live up to 16 years.\n* The contents of Snake Oil Ward, the antidote shot skin, is made from Delara's venom\n* The dynamite used to seal Kingsnake mine was specifically Red Dog, likely triggered by Miner's Song, the alert trip mine.\n* During the first fight:\n   * Hail Mary was using Lucidus, the silenced Vetterli skin\n   * The Viper used Slither, the Winfield swift skin\n   * False Saint/Kevin used Antosha, the Caldwell Chain skin\n* There's never any reference to the Witch Hunter's ~~or the Prescient's~~ weapons, so we can assume they used the weapons from their respective DLCs\n   * During the Kingsnake events, The Prescient was likely using Talisman, the new Krag skin\n* I will edit this post every time I notice bad spelling or a misleading summary",

ANYWAYS i decided to give it a shot bc whats the harm in scalp massages? even if i didnt see growth, they are really relaxing 💆🏾‍♀️  she claims that the results wouldn't be seen until past the first month and done on a consistent basis so i didnt expect to see any difference month 1.\nso far ive been doing the massages for almost a month. i started around feb 6th. the first pic was feb 12th and the second pic was march 1st. i normally gain 1/2 inch a month. \n\nthe first pic my hair was around 3/4 inch so i expected by the end of the month it would be around 1 inch. however in the second pic it's past the 1.25 inch mark!!\n\nWHAT I DID:  in the beginning i was a lot better at doing 2 hours worth of scalp massages, but the past two weeks its been more like 90 minutes. i have an electronic massager & i would massage my scalp OVER the bonnet with my hair in abt 6-8 plaits. the massager auto stops after 10 minutes so i would do an area for 10 minutes 2x a day. sometimes i would sit for prolonged periods (while doom scrolling or watching tv) but i usually broke it up throughout the day!! \nalso, i think its important to note that i added rosemary oil & more consistent with my multivitamin intake in these past 2 weeks as well which may have helped the boost! \ni know ppl are skeptical abt it but i think she has some tea!! i have NEVERRR gotten above a 1/2 inch in a month  and i oiled & massaged my scalp atleast 2-4x/week for 5-10 minutes before i joined her experiment. \n\ni will come back and update my progress at the end of march !!! very excited abt what i'm seeing so far",

Straightening, stress & depression thinned it & corona gave me hair fall in the range of almost 300-400 strands a day. My scalp was visible and hair was extremely fragile. For first few months after corona I tried lot of home remedies to stop hair fall and nothing worked (curd+lemon/curry leaf paste/curry leaf oil/hibiscus mask/onion oil etc)\n\nFinally visited a doctor in April 2021 and was diagnosed with TE. He prescribed me vitD, a hair vitamin & hair spray. After taking the medicines regularly for 8 months till November, my hair fall was in the range of 200 strands a day, no baby hair and fragile hair as before. 8 months was long enough to see changes but there wasn't any change.\n\nI was so sad at the state of my hair that I gave up on medicines and went back to try home remedies & make some slight but consistent lifestyle changes.\nNow 11 months later my hair is no more fragile, around 4-5 inch long new hair growth & lots n lots of baby hair. I don't have the thick hair I had in my mid 20s but it's much thicker from the time severe hair fall started.\n\nFYI: I am not sure which of the following things worked for me, so I am listing everything I did in last 11 months which I didn't do prior to that.\n\nThe changes I incorporated from 29th November 2021 was as follows\n\n1. 4.2 l water ( Before I was having around 2.5-3 l)\n2. 4 soaked almonds\n3. 1 fruit a day \n4. 2 fried fish 3 days a week \n5. Baby leafy greens 4 days a week (Grown by myself in balcony pot just to consume organic)\n6. 2 tsp ghee with rice daily\n7. Limcee vit C; 1 tab daily\n8. Washing my hair every 4th day (3 days gap between 2 washes)\n9. Oiling my hair 1 day before wash day, at night.\nNo measurements, just eyeballing everything into a oil dispenser bottle, shaking it few times & applying. No scalp masage, just use my fingers to distribute the oil properly after bottle application. Oils used\nMustard oil + Castor Oil + 10-15 drop rosemary oil\n10. On wash day I apply paste of 1 big onion, 1tsp methi (soaked overnight), 2-3 tbsp curd and water to thin out. I apply this paste generously to my scalp, cover it with shower cap & leave it on for 1 hour. Later shampoo (H&S) and condition (Loreal)\n\nI tried onion juice 2-3 times and it was too much extra work to extract the juice so I started with onion paste.\n\n\nSome extra information: I don't eat any junk or fried foods even before this time range, Dont enjoy sweet foods in general & didn't exercise before nor exercise now ( I climb up and down stairs of a 4 storey house almost 50 times a day, count that as my exercise)\nI don't consume milk, eggs nor any other nonveg food apart from fish.",

        "body": "Your results are actually amazing for having used it for 6 months only.   \nRosemary oil fights hair loss in at least three different mechanisms, so you’ve definitely picked a great tool to overcome your hair loss. It still needs to be studied more, but you can read a little more about what we know so far about it here.   \nFirst, rosemary has anti-inflammatory qualities. One of the main factors in hair loss is chronic inflammation of the scalp. By reducing inflammation of the scalp, rosemary oil reduces scarring and, consequently, hair loss.   \nSecond, rosemary oil brings down DHT levels by inhibiting the androgen receptors. If the androgen receptors are blocked, they can’t convert testosterone into DHT, and as you probably;y know already, DHT is one of the biggest culprits in hair loss.   \nAnd third, rosemary oil increases blood flow. When you see a smooth, shiny head, that means there is scarring in the area, and hair follicles can’t survive there. In areas with more scarring, there is always less blood flow. Less blood flow, in its turn, results in more scarring. By increasing blood flow in the scalp, rosemary oil reduces scarring and, as a result, reduces hair loss.  \nIf you’ve still been applying it consistently since this post, I’m assuming you see even more regrowth and less hair loss.   \nFor anyone considering using rosemary oil on their scalp, make sure you either dilute it with a carrier oil or use botanical treatments, like gashee hair lotion, that contain rosemary oil. Using pure and undiluted rosemary oil is too harsh for the scalp and can potentially give you a burn.   \n[https://ugro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dr.UGro-Gashee-Laura-1min-25secs-Hi2.mp4](https://ugro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dr.UGro-Gashee-Laura-1min-25secs-Hi2.mp4)",

It’s a little bit longer than waist length. \n\nAnd honestly the changes that helped the absolute most were just to do LESS. I used to spend so much money on different products but now I only use inexpensive drugstore shampoo and a leave in conditioner spray and that’s it. What also really helped was minimising heat exposure. I wash my hair about 3 times a week and let it air dry. Only occasionally I use a flat iron (only about 1 time every couple of weeks). \n\nBut the biggest and best thing I did for my hair was just to massage rosemary oil on my scalp once in a while. I don’t know why but that was like magic for my hair and it grew like crazy. That’s my biggest recommendation. \n\nI am so happy with my current length and I just wanted to share! ",

I just realized if I took some time to really put in the extra effort, my dull looking hair can be shiny and healthy looking. I know achieving nice skin is too volatile and honestly not possible for me, so I'm moving on to hair hahaha\n\nI tried using a rosemary oil product since everyone seems to be obsessed with them these days, but I don't think it's for me. I don't mind the smell, but I seem to be losing more hair, and I haven't seen any results though it's been a few weeks. Am I supposed to lather it on everywhere? Should I not be putting it on my scalp?\n\nEdit: thank you for all the information:) I can’t comment on every single one anymore thanks to the overwhelming amount of assistance, but I am reading each one and taking the advice seriously!

A lot of smoothing hair treatments are heat activated so you may run into a few problems if you don't heat up your hair. \n\nFor example a keratin treatment will make your hair really smooth straight and shiny but it requires you to flat iron your hair. \n\nBe careful with proteins. A good protein mask is great for helping to fill in the cuticle but too much will make your hair fall out.\n\nHair oil is the fastest trick as it's coating the hair. My favorite is expensive, shu uemura essence absolue hair oil, but it is the only hair oil I've found that makes my hair shiny and not greasy looking. Rub into your hands and then run through your hair. only apply a drop at a time and work your way from bottom to top. \n\nHair masks can be helpful as leaving them on can help them soak into the cuticle more. I've heard Japanese masks are the best for shine but haven't tried it yet. I'm waiting for it to arrive. \n\nWater really matters here.

I think that the buildup is irratiting her cus she basically got no fleas on her body but still scratches and itches some parts of her body in periods. What can I do or what might it be?\n\nI've also started using rosemary oil on her fur and skin because of I read that it's good and anti-inflammatory.\n\nPS.

        "body": "Good for you for taking her in, getting rid of the nasty worms, and trying to help her skin heal! \n\nI think you may have to resort to the vet for her skin issues, given that she's not responding to the shampoo you mentioned was recommended by the vet. \n\nI would avoid using any kind of essential oils on her skin - even humans shouldn't put pure essential oils directly on their skin, and many can actually be toxic to dogs. I would stick with the vet-approved shampoo, and see if it improves after a few washes - it's likely that one go won't necessarily do it. I would perhaps try a bath every few days (or whatever the shampoo recommends), and if it persists, then bring it up with the vet when you go for her vaccines. \n\nAs far as potty training, I would encourage you to take her out once an hour, during waking hours, and encouraging her to go. When it gets to be about bedtime, I'd perhaps walk her a little bit further if she hasn't gone, and then once she has, put her to bed in \"her\" spot for the night. My current pup literally arrived potty trained, by fluke (but at 3 months, from her mama), but with previous pups, taking them out frequently, and celebrating/rewarding every time they go outside, worked in a matter of days. \n\nShe's adorable. You are a kind person for taking her in and caring for her. I'm sure you'll get her potty-trained in no time, and once you've seen the vet and assessed her skin issues, you'll be on your way to a long and happy life together! There is nothing so rewarding as the love of a dog, and you've got a sweet little one there. \n\nYou've got this!",

    "body": "Quick back story: I M19 with curly short-medium hair moved to Bengaluru last year and my hair health went down the drain. Hair fall, dandruff, itching, you name it I had it.\n\nI initially went the all-natural route. I got a bottle of Bhringraj oil and started using it. Then i saw a video on youtube about Reetha, Amla, Shikakai powder shampoo. It looked promising and I tried it out and replaced it with my shampoo and conditioner. That was a bad bad decision. I get that all natural is good but you need something to actually cleanse the scalp.\n\nMy hair was falling like crazy, my pillow was full of hair, my comb was full of hair strands, my hands were full of hair strands when i washed my hair. Because of that, i kinda developed a small hairline haha. At first, I was really terrified but at one point, I just accepted my hairline and focused on reducing the hairfall so I can save my hairline.\n\nThat is when I discovered this community. I went through a lot of posts and gathered all the info I had. I did the following things:\n\n1. **Shaved my head**: I know people say that it won't cure your hair problems but I felt like i needed a new start and I think you can focus more on your scalp when you shave your head completely. When I was getting my head shaved. I saw incredible amounts of build up on my hair. This was probably because of my mistake of going all natural for my hair. Bengaluru has hard water and when you wash your head, a lot of these minerals and stuff build up on your scalp. The natural powder shampoo I made did not a good job cleaning all this from my hair and it kept on building and building.\n2. **Using RO water to wash my hair:** This was a literal life saver. I think it is the most effective way to solve your hair problems. I didn't buy a tap filter because it was kinda expensive and I am a student and live here alone and don't take money from my parent haha. I know wasting drinking water is bad but only 5 litres is good enough for someone with short hair for a shampoo and conditioner wash. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so 10-15 litres of water. I bought a bisleri 5 litre bottle and then I keep filling it up when i have to wash my hair. If you use it carefully, 5 litres is more than enough. Use normal water for the rest of your body, just RO water for your hair.\n3. **Castor and Rosemary Oil:** I saw lots of people recommending rosemary oil for hairfall and thought of giving it a try. Since rosemary oil is an essential oil, I used Castor oil as a carrier oil to dilute it. I didn't exactly know the proportions so i was just eyeballing it in the beginning but that was a mistake. I initially used 4-5 drops of rosemary and my scalp had a stinging sensation. I then reduced it to 2 drops and that was the sweet spot for me. Too much rosemary oil can have adverse effects so try out with 1-2 drops and see how it works. I used this [Rosemary OIl](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B01KON8C9S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and this [Castor OIl](https://www.1mg.com/otc/agrawal-castor-oil-otc685256?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={1mg_OTC_Performance_Max}&utm_adgroup={adgroup}&utm_keyword=&wpsrc=Google%20AdWords&wpcid=17431151740&wpsnetn=x&wpkwn=&wpkmatch=&wpcrid=&wpscid=&wpkwid=&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-dSqhfumhwMV0xWDAx3pqQbQEAQYAiABEgKDV_D_BwE). Castor oil is very sticky so do not make the mistake of using it overnight. it will ruin your pillow and face. I applied this 3-4 hours before washing my hair.\n4. **Ketomac Shampoo and Biolage Conditioner:** I went back to the chemical route haha. Many people recommended it for dandruff, and BIolage Conditioner was recommended for hydration. So i thought this is the perfect combo and ordered it. I apply the shampoo and keep it on for 3-4 minutes. Till then, I massage the scalp. I wash it off then apply the conditioner and leave it in for another 5 minutes. I massage again and then wash it off.\n\nThat is pretty much it. I started this routine about a month ago and my hairfall has completely vanished and dandruff is gone too. My hair is still very short as I just shaved my head a month ago. I had budget constraints so had to make this as cost effective as possible. All the products are cost effective and will last. I did not go for the minoxidil route as i saw too many side effects and did not want to use it without a prescription. I guess i don't need it anymore haha.\n\nLastly, I am so thankful to this community. Lots of the youtube videos on youtube are just paid promotions of really bad products and you'll end up worsening your situation more. I got so many insights from here. This routine is going to be pretty helpful for others too I am sure. Also, if you feel anything is wrong in this routine please do let me know. ",

Patience and trusting the process have truly been key throughout this journey.\nI’m currently using both Minoxidil (once daily) and Finasteride. My crown wasn’t done during the procedure, Heva advised that my donor area was too light to effectively cover the crown, so the focus was on achieving strong density from the hairline to mid-scalp instead.\n\nTo support growth and boost overall hair health, 4x a week I’ve also been using a combination of:\n\t•\tJojoba oil\n\t•\tRosemary oil\n\t•\tPumpkin seed oil\n\t•\tPeppermint oil\nI also derma roll twice a week.\nThis blend has helped bring my crown back to a much better state and has really accelerated growth across the board.\nFeel free to check out my previous posts for earlier monthly updates. Happy to answer any questions as always. Cheers!\n",

I’ve been on a ‘healthify’ journey the past 7 years after some bleach damage and not really caring about the quality of my hair. \nI’m pretty proud of my progress 😁\n\nDetails-\n•born with pin-straight, white blonde hair but it’s slowly gotten darker over the years, now it’s pretty golden but a few pregnancies have made my roots come in soooo dark!\n•I’ve had two “lighten/toning” appointments in the past two years but I’ve vowed to never chemically process my hair ever again.\n•I’ve had a few big chops over the years but usually do small trims every 4ish months. \n•oiling treatments on wash day- castor oil + jojoba oil + rosemary oil.\n•daily scalp stimulation with silicone massager.\n•boar bristle brush to distribute oils from my scalp better.\n•I put my hair in a loose braid and wear a silky bonnet to bed to prevent breakage.\n•I’ve used TRESemme Silky and Smooth shampoo and conditioner my entire life. I’ve tried some expensive brands and they don’t really make a huge difference? \n•in the past 6 months I’ve started using Viroi holistic shampoo/conditioner bars to try and have more natural products so I alternate between those and TRESemme.\n•Usually only wash once every 5-7 days.\n•hardly ever use heat, I let my hair air dry straight or put it in a braid. \n•when my hair isn’t down it’s usually in a loose low bun and I use velvet scrunchies.\n\nLooking for recommendations on oils to use daily on my ends that won’t make my hair look or feel greasy. Anything else you’d recommend? \n",

My tech emphasized that K-Tips did little to no damaged to the existing hair when cared for properly. I did a ton of research before pulling the trigger, I looked at her prior work and did a full consultation with my \"specialist.\" I was thrilled with the results after the installation and had previously looked at a ton of examples of good vs. \"shotty\" work, this was good work (as far as I know). I had them in for a total of 4 months and wore my hair down a vast majority of the time. I treated my extensions like a newborn baby, I got a loop extension brush and satin bonnet to sleep in; I gently and throughly brushed them from bottom to top. That being said, I missed being able to to slick my hair back so I  scheduled an appointment with my original tech for a removal, at least for a little while to let my hair rest. Now I have traction alopecia. During the removal appointment my tech continuously mentioned how well I'd taken care of my hair and that there was little to no matting, I was excited to see how my natural hair had grown but when she blew my hair out it just... wasn't there. I easily lost 60% of my hair density and am devastated. I've invested in 5% Minoxidil, rosemary oil, biotin supplements and hair masks to hopefully get back the hair I once had, but its going to take months if not years.\n\nHeed my warning PLEASE, get a halo extension that isn't constantly pulling on your scalp. If you're on the fence about getting K-Tips DON'T, embrace your natural hair or invest in other, healthier options.\n\nNow I'll to return to grieving my full head of hair.",

You’ve gotten used to seeing your hair with considerably more density and volume, and when it’s suddenly gone it’s normal to wonder if you’ve got less hair than when you started. Also, remember all the hair you would have naturally shed during those months were trapped by the k tips. That’s suddenly gone too, when without the extensions you wouldn’t have noticed them gradually shedding. The good news it this is almost certainly not traction alopecia. That takes a very long time to take effect. Like, years. Worst case scenario, the extensions pulled out some individual hairs that weren’t ready to be shed. They will grow back.",

I went to her for the feather tip type I-tips because the metal bead I tips were help growing my hair out but felt heavy. The k tip bond was so thick because she added too much keratin and I lost a bunch of hair at my removal appointment because breaking the bond didn’t remove all the glue from my hair. I lost a bunch. Also, after the first month, it’s not easy getting to your scalp to clean and revitalize it. \n\nPlease don’t do it. KTips have been around for 20 years and they brought it back into fashion and overcharging. It’s a get quick rich scam for hairstylists.\n\nAlso, please note that you have to pull your roots apart the hair strands so they don’t get matted. I don’t know why I didn’t think about this before going through with it. You are RIPPING your hair strands apart VOLUNTARILY and then Wondering why you have no increase in density and a bunch of flyaways.\n\nI-tips are great as long as they are not installed too tightly. I just had I-tips placed and was waiting for my head to hurt that night and felt nothing. I am giving my new hairstylist ALLLL the referrals and alll the tips. She listened to where I wanted the parts, how much density and length- everything. Some hairstylists just want to do what they want to your head, make you look like a Pantene commercial so they can post you on their instagram to scam new clients… meanwhile your head pays the price. \n\nIf you do k-tips, you have to change them out every two months to avoid the matrix and breakage but that still leaves you with the removal process. Unless you get a hairstylist that knows the bonds should be the size of rice, you are risking hair loss.\n\nI-tips are moved up every 8 weeks - no matting, you get to check on the integrity of the hair . The removal process is easy on your hair.\n\nGood luck with whatever you choose. I wish you many glorious hair days!",

The stylist should also move the extensions over a bit and not be placing in the same repetitive spot over and over. This also helps keep your hair in good condition. While wearing extensions, I have also made sure to take my vitamins for hair, skin and nails as well as a biotin supplement to keep my hair strong as I’ve always had thinner hair anyway.

    "body": "It seems there is no space to discuss herbal remedies for hair loss (beyond this subreddit!), without being bombarded by finasteride and minoxidil shills, even when the research around the side effects is seriously under reported. And forget about the fact that finasteride is not FDA-approved for women and still gets prescribed or recommended commonly (with serious side effects to child birth and mental health)\n\nI reposted [this particular post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/1iuvyqa/update_ive_spent_3_years_testing_different_herbs/)from our subreddit to a hair loss group and got so heavily derided that I eventually deleted and decided to quit that group! This is not to to say these prescriptions don't work, but the nature of the \"quick fix\" and one-stop approach that these groups talk about brush a lot of other issues under the carpet.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTLDR version of my original post below, summarizing my key findings after a 3 year experiment with different herbs (all topicals only) + crowdsourcing a lot of great information from this subreddit as well. This time, on popular request, I'm adding reliable sources for each solution:\n\n**What worked (In order of effectiveness)**\n\n1.  [**Eclipta Alba (Bhringraj) + Redensyl + Capilia Longa**](http://ekmiveda.com) regimen *(9.5/10)*\n\n* **Why:** Bhringraj stimulates follicles ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5837201/)), European Larchwood (Redensyl) boosts density ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32473084/)), and Capilia Longa (turmeric extract) blocks DHT. Possibly the best, proven combination of actives that covers all the possible areas. Probably see results as soon as 3 months. \n* **How to use:** Oil massage in mornings, gentle cleansers, lightweight serum overnight.\n* **Source:** Only place I found this combination was here at [Ekmiveda](https://ekmiveda.com). \n\n[**2. Saw Palmetto (8/10)**](https://www.amazon.com/Palmetto-Extract-Capsules-Supplement-Horbaach/dp/B07SSVC2LB)\n\n* **Why:**  Known DHT blocker (better for men, but some women respond).\n* **How:** Capsules or tea. Takes 6+ months but with other treatments and solutions.\n* **Source:** Lot of sources like this. [Capsule form: Nature's bounty saw palmetto](https://naturesbounty.com/products/saw-palmetto-450-mg-250-capsules). [Capsules: Horbaach saw palmetto Extract 3600mg](https://www.amazon.com/Palmetto-Extract-Capsules-Supplement-Horbaach/dp/B07SSVC2LB)\n\n[**3. Rosemary + Castor Oil (7/10)**](https://skyorganics.com/products/organic-rosemary-strong-roots-oil?srsltid=AfmBOooln_i4hfsy1q_9hW5Z3a0ARAac4vT_fcvQM8ZYK7Bd3G7IpWOr)\n\n* **Why?** Not very strong clinical evidence. But popular anecdotes from people. Studies are a bit inconclusive as well. Didn't work for me, but a lot of redditors have said it works.\n* **How:** 1:1 mix, 1hr pre-wash. Slow but steady.\n* **Source:** Personally used [Sky Organics Rosemary roots Oil](https://skyorganics.com/products/organic-rosemary-strong-roots-oil?srsltid=AfmBOooln_i4hfsy1q_9hW5Z3a0ARAac4vT_fcvQM8ZYK7Bd3G7IpWOr) or Sky Organics Organic Amla & Rosemary Oil\n\n**4. Amla + Hibiscus + Fenugreek (6.5/10)**\n\nShoutout to my mum who has the strongest, longest locks I’ve ever seen anyone have! A homemade Ayurvedic mask for strengthening hair. No clinical research here - just straight up ancient wisdom passed down my grandmothers!\n\n**Source:** [Amla powder](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Powder-Amalaki-Non-GMO-Natural/dp/B096KWR1PK/ref=sr_1_6?crid=22MRYBHLIEI1A&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TrE6umoMke3dZvfADJXwHnWzlJMTZFU9eb90cPnsXMVlvli6erqq1eMRalW5ELY7xsqllHdcHs07Rq_pKfk3QLGUPA-Qd0S2VPiCd6fbmmFrZSyTj5mcTJBuUCGi67EjnmeZWCcBdCuOwWZ5Vhdjrx1a8mxQ7yomS_Hgfk_toQhI-QDS5zW1DF2JC0NHrMIVyYxkN2oqi2XBHSb_NQBOqsqV_2nSoecNSpACt3XGVImofHkfu82Zk7DQbwyEd8DQu-KGpGgdOHD6EYknqf75zawAu6SkF6uyORTeAIHsjqr5GriWMbKSRn26z_Khs_1pAgi3Ano6pVsyWi6UVq_mIUVRFEDpq-XyvwZZP6mGobQRrGY6FE5PlKTj8QmuovG2gtWCkRSRFDeJ7hKaUo5m9qr0vnzELp0hryfhN6IKagKmTOWeVOY_dl2CoFDut37H.kKbPE39Lcd-st9gk0-O7zEfmr3GRs16ERlkFd4LHNIk&dib_tag=se&keywords=amla+powder&qid=1740157977&sprefix=amla+powde%2Caps%2C514&sr=8-6), [Fenugreek powder](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Fenugreek-methi-Seeds-Powder/dp/B08KLB6QW1/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1FS9WYNZPB8X7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.VjL-3Rq26LWUjlkGZH-edp3xw0itkr36OGv4oYJ68Sp2zzvo3bUQPL1eIaPrqWOTQWrj-h_2LShPbE9uuQd9s6mdHMEkj_rMEcilSJiAA_bjXBSKbzetZp2C429xTm2azhLR7i4gKdfFsTKsKhBVZUvU0bO_ysNMSszDhjTOjwYblx_8omzTOKmE99BtM-_pOWV2oppYpR3qBxT7ASdfn3XqH4xwNf9XiDO12Gl_WMQdGpF5PO8HEW6a8ca3zPrlO-MwJx7fpu6xmo1Nx7biQIrR291KeFppEoiL0i3d2wLP-7haT3aZaz6LbGF1YiNRlFOeGkUCtZOn_oSXyHd5Hs5RVUcVG5m2nBag5D7mD_xFxVxk_vyf3ugBS1gG-hjHgGEtkK7UlTK99dzlHtcmbD8rSCI7EMA_rrr2aZX9OMdHyGA-u7CkFzm6dXp197yD.0jweneABoQSh8J_xQT_bwBm2qsuMZZaFpKHBN6FYxHg&dib_tag=se&keywords=fenugreek%2Bpowder&qid=1740158025&sprefix=fenugreek%2Bpowd%2Caps%2C363&sr=8-6&th=1), [Hibiscus Powder](https://www.amazon.com/MB-Herbals-Hibiscus-safdariffa-Refreshing/dp/B07GWT4K5W/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=G92IFB1LCY88&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oFnkGr2i3lViBj-7g6gD41O3vucyRQzWAXRv3XutrbLZY-AABj2uaDjCpN9tBA02LdbQBvv2lvM4vU6_ZK60bancNC_Knv3cXj-hjaaTvvqVCJy8nxCF7X9Ry0WGvGeXzVDC7EqJM2l3t9FlKeq5Pu3djY321gVzu8WOJkNsvDReGyVDvy3bGL9jmjD-V062YkrMA1kI5_U6XRmk_goqF017I6apksUtU2kCfN6JfIhYX0Hjr54TyFmrwKvRCaBzNlmt8qjE8U16tNSST0drG8eqgVaLk8WcH0vELU3xwiY.e-_YDKKydf0XlkYudIbTwTNukZUvh9LCUzTqdAcnU98&dib_tag=se&keywords=hibiscus+powder&qid=1740158007&sprefix=hibiscus+pow%2Caps%2C444&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nUpdate 2:\n\n**Some other takeaways after talking to folks from this subreddit:**\n\n* Herbs aren’t magic but neither is minoxidil. Both require consistency. But some serious side effects have been pushed under the carpet for the latter.\n* Women’s hair loss can often hormonal/nutritional (test ferritin/Vit D!)\n* Big Pharma’s \"quick-fix\" is often the fin-min bandaid that is slapped everywhere! A lot of folks have confirmed the same to me in DMs after their interactions with dermats. There seems to be no regulatory guardrail on how these are prescriped nowadays. (See more in my [rant/post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jwrmvx/most_pharma_solutions_for_women_are_just_heres_a/)here on r/offmychest)\n* Diet and lifestyle is a must-fix to ensure nutrient absorption in the scalp.\n\nPlease do share your findings if you've observed other solutions for hair loss. Some other notable herb mentions: Black seed oil,  Coconut oil, Brahmi.\n\nA post on diet and lifestyle to come soon!",

There used to be a great product available that combined them both but they changed the formula and it sucks now so I make my own. I didn’t find it to help with hair loss but it does make my roots more voluminous, so I use it for that reason. I’ve recently started taking Amla capsules as a source of vitamin C. I lost some hair at the crown in 2011 and I’ve tried just about everything in the book to get it back except minoxidil and other preparations. They’ve been prescribed to me but I just have a hangup about that sort of treatment. I prefer herbal or other natural remedies or preparations as much as possible. I’ve recently started PRP treatment, so we will see how that goes.",

Herbalism has a rich global history. The first pharmaceuticals stem from studying plants, and isolating chemicals form plants, and plants are chock-full of chemicals so much so they are complex to study scientifically, hence why they prefer to isolate chemicals from plants. They are just ignorant to this given the propaganda stemming from big pharma. I would say in general plants are more effective, its a matter of knowing the right plants for ones biochemistry, which can take some trial and error, and boom it can do wonders. Alot of pharma meds are one med for a multitude of people but herbalism is more tailored to the unique individual and their constitution. it's just that the herb that works for me may not work for you and vice versa, but thankfully, we have an abundance of options for most things. \n\nI understand perfectly well what you experience. I am big into DIY stuff and I have gotten those types of remarks many times. I came into herbalism given how horrible medicine treats women with endo, so I learned to make my own medicine to manage the pain, and I have never gone back. This path is not for everyone, and many times it is for those of us who are done relying on a failed system that has made it clear they have no regard for us. We are trialiblazers, reviving the medicine of our ancestors and reconnecting with the Earth. Some of them will come around eventually as that system continues to not meet the needs of the public, and more people will come back home. \n\nHugs to you I know it hurts to deal with their mean remarks, they can be so cruel sometimes, anytime someone doesn't follow the regulated \"norm\".",

I use Raw Sugar the truly unruly shampoo on my scalp, then apply a Shea moisture protein mask for 10 minutes and rinse. After that, I use the Raw Sugar conditioner and rinse it out until there is just a little bit of conditioner left. Finally, I apply jojoba and rosemary oil from roots to end and let air dry or diffuse on cool. Every night, I reapply a little oil to the ends and sleep with a silk cap and pillowcase.

    "body": "Hello Guys, \n\nI've never used this platform, but I thought I'd share my post finasteride update for some of you, especially those who suffer with diffused thinning. But first and foremost, before I come to the pictures, I'd like to make some things clear.\n\nMy hairloss started with the age of 23, when my ex mentioned that my hair on the mid-scalp looks very thin, when we were on vacation. It bothered me a lot because I thought to myself \"I'm only 23 years old, I can't go bald already\". So I started using rosemary oil with some other oil, but it didn't matter how much of it I used and how frequently it was, the hair was getting thinner and thinner. Until at some point I made a photo at my worst\n\n[I used to have a widows peak since I was a child, but as you guys can see, the corners are getting dangerously thin and the middle part started diffusing as well](https://preview.redd.it/jdccv3uk453f1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e13a360c8a9a45a90bbbaad239eac67f08acba4)\n\nWhen I saw this picture I was devastated, because it hurt my ego a lot. Even my top was diffussing as well.\n\n[Top thinning, it didn't matter how much I combed it over, you could always see the bald line and even see through my bald head from the side when the lighting was unfortunate.](https://preview.redd.it/s5sob3ox453f1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d1aecf0b67c7107fbd1758a9ad37acba136d41a)\n\nI figured that the hairloss shape I'll have will be all around the mid-scalp, crown and corners by diffused thinning until you could peak through every corner on the top of my hair. For me, that's the worst type of hair loss because you won't be able to hide it once it reaches a Norwood 3-4.  \n  \nWhen I consulted a dermatologist, he told me after careful check-ups that I'm in the beginning stage of androgenetic alopecia. I asked him what I can possibly do, and he suggested either a hair transplant when I've lost all my hair, or to hop on finasteride.   \nI was quite aware of the side effects because I was awake almost every night, checking my hair on every given occassion. It bothered me so much that I was even scared to go out. But I thought to myself, I'll test it and if side effects occur, I'll accept my fate as a bald guy.\n\nLuckily for me, no side effects ever occured, and I'm very healthy. When I first started the medication, of course, I checked on the mirror everyday looking for a change in my hair. I started counting my vellus hairs like a maniac, but nothing occured until this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ax0nkqjw553f1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e628a3cccc02a06437a078dcdc2b03df3ed2669b\n\nI noticed tiny vellus hairs forming on the top of my head after 3 months and I was so surprised, but unfortunately, those vellus hairs have been there all the time, and I just imagined it. The 4th month passed by, the 5th, the 6th, and the 7th. Nothing changed and I accepted the fact, that it will probably just stop the hairloss and not reverse it.\n\nMy goal always was to feel better about my hair, not change the haircount or get lighter hair or anything. I just wanted to feel alright and I thought it will probably be a hair transplant. \n\nOn the 8th month, I didn't really checked my hair because I accepted my fate, but I noticed something on the 9th month. My hair got so thick and elastic all of the sudden. It didn't feel like straw like it used to, it felt like real hair for the first time in years. And in those next 2 months, so much has happened. It felt like my hair got thicker from day to day\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rdvooyc2753f1.jpg?width=797&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ad865706b552f65be26a2ad551845cbcb428b69\n\nThe haircount never really changed, but the overall thickness made the hair feel so much smoother, it's like it reversed the effects of the DHT sensitivity. I could grow very long hair \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fds0hoji753f1.jpg?width=784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29f87b324d9496c557cf190008611dfb177cd4e7\n\nHere a little comparison of how thin my hair was without finasteride back in September 2023 When I turned 24\n\nAnd today: after I got a cut, this is how my hair looks like:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk3rfzyq753f1.jpg?width=532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7cf5c465f8385e51c58f4f85b35afed63994144\n\nI'm quite happy with the results I got, and I advise anyone who uses finasteride without side effects to have patience and trust the process. It changed my perception of confidence and I'm so happy with myself :)",

Its been a long time since Ive used a protein treatment (before I shaved my head, last year- it had been bleached for a long time and used to respond super well to aphogee 2 step, light on the 2nd step), but I have no idea what the porosity of my uncolored hair is and I'm unsure whether it'll cause protein overload. Any thoughts? Anyone have similar struggles?",

And while you're waiting for it to do its thing maybe look into a topper? You have great hair and there are so many options to choose from. Think about it. I wish you the best.",

Dermarolling and rosemary oil will never be enough.\n\nLike everyone said, you should start Minoxidil right now. Just like you I've been waiting for years because I heard a lot of bad stuff about Minox. And when I started committing to it I realized not only it does work, but also it doesn't have as many secondary effects as everyone says. \n\nDon't trust influencers who say an oil can treat AGA, don't trust hair clinics who just sell expensive products. You should trust doctors and take real medicine to handle the problem.\n\nBeauty industry wants us to think we're not normal, but they're wrong. A lot of people have the same insecurity, it's a very common thing. There's no reason to cry about it, you're beautiful no matter what !",

Oral or topical?\nI use Minox like 2-3 times a week and I put some rosemary oil and castor oil on it, maybe like once or twice a week.

Figuring out that simple is better for fine hair has been a turning point for me. This is what I do:\n\nI'm currently trying hair oiling so I leave rosemary oil in for a couple hours before washing it. I brush my hair before washing it. This is the only time I brush my hair. I wash twice with OGX rosemary mint shampoo and use argan oil conditioner from creme of nature. Once I'm out of the shower I mix not your mother's curl talk and Aussie instant freeze in my hands and scrunch it into my hair, trying to finger comb any tangles I might have gotten during washing. I plop my hair for about 30 minutes and let it air dry. Lastly, when my hair is completely dry I scrunch the gel and it's done. The specific products I use in my routine that have made the biggest difference is definitely my shampoo and hair gel. I think my other products could probably be swapped out and it wouldn't hurt. I'll also put a little of my rosemary oil on the ends of my hair if it needs it.\n\nNot sure about the best way to refresh these as they're ruined once I sleep but I'm very happy with this!",
