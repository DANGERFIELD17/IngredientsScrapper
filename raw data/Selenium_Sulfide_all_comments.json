    "body": "When I was a kid, I would shower and immediately go to bed without drying my hair. I also had dandruff issues since I could remember. Having an itchy scalp and the occasional teasing from kids was a mild annoyance, so I never sought a remedy.\n\nAs an adult, I started using selenium sulfide shampoos that immediately cured my dandruff. It became my daily shampoo for the next 15 years. Somewhere along the line, I also started showering earlier so my hair would dry to avoid bed head. One day my barber mentioned my hair smelled like sulfur as if I was using too much dandruff shampoo. She said I dont need daily treatments with that stuff. So I stopped to see how long it takes for the dandruff to come back so I could make a schedule. It never did.\n\nOne random day some years later I suddenly had dandruff. It was at this moment that I finally thought about why I had dandruff. Why now after all these years? I always assumed it was genetic. What changed recently? Was it something I'm doing and not genetic? Then it occured to me. I had a pair of long nights a couple days ago. I showered , but was too tired to dry my hair and fell asleep. I finally googled \"wet hair and dandruff\" and gained closure for my childhood affliction.\n\nIf anyone else out there has a dandruff problem, wet hair cultivates existing microbes in your scalp that causes dandruff. I was propagating them on my pillow every night for 15 years.\n\nTL;DR I slept with wet hair regularly as a kid resulting in moderate dandruff until I was an adult.\n\n*Edit. Glad my post helped all you other flaky headed goobers. Be advised there's other reasons why dandruff occurs so your mileage may vary. Thanks for the awards and rip inbox.",

        "body": "I work for a dermatologist and it is true that wet hair can cause dandruff, what we call seborrheic dermatitis. It’s caused by an excess amount of yeast on our scalp from moisture (we all have yeast on our scalp, but this is an overproduction). It can also cause skin colored bumps on your forehead (pityrosporum folliculitis) that people like to confuse for acne bumps. You can control this by blow drying your hair to reduce the overproduction of yeast and to wash with Head and Shoulders shampoo (recommend just shampoo, not the 2-in-1 with conditioner), let sit in hair for 6-8 minutes, then rinse off. You can do this every other day for maintenance. Hope this helps! :)\n\n**Disclaimer: I am not a medical physician, and am only providing advice per experience working as an Medical Assistant at a dermatologist.",

Apple Cider Vinegar rinses - NOT dandruff shampoo - will help your hair.  Dandruff shampoo can totally strip your hair, causing your scalp to overproduce oil in response, which leads to more dandruff.   A lot of oil on your scalp means skin has a hard time naturally flaking off, and you get build up of dead skin cells, which clump up and become visible dandruff.",

Still I had really bad dandruff- more of a seasonal kind(more during summer months, as it gets really hot and humid around here). \n\n\nIn 2019, I did a smoothening treatment, and I had no dandruff issues for a good while. I failed to follow up with the treatment, and after an year, I started to get really flaky and bad dandruff- which would drop on my clothes and everywhere I went. I still used to shower in the mornings. I applied anti dandruff medications twice a week but it was of no help.Then I finally decided to chop off a good length of my hair and let my natural curls grow back. Meanwhile I bought a scalp shampoo massager and also a milder shampoo. Also started a deep conditioning routine. And suddenly all my dandruff was gone- totally gone! And it made me so so happy! It cleared all my scalp related issues. \n\n\nNow I'm encouraging my dad to use the scalp massager too-he has had very bad dandruff issues for a long time(though he showers in the morning and never goes to bed with wet hair). I don't know if that would work for him, but let's see anyways!",

After finally passing them I had them sent in to be analyzed and the cause came back as chronic dehydration.

I also realized that this completely eliminated my dandruff problem to where I don't even think about it anymore.\n\n It seems obvious but not having enough water would of course lead to dry itchy skin.

    "body": "**Latest Updates on 9 Oct 2023:**\n\n* **Hair shedding: shedding 10-20 hairs per day! back to my pre-sebderm level.**\n* ***Hair thickness: GUYS my hair has grown back!!! back to my pre-sebderm hair thickness now!!! Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

    "body": "Ed eccoci ancora qua per la seconda parte della guida sulla dermatite seborroica.\n\nQui trovate la prima parte per chi se la fosse persa: [prima parte](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/xjns2b/skincare_e_dermatite_seborroica_guida_completa/).\n\nAnzitutto vi ringrazio per il caloroso supporto nella precedente puntata. Sono molto felice di aver contribuito alla discussione e in tantissimi mi avete chiesto un'opinione sugli shampoo.\n\nPrima di iniziare, ci tengo a ribadire un concetto: **della dermatite seborroica non abbiamo capito un cazzo e non c'è una cura definitiva.** E' terribile, ma purtroppo viviamo in un sistema dove fare ricerca scientifica non conviene. Le case di dermocosmesi preferiscono tenere tutto vago per provare a vendere qualsiasi stupidaggine possibile. Nessuno ha un incentivo a fare degli studi seri e quei pochi che si fanno sono ridicoli, si parla di campioni da 10 persone. \n\nIo, come nella guida precedente, esporrò una serie di consigli pratici il quanto più possibile radicati nella ricerca scientifica. Ma siccome questa non ci dà una risposta definitiva, l'invito è sempre quello di sperimentare e se avete trovato un prodotto/routine che per voi funziona non posso che essere felice per voi.\n\nFaccio anche una premessa importante: io ho dei capelli grassissimi che producono una quantità d'olio imbarazzante. I miei consigli sono pensati per chi come me ha lo stesso tipo di cuoio capelluto.\n\n# Parte 1: Il piano d'attacco\n\nNella prima parte della guida spiegavo come la dermatite seborroica si pensa sia causata dalla malassezia: un lievito che vive sulla nostra pelle e nel 3% della popolazione causa rossori ed ipersensibilità.\n\nIl problema forte è che non basta uccidere la malassezia per far sparire il problema. Tutta quanta l'incertezza scientifica sulla causa della dermatite seborroica, deriva dal fatto che anche una volta morta la malassezia, o addirittura anche solo componenti di essa rimaste sulla pelle, possono scatenare reazioni infiammatorie.\n\nIl nostro piano d'attacco deve dunque avere 3 priorità, che vanno in questo ordine:\n\n1.\t**Fare di tutto per impedire che la malassezia cresca**: siccome anche da morta sembra causare danni, il nostro obiettivo principale è fare in modo che non cresca proprio. Per fare questo dobbiamo da un lato deprivarla del suo cibo naturale (i trigliceridi a catena lunga, in pratica il grasso della nostra pelle) e dall'altro stare molto attenti ai prodotti che ci mettiamo sulla testa. Soprattutto le donne, che spesso usano balsami e molti altri ingredienti per la cura dei capelli. Se gli diamo da mangiare attivamente è la fine. La cosa peggiore in assoluto che si possa fare è qualche trattamento strano con l'olio d'oliva \"come facevano i nostri nonni\".\n2.\t**Gestire il prurito**: questa è la seconda priorità assoluta. Perchè? Perchè se avete prurito vi grattate e se vi grattate è un cazzo di casino. Quando vi grattate andate a danneggiare la barriera protettiva della pelle. Questo rende da un lato la pelle più suscettibile alle irritazioni e dall'altro si rende molto più difficile il corretto assorbimento dei prodotti da parte della pelle. Purtroppo grattarsi è un gesto spesso inconscio, quindi l'unico vero modo di affrontare la cosa è gestire fin da subito il prurito.\n3.\t**Uccidere la malassezia**: solo alla fine, come terza priorità, cerchiamo dei prodotti che ammazzino la malassezia. Questo aiuta soprattutto durante gli attacchi più pesanti e con i dolori acuti per mantenere sotto controllo il problema.\n\nCi tengo a stressare in particolare modo l'importanza di questo specifico ordine di priorità. \n\nSe ci pensate un attimo, è lo stesso identico motivo per cui non basta usare il collutorio per avere denti sani. Non basta uccidere i batteri, ma dobbiamo con lo spazzolino andare a rimuovere ciò di cui si nutrono. Solo così riusciamo a mantere in salute i nostri denti.\n\nPer gli amici ingegneri, il perchè intrinseco lo si trova nel \"modello logistico\". E' la stessa logica per cui non serve disinfestare le città per eliminare i topi definitivamente, ma bisogna tenere pulito e salubre il luogo in cui si vive. L'idea è che fintanto che c'è cibo a disposizione, tutti questi fenomeni sono governati da processi di crescita esponenziale. Quindi, non puoi pensare di uccidere la malassezia per rallentare una crescita esponenziale, dopo due ore siamo punto e a capo. Dobbiamo cambiare \"l'ambiente\" della malassezia affinchè, a livello strutturale, non ci sia cibo a sufficienza per sostenere una popolazione più grande di un certo numero di esemplari.\n\n# Parte 2: Gli ingredienti con evidenza scientifica (per i capelli) \n\nCredo di avervi stressato abbastanza con il concetto di prima. Ma ciò nonostante, quali sono gli ingredienti per combattere la dermatite seborroica?\n\nAnche qua, come spesso accade nel mondo della dermocosmesi, ci sono una miriade di minchiate e giusto una manciata di agenti attivi veramente efficaci. Non tutti sono adatti a qualsiasi tipo di cuoio capelluto, ma qua ci concentreremo sui principali per capelli grassi.\n\n1.\t**Disolfuro di selenio (selenium sulfide):** E' un antimicotico che rallenta la crescita della malassezia ed un agente cheratolitico (ovvero favorisce il ricambio superficiale degli strati della pelle). Può aiutare anche a gestire il prurito. Come funziona? Bho! Non si è capito molto del perchè abbia questi effetti o come li produca. Quello che sappiamo è che in alcuni studi da circa 250 persone (credetemi, sono sorprendentemente grandi per questo ambito della dermocosmesi) ha un'efficacia significativamente maggiore di un corrispettivo placebo. Al momento lo si sta anche studiando per eventuali utilizzi sugli occhi. Servirebbe a regolarizzare la produzione di olio dalle ghiandole che gestiscono il film oleo-acquoso che previene la secchezza oculare. **Fun Fact**: Raga io vi giuro, quando ero piccolo c'era un film / cartone animato dove c'erano questi che dovevano sconfiggere gli alieni. Un tizio scopriva che per loro il selenio era tossico e si andavano a comprare le bottiglie di shampoo antiforfora per sconfiggere gli alieni. Ve lo giuro non sono pazzo, ho questo ricordo stampato nel mio cervello.\n2.\t**Piroctone Olamina**: anche questo ingrediente viene utilizzato come antimicotico, ma sembra avere anche proprietà antisettiche più generalizzate. La sua efficacia sembra legata alla capacità di penetrare e spaccare la parete cellulare dei lieviti (oltre che di vari batteri). Spesso si trova insieme, o in sostituzione, dello Zinco piritione che ha effetti simili. Lo Zinco piritione, per chi si ricordasse qualcosa di biologia dalle superiori, nello specifico va a bloccare la pompa protonica delle cellule, andando a spaccare quel meccanismo che consente alle cellule di scambiare elementi con l'esterno.\n3.\t**Ketoconazolo (Nizoral):** Ne abbiamo già parlato ed è uno degli antimicotici più efficaci sul mercato contro la malassezia. Oltre che in pomata, è presente anche sotto forma di shampoo per trattare attacchi acuti di dermatite.\n\nIn questo caso non dirò that's it, perchè ci sono a disposizione anche altri 3-4 ingredienti efficaci (Climbazole, Ciclopirox Olamine, Coal Tar). Ma conoscendo i 3 di cui sopra, più o meno avete un'idea di tutto quanto quello che c'è nell'80% degli shampoo antiforfora seri.\n\nInoltre, terrei sempre anche d'occhio la presenza degli ingredienti di cui abbiamo parlato nella guida sulla skincare. La **niacinamide** aiuta sempre con i rossori e **l'acido salicilico** è alla base della maggior parte dei trattamenti che si possono fare applicati direttamente al cuoio capelluto.\n\n# Parte 3: La routine e i consigli sui prodotti\n\nOra che abbiamo capito gli ingredienti e la filosofia alla base della routine, dobbiamo mettere tutto in pratica.\n\nL'aspetto più importante in assoluto è **la costanza.** Ricordate che il nostro obiettivo numero uno è evitare che la malassezia cresca fin dal principio. La costanza nella routine è la chiave. Io devo per forza farmi una doccia al giorno con gli shampoo. Mi basta saltare anche solo 2 giorni per avere immediatamente a distanza di poco tempo un attacco. A quel punto c'è poco da fare, si può solo contenere l'episodio. Questo perchè come abbiamo visto, anche da morta la malassezia sembra causare danni e reazioni infiammatorie.\n\nLo so che è palloso e spesso sono io il primo a non starci dietro, però per chi come noi soffre di questa patologia, tenere puliti e non grassi i capelli è la cosa più importante in assoluto.\n\nUn consiglio che dò a tutti è di comprarsi a 2/3€ delle bottigliette vuote da riempire con i nostri prodotti per quando si viaggia. Cercate di portarli sempre con voi, altrimenti le vacanze (o il ritorno) rischiano di essere rovinati.\n\nAltra cosa fondamentale, come detto, è quello di assicurarsi che nessun ingrediente alimenti la malassezia. Fortunatamente esiste questo sito web [https://www.sezia.co/](https://www.sezia.co/) che vi consente di identificare quali ingredienti non vanno bene. Per qualsiasi prodotto non dedicato alla cura della dermatite seborroica che volete utilizzare, andate ad inserire gli ingredienti lì dentro e vedete se può causare problemi o meno. In alternativa c'è anche questo database più dettagliato: https://folliculitisscout.com\n\nQuando andate dal parrucchiere / barbiere, declinate ogni prodotto a meno che non sappiate con precisione cosa ci sia dentro.\n\nPer quanto riguarda la routine vera e propria, quale ingrediente devo scegliere? Siete pronti? Lo volete proprio sapere? Rullo di tamburi... **Il gold standard è fare un mix and match.**\n\nNon sappiamo per quale motivo, ma dopo qualche settimana dall'inizio di un trattamento, la malassezia sembra smettere di rispondere. C'è chi dice che sia lo sviluppo di una qualche resistenza, chi dice che ci sia qualche biofilm protettivo che si viene a creare insieme ad altre comunità di funghi e batteri. Non lo sappiamo.\n\nPerò penso che tanti di noi abbiano trovato \"lo shampoo magico\" che per 1 mese ha funzionato e poi, boom! Di colpo un nuovo attacco.\n\nIl consiglio principale è quello di utilizzare un mix degli ingredienti sopra citati. Questo sembra prolungare di molto l'efficacia dei trattamenti.\n\nLa routine diventa dunque questa:\n\n1.\t**Trattamento per cuoio capelluto all'acido salicilico**: da utilizzare 1/2 volte a settimana. Questo è l'unico vero trattamento applicato direttamente al cuoio capelluto prima del lavaggio. Io personalmente uso \"The Inkey list - Salicylic Acid Exfoliating Scalp Treatment\". Molto competitivo dal punto di vista del prezzo per essere un acido salicilico ed ha un packaging pensato per l'applicazione sul cuoio capelluto. E' fondamentale per rimuovere scaglie, accumuli di sebo e quant'altro.\n2.\t**Disolfuro di Selenio:** da utilizzare 2/3 volte a settimana. Io utilizzo Vichy Dercos Technique per capelli grassi (che contiene anche lui acido salicilico, quindi magari questo shampoo non va insieme al trattamento). Attenzione che la linea dercos ha tanti prodotti con ingredienti diversi, quindi assicuratevi di comprare quello giusto.\n3.\t**Piroctone Olamina:** da utilizzare 2/3 volte a settimana. Io qua utilizzo i classici head & shoulders. Vi segnalo che alcuni possono includere \"Glycol Distearate\" che può nutrire la malassezia. Tuttavia la formulazione nel suo complesso sembra efficace e personalmente non mi ha mai dato problemi.\n4.\t**Ketoconazolo (Nizoral Shampoo)**: da utilizzare 1/2 volte a settimana. In caso di attacchi, diventa il vostro shampoo principale e l'utilizzo va potenziato a 3/4 volte a settimana.\n\nFacendo un buon mix di questi shampoo ed utilizzando la routine di skincare proposta precedentemente, la gestione della dermatite seborroica cambia completamente. Vedrete proprio una pella diversa, di un altro tipo, più pulita e lucente.\n\nIo spero che questi consigli possano tornarvi utili e se non altro a dare un po' di consapevolezza in cosa ci sia nei prodotti che ci mettiamo addosso ogni giorno.",

Sin da piccolo ho avuto problemi con croste da latte e forfora e negli anni e mi è stata diagnosticata una psoriasi che poi nell' età della pubertà è andata pian piano affievolendo. Nei periodi di ricaduta mi uscivano solo delle piccole chiazze rosse e fin quì tutto molto gestibile. Il fattaccio è iniziato solo quando ho raggiunto i 29 anni,dallo scoppio della pandemia. 15 giorni dalla seconda dose di moderna è iniziato il mio calvario con il prurito in testa,che fino a prima ( nonostante i miei vari problemi sin dalla nascita con dermatiti) non avevo mai avuto. Da allora sono stato in cura da molti dermatologi che sostengono che io ho un caso di dermatite seborroica. Ho fatto prove allergiche,provato shampoo,creme cortisoniche e lozioni a più non posso ma nulla è stato in grado di risolvere questo problema. Fortunatamente non ho problemi di caduta di capelli però ancora oggi non riesco a tamponare il problema,prurito che va e viene di continuo. Rossore e irritazioni credo,che non si curano né col sole,né evitando momenti di stress,ne con acqua di mare. Da un pò ho iniziato a lasciare qualsiasi prodotto ds e utilizzare solo shampoo idratanti. Chissà,spero davvero di venirne a capo,sono stanco di buttare soldi,ho cambiato 5 dermatologi e uno di loro mi ha tenuto in cura un anno senza arrivarne a capo. Spero di farcela 💪🏻 un abbraccio psicologico a chiunque abbia la mia stessa condizione",

Finally last month, I visited another recommended dermatologist. He diagnosed my scalp condition as sebo psoarisis. Turns out I was asked to use Clobetasol Gel for a month and use a shampoo containing selenium sulfide (the Selsun ingredient) AND clotrimazole.\n\nFast forward a month, scalp has completely cleared up and I’m only using the shampoo now. It’s amazing to have a clean scalp after so long and not go nuts scratching it. \n\nJust to be clear the Gel is a strong one and shouldn’t be used for more than a month. \n\nI’ve spent years trying even natural remedies (hello lemon, aloe, fenugreek paste and others) and read up everything I could on dandruff to help my situation. This is the only thing that has worked.  I just wanted to share it with others who’ve gone through or are going through what I did. :) ",

Types of Hair Problems (3 Main Areas)\n\nAll common hair problems fall into one of these:\n\n1. **Hair Roots (Hair Below the Scalp)** – Hair fall, thinning, reduced density\n2. **Hair Strands (Hair Above the Scalp)** – Dryness, breakage, roughness\n3. **Scalp Issues** – Dandruff, oiliness, itching, inflammation\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧠 2. Hair Root Care – Stop Hair Fall & Grow Stronger Hair\n\nHair fall starts when hair roots weaken or hair becomes thinner. If ignored, it leads to visible scalp and low density.\n\n🛑 **Step 1: Block DHT**\n\n* **Finasteride 1 mg/day** (tablet or topical): Blocks DHT (main reason for male hair loss).\n* Recommended if hair loss is **Stage 2 or more** on Norwood scale.\n\n**💉 Step 2: Improve Blood Flow to Hair Roots**\n\n* **Minoxidil 5%**: Increases blood supply to hair follicles, delivering more nutrients.\n* Apply once or twice daily.\n* For very early hair fall (Stage 1–2), some doctors prefer starting with **caffeine-based or peptide serums** first.\n\n**💊 Step 3: Provide Proper Nutrients**\n\nEven if blood supply increases, without the right nutrients, hair won’t grow strong. Include:\n\n|Supplement|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Strengthens hair strands|\n|**Multivitamin (with Zinc, Vitamin D, and B-complex)**|Fixes hidden deficiencies|\n|**Omega-3 or Fish Oil**|Reduces inflammation, nourishes follicles|\n\n**🧪 Step 4: Peptide-Based Serums (for Root Stimulation)**\n\nThese serums contain **plant-based peptides and natural growth factors** that help activate weak or resting follicles without the side effects of stronger medications.\n\n|Serum|Key Ingredients|Benefits|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Redensyl**|DHQG + EGCG2|Activates hair stem cells, reduces hair fall|\n|**Capixyl**|Biomimetic peptide + red clover|Strengthens follicles, reduces inflammation|\n|**Anagain**|Pea sprout extract|Extends hair growth phase (anagen)|\n|**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Hair Serum**|Blend of multiple peptides|Boosts density, nourishes scalp|\n\n✅ Best used **once daily** on a dry scalp. Can be combined with microneedling (1–2x/week) for better absorption.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 💇‍♀️ 3. Hair Strand Care – Improve Hair Texture, Strength & Shine\n\nThis is the visible part of hair above the scalp. You need to:\n\n**🧴 Use Hair Oil (Carefully)**\n\n* Oil gives moisture and reduces breakage.\n* But **avoid putting oil on the scalp** too often — it can cause dandruff or feed fungus.\n* Apply oil **only on the hair length**, 1–2 times a week, and **wash off properly**.\n\n**🧼 Use Conditioner (Not on Scalp)**\n\n* After shampoo, apply conditioner **only on hair strands** to reduce dryness and tangles.\n\n**💆 Use Hair Mask (Deep Conditioning Treatment)**\n\nHair masks are like super-conditioners. Use them 1–2 times a week to:\n\n* Deeply moisturize dry hair\n* Make hair soft, smooth, and shiny\n* Reduce frizz and split ends\n\n🧴 Choose masks with ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter, keratin, or aloe vera.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧴 4. Scalp Care – Keep the Scalp Clean, Healthy, and Flake-Free\n\nHealthy scalp = healthy hair roots.\n\n**Common Scalp Issues:**\n\n* Dandruff (dry or oily)\n* Fungal infection\n* Itching\n* Flaky or inflamed scalp\n\n# 🧴 SHAMPOO TYPES & CATEGORIES\n\n# 🔹 1.

Hard Water vs Soft Water\n\n# 🔹 Hard Water (contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Leaves behind mineral deposits on hair strands.\n   * Causes **dry, rough, dull, and brittle hair**.\n   * Can lead to **more hair breakage and tangling**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * **Clogs scalp pores**, leading to dandruff or scalp acne.\n   * May cause **itching or irritation**.\n   * Reduces the effectiveness of shampoo and conditioner (hair doesn’t feel clean).\n\n# 🔹 Soft Water (low mineral content):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Makes hair feel **softer and smoother**.\n   * Helps shampoos and conditioners work better.\n   * Prevents mineral buildup, making hair **shinier and more manageable**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * Gentle on the scalp.\n   * Helps maintain **natural oil balance**.\n\n# 🌡️ 2. Water Temperature\n\n* **Hot Water:**\n   * Strips natural oils from hair and scalp.\n   * Can cause **dryness, itching, and frizz**.\n   * May weaken hair roots over time.\n* **Cold or Lukewarm Water:**\n   * Retains natural oils.\n   * Helps **seal the hair cuticle**, making hair shinier and smoother.\n   * Best for the final rinse.\n\n# 🧪 3. Chlorinated Water (Swimming Pools)\n\n* Damages the hair shaft.\n* Causes **dryness, discoloration (especially in colored hair), and split ends**.\n* Irritates the scalp and worsens **scalp sensitivity or dandruff**.\n\n# ✅ Solutions if You Have Hard Water\n\n* Install a **shower filter** that removes minerals and chlorine. (or use filtered water from water purifier only for hair wash)\n* Use **chelating or clarifying shampoos** once a week (they remove mineral buildup).\n* Rinse with **apple cider vinegar + water (1:4 ratio)** to remove residue.\n* Apply **deep conditioning masks** to restore moisture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# # Is Finasteride Safe? Can You Take It Without Doctor Consultation?\n\n**Finasteride** (commonly used for male pattern baldness at **1 mg/day**) is generally **effective and relatively safe** when taken correctly - but **it should NOT be taken without a doctor’s consultation**, especially for long-term use.\n\n# 🔍 Why You Need Doctor Consultation\n\nFinasteride changes your **hormone levels** by reducing DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the hormone responsible for hair loss. Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it’s safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ✅ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**—though not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ⚠️ Common Side Effects (in 1–10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ⚠️ Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** – Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# 👨‍⚕️ Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# 🔍 Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely lowered)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#

Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C.

This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS.

When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al.

    "body": "\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article presents a comprehensive, patient-driven investigation into the efficacy of various topical agents in managing scalp psoriasis symptoms over a three-year period. Unlike traditional brand comparisons, the analysis isolates specific active ingredients found in over-the-counter and clinical treatments, assessing their impact through systematic self-experimentation. Key compounds evaluated include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, coal tar, selenium sulfide, piroctone olamine, tea tree oil, pine tar, bisabolol, and ketoconazole. The findings suggest that while many mainstream treatments offer limited or purely symptomatic relief, a combination of 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide provided a near-complete remission without adverse effects. The study also highlights the efficacy of zinc pyrithione and salicylic acid—despite their underrepresentation in psoriasis-specific treatment literature—and raises questions about overlooked ingredients that may offer genuine therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nI am a guy who has suffered from scalp psoriasis since my teenage years. For most of that time, I relied on coal tar shampoo, but in the past two to three years, I’ve conducted extensive self-experimentation driven by personal frustration and informed by scientific literature. I undertook this journey with a goal: to isolate which specific chemicals—not brands—actually alleviate symptoms of psoriasis. Having read many peer-reviewed articles and product studies over the years, I focused strictly on ingredients featured in scientific research, avoiding anecdotal claims and brand biases. This self-experimentation was documented carefully to avoid confounding variables, aiming to provide clarity for others who may feel unheard or misinformed about their treatment options.\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\nEach treatment was tested in chronological order. I maintained consistent hair care routines and avoided introducing multiple new ingredients simultaneously, ensuring any effects could be attributed to the active compound in question. Products were selected based on scientific literature or suggested efficacy in treating similar dermatological conditions like seborrheic dermatitis. Observations were made over a period of several weeks per compound, and effects were noted regarding itch relief, flake reduction, hair/scalp health, and need for adjunctive care like conditioner.\n\n\n\nFindings and Analysis:\n\n-2% Ketoconazole: Provided no noticeable improvement in symptoms.\n\n-0.5% to 1% Coal Tar: Relieved painful itching and significantly reduced dandruff and flaking, but some remained.\n\n-3% Salicylic Acid: Eliminated flakes and fully cleared symptoms.\n\n-1% Zinc Pyrithione: Cleared all symptoms and left hair smooth, but caused hair thinning.\n\n-Tea Tree Oil (approx. % unknown): Reduced flakes and psoriasis, but damaged follicles and increased itch without conditioner.\n\n-1% Selenium Sulfide: Marginally reduced symptoms but did not eliminate pain, itch, or flaking.\n\n-1% Piroctone Olamine: Slightly more effective than selenium sulfide but also mostly symptomatic.\n\n-1% Salicylic Acid + 1% Selenium Sulfide Combo: Fully effective; no symptoms, no hair damage, and no need for conditioner. This combination was found specifically in the Vichy Dercos Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, which also contains several other compounds that may have contributed to its superior effectiveness. Among them is tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), a known antioxidant which may also contribute anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, menthol is included, which I also noted helps prevent itchiness. The synergy of these ingredients may enhance its therapeutic profile.\n\n-Pine Tar (with Tea Tree Oil): Moderately effective, slightly better than tea tree oil alone, but difficult to isolate effects.\n\nSpecial Mentions:\n\n-Menthol: Provides significant itch relief and improves comfort.\n\n-Conditioner: Helps prevent scalp dryness, which can reduce flaking and itching when used with active treatments.\n\n-Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate): Acts as an antioxidant that protects scalp cells from oxidative stress and may offer additional anti-inflammatory support, potentially enhancing treatment effectiveness.\n\nPromising Untested Compounds:\n\n-Bisabolol: Not formally tested in this self-experimentation, but theorized to have potential due to its anti-inflammatory properties and scientific support in dermatological contexts.\n\n-Urea: Also untested directly in this study, but research shows highly promising effects in reducing scaling and inflammation in psoriasis, making it a strong candidate for future trials.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe results show a pattern of strong efficacy from salicylic acid and zinc pyrithione—both of which are rarely promoted as psoriasis treatments compared to coal tar. Coal tar and pine tar, although effective for itch, were less helpful in controlling flaking. Selenium sulfide and piroctone olamine offered symptomatic relief but no long-term benefit, suggesting their mechanism is more palliative than curative. Tea tree oil offered temporary improvements but presented drawbacks in hair follicle health. The combination of 1% salicylic acid with 1% selenium sulfide emerged as the most balanced and complete solution. Interestingly, ketoconazole, though widely recommended for scalp issues, had no effect on psoriasis, aligning with clinical skepticism about its use beyond fungal conditions. This study underscores the need for more ingredient-focused guidance in over-the-counter psoriasis treatments and suggests that compounds like salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, and possibly bisabolol, urea, and pine tar deserve more clinical attention.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThrough persistent, controlled self-experimentation over three years, I found that the most effective treatments for scalp psoriasis were not always the ones most commonly advertised. The best results came from 3% salicylic acid and 1% zinc pyrithione individually, and even more so from a combined 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide formula. This formula, found in Vichy Dercos, also contained tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E) and menthol, which likely contributed to its effectiveness by reducing inflammation and itchiness. These findings could serve as the basis for future controlled studies and provide a roadmap for other sufferers navigating treatment options.\n\n\n\nScientific References:\n\nSalicylic Acid: Lebwohl, 1999\n\nZinc Pyrithione: Kruglova et al., 2024\n\nCoal Tar: Slutsky et al., 2010\n\nSelenium Sulfide: van de Kerkhof & Franssen, 2001\n\nPiroctone Olamine: Lodén & Wessman, 2000\n\nTea Tree Oil: Summary\n\nPine Tar: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nBisabolol: Search\n\nUrea: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nMenthol: Prunel et al., 2012\n\nVitamin E: Cruz, 2013\n\nKetoconazole: Alford et al., 1986",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter seeing countless product recommendations and people experimenting with different brands, I realized that not everyone fully understands the logic behind a skincare routine for SD. Some people still think that they’ll buy a new cream and will forget about SD. This is not the case.\nBelow you can find the explanation of the routine so you can make your own based on the products available in your country. \nThe below list is a summary of Reddit info put into perspective.\n\n1. Malassezia Biofilm Disruption\n\nSD is caused by Malassezia overgrowth. It’s not a bacteria but fungi. This fungi is able to protect itself by creating a biofilm preventing from skin care products reaching it.\nBecause it’s not bacteria, there’s no point to use antibiotics for body and scalp.\n\n\t•\tXylitol: Disrupts biofilms and reduces microbial adhesion.\n\t•\tSalt Water/Dead Sea Salt: Osmotic effect helps break down biofilms and soothes inflammation.\n\t•\tVinegar: Acidity breaks biofilm layers and limits fungal growth.\n\t•\tBoric Acid: Acidic agent that disrupts biofilms and curbs Malassezia.\n\t•\tAzelaic Acid: Breaks biofilm, regulates oil, and reduces inflammation.\n\t•\tSalicylic Acid: Exfoliates and helps break biofilm layers while reducing oil buildup.\n\t•\tGlycolic Acid: Reduces buildup and enhances biofilm penetration.\n\n2. Anti-Inflammatory Agents\n\nIf your skin is swollen and red, you must stop inflammation and calm symptoms. If it’s not red, you can skip this step and go to the step 3.\nUse steroids only for short-term flare management. Always taper off gradually to avoid side effects.\n\n\t1.\tMild Potency (for sensitive areas):\n\t•\tHydrocortisone: Apply 1–2x daily for up to 2 weeks. Safe for face and sensitive areas.\n\n\t2.\tMedium Potency (for moderate inflammation):\n\t•\tLocoid (Hydrocortisone Butyrate): Apply 1–2x daily for 1–2 weeks. Ideal for thicker skin (scalp, trunk).\n\t•\tAlpicort: Apply 1x daily for 1 week.\n\n\t3.\tHigh Potency (for severe inflammation):\n\t•\tBelosalic: Combines betamethasone (anti-inflammatory) with salicylic acid (keratolytic). Use 1x daily for 1 week, then taper.\n\t•\tClobetasol: Reserved for severe cases. Apply 1x daily for a maximum of 1 week, then taper.\n\nNon-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents\n\n\t•\tTacrolimus: Modulates the immune response. Ideal for long-term use in sensitive areas like the face. Apply 1–2x daily as needed.\n\n3. Antifungal Agents (Killing Malassezia)\n\nThese target the fungal overgrowth directly and are essential after managing inflammation.\n\n\t•\tKetoconazole (Nizoral): Broad-spectrum antifungal that specifically targets Malassezia.\n\t•\tCiclopirox: Antifungal and anti-inflammatory, disrupting fungal cell membranes.\n\t•\tSelenium Sulfide: Reduces Malassezia activity and controls scalp oiliness.\n\t•\tDucray Kelual: Combines antifungal agents with soothing ingredients to reduce scaling and redness.\n\t•\tZinc pyrithione shampoos (skin cap, neutrogena, sebamed): Combine antifungal agents with soothing ingredients to reduce scaling and redness.\n\t•\tTea Tree Oil (diluted): Antifungal and antimicrobial, helps control Malassezia. Use with caution to avoid irritation.\n\t•\tSulfur Soap: Both antifungal and antibacterial; helps reduce oil production and flaking.\n\n4. Sebum Regulation and Skin Barrier Support\n\n\t•\tMCT Oil 8 (without lauric acid): Non-comedogenic moisturizer that doesn’t feed Malassezia.\n\t•\tSqualane Oil: Lightweight, non-comedogenic, and safe for Malassezia.\n\t•\tCeraVe PM Lotion: Contains ceramides and niacinamide; non-comedogenic and fungus-safe.\n\t•\tAvene Tolerance Emulsion: Minimal ingredients and suitable for sensitive, fungal-prone skin.\n\t•\tLa Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra: Lightweight, soothing, and free of oils that feed Malassezia.\n\n5. Vitamin and Mineral Support\n\nMake sure you are not vitamin deficient.\n\t•\tVitamin D3/K2 + Magnesium: Boosts skin immunity and reduces inflammation.\n•\tZinc: Helps regulate sebum production and provides anti-inflammatory benefits.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSD is not a condition like cold that disappears permanently with the help of one product. Malassezia is a natural part of your skin flora, and when your immunity drops, the fungi start to grow and SD returns. Therefore, your mistake is allowing it to grow. If you maintain an oil-free, slightly acidic environment on your scalp and skin, Malassezia won’t be able to thrive there.\n\nHope it helps",

    "body": "Hello guys,\n\nI just wanna share with you some information. Actually, I learned this last year, and I thought it would be selfish not to share it here since I learned so many things here in Reddit. So, please be open minded, this is my opinion, based on my researches (not only mine tho, mainly a very old guy from Switzerland who suffered from seb derm all his life).\n\nSo, to summarize the idea : Seb derm implies lots of flaky skin and dandruff. Researches have shown that scalps with dandruff had much higher level of histamine than healthy scalps.\n\n*Relationship between scalp histamine levels and dandruff within an Indian population: A confirmation study using LC/MS/MS method (*[*https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exd.14539*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exd.14539)*)*\n\n**When mast cells detect a substance that triggers an allergic reaction (an allergen), they release histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream**. Histamine makes the blood vessels expand and the surrounding skin itchy and swollen.\n\nSo, now let's look at the treatments.\n\nFirst, topical lithium is not useful against this \"fungi\" that everyone blames, but, it helps against seb derm.\n\n« Topical lithium succinate seems to improve facial seborrhoeic dermatitis strikingly but does not inhibit the growth of pityrosporum yeasts. Presumably it acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by some other mechanism. » [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1338980/pdf/bmjcred00215-0032a.pdf](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1338980/pdf/bmjcred00215-0032a.pdf)\n\nWhat about ketoconazole ? Everyone says here that it's a good anti fungal...actually, ketoconazole has anti-leukotriene properties, and remember mast cells releases \"other chemicals\" when facing an allergy, well they also release leukotriene.  (*Leukotrienes* are inflammatory chemicals the body releases after coming in contact with an allergen or *allergy* trigger).  .\n\nSo I do think that ketoconazole works because of its anti-leukotrien properties, not because it acts as an anti fungal. I think this is the same process with cicloprox olamine, and others anti-inflammatory chemicals that happen to work for seb derm. This can be great for many people, but this is not the healthiest solution.\n\nSo why people going to the beach have wonderful results ? and also ones using (only) diluted ACV ?\n\nSo, the hypothesis found by this Bernard Sudan is the following.\n\nThe mast cell cells of the skin certainly have their communication inhibited by simple water and thus react in the presence of allergens or environmental haptens by \"degranulating\" and thus releasing allergy mediators and the inflammation responsible for the redness and itching observed.\n\nOn the other hand, by applying a solution with high conductivity such as salted sea water or even a solution of diluted cider vinegar, one can observe an inhibition of the dermatitis and therefore of the inflammation.\n\nRemember that submarines communicate in sea water as well as whales and dolphins and that they would have some difficulty communicating in pure water… The problem is the same for tissue mast cells…\n\nOf course, reseaches would have to dig this idea, and find out the best way to maintain the best skin conductance for a healthy skin....but if the solution comes form the cheapest ingredient on earth, I don't think that big pharma will have any interest on this matter.\n\nPeace out !\n\nPS edit : from my personal experience, the only times I didn't usually have flaky and itchy skin  (since seb derm appeared) was on vacation at the beach, and I didn't use any shampoo on these times.\n\nWell, I also think that a healthy life style helps stabilize our mast cells...including D vitamin, magnesium, zinc and copper....holistic point of view is important.\n\nEDIT: So, seems like many people want to stick with this fungal idea...Well, you guys do whatever you want. I mean, it's not because an anti-fungal medicine worked, that the issue was fungal. And personally, I don't like this kind of short-term solutions...I don't wanna be attached to a pill all my life. So if this mast cells hypothesis is true, and salted water and diluted ACV can manage your seb derm, what do you have to loose ? Nothing, so be my guest, and try it.\n\nAnd again, if you try it, but also use many chemicals on your skin, you can't say that it doesn't work. Because you can find allergens in so many products nowadays. The same apply if you eat something you are allergic to...while doing the protocol...\n\nBtw, the author of the hypothesis, Bernard Sudan, was (is) allergic to nicotine. Me ? I have no idea what would be the allergen in my case. Seb derm appeared in my late 26's. There are so many environmental allergens, that my priority is to stabilize these mast cells, rather than finding the culprit. Otherwise, I would become paranoid and I value my peace of mind.\n\nedit : For some people, ACV or sea salt cannot be enough, well, there many people finding success with Selsun Blue or similar products, which all contain salt somehow (Selsun contains many kind of salt, including Selenium Sulfide, which is basically a special kind of salt....) So it would confirm the hypothesis...",

You should avoid inflammatory food like tomatoes, cause again they are high in histamine.

You still have to avoid food triggers but it can lessen reactions.

I wanted to share this with everyone and hope that someone out there finds it helpful. Love ya’ll ^~^\n\n(I found [folliculitisscout.com](https://folliculitisscout.com) to be a great database of seb derm safe products, not that only the ones with the green tick in the image are totally Sen derm safe)\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n\nTreatment/Routine:\nDo NOT use any oils or fatty alcohols except squalane oil, mct oil without lauric acid and mineral oil. Only these oils and a few essential oils like tea tree oil and Rosemary oil are seb derm safe. Refer to the science behind this in Research down below.\n\nScalp:\n- Aveda rosemary mint shampoo (clarifying shampoo that also contains white vinegar)\n- Selsun suspension shampoo (selenium sulfide 2.5%)\n- No conditioner\n- Comb through squalane oil from Biossance after washing for moisture\n\nUse the clarifying shampoo and selsun only once a week. Wash with clarifying shampoo first and then use selsun. This makes selsun work better as it penetrates the scalp better without all the buildup and dirt getting in the way.\n\nUse Giovanni tea tree shampoo every 2 days and wash twice as it’s really gentle. It contains mild sulfates that don’t strip moisture out your hair. Use very little product the second time.\n\nUse 1-2 drops of squalane oil\n\nFace:\n- Simple kind to skin refreshing face wash (gentle cleanser)\n- Sebamed clear face gel (moisturiser free from oils and fatty alcohols)\n- Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ (Only the one with the green cap is safe)\n\nDon’t use these right away if your just stating out:\n- Cosrx BHA Blackhead (salicylic acid toner comparable to the Paula’s choice bha 2% but Paula’s choice is not seb derm safe so go with this)\n- The ordinary niacinamide 10% \n\nWash my face twice a day with the cleanser and then moisturise. I apply sunscreen once in the morning everyday after moisturising.\n\nTwice a week, use  Cosrx bha and wait for it to dry before applying the moisturiser.\n\nDo not use niacinamide till after one day if you use Cosrx bha as it causes irritation.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nResearch:\nWhat I’ve found is that all oils like avocado oil, argan oil, coconut oil etc. and fatty alcohols like Cetyl alcohol, Streayl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol feed the Malassezia fungus which is the primary contributor to seb derm and dandruff. All these oils are recommended by skincare influencers for a healthy scalp and hair but don’t work those of us with seb derm.\n\nMost essential oils are also safe but I don’t recommend using anything except tea tree oil and Rosemary oil.\n\n[post pic change](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/set-of-hair-care-products-gm1012364510-272711404)\n\n[simple skincare science](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-malassezia-pityrosporum-routines/)\n\nYou can refer to the above link for a more detailed explanation but I’ll try my best to simplify it.\n\nSo malassezia feeds on compounds in between C-12 to C-24 carbon chain and the oils which are made from compounds outside this carbon chain are seb derm safe, they don’t feed the fungus and are the safe oils like squalane oil, mineral oil, mct oil without lauric acid. Lauric acid should be avoided as it’s formula is C-12:0 which feeds the fungus and makes seb derm worse.\n\nExample: \n[Coconut oil composition (composition and comparison paragraph)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_oil)\n\n[Composition (the info below)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044790/)\n\nCoconut oil is composed of the fatty acids, caprylic acid C-8:0 (8%), capric acid C-10:0 (7%), lauric acid C-12:0, (49%), myristic acid C-14:0(8%), palmitic acid C-16:0 (8%), stearic acid C-18:0 (2%), oleic acid C-18:1 (6%) and 2% of C-18:2 linoleic acid.\n\nHere all the compounds except caprylic C-8 and capric acid C-10 fall in C12 to C24 category so only these two are safe but only make up 15% of coconut oil together. Other compounds which make up the rest of the 85% fall in the C12 to C24 category so in conclusion coconut oil is unsafe.\n\nExample 2:\n[Tea tree oil (composition and characteristics)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_tree_oil)\n\nterpinen-4-ol\t35.0–48.0%\nγ-terpinene\t14–28%\nα-terpinene\t6.0–12.0%\n1,8-cineole\ttraces–10.0%\nterpinolene\t1.5–5.0%\nα-terpineol\t2.0–5.0%\nα-pinene\t1.0–4.0%\np-Cymene\t0.5–8.0%\nSabinene\ttraces–3.5%\nlimonene\t0.5–1.5%\naromadendrene\t0.2–3.0%\nledene\t0.1–3.0%\nglobulol\ttraces–1.0%\nviridiflorol\ttraces–1.0%\n\nNot a single compound is from C12 to C24 category hence it’s safe to use. Dilute this oil in squalane or mct oil before using.\n\nCheck all products for fatty alcohols and unsafe oils before buying them\n\n- - - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - - -\n\nFeel free to drop any questions/suggestions on how to improve this post down below. This is my first reddit post so any input is appreciated :)\n\nEdit: TLDR replaced some products which I found to be unsafe with completely seb derm safe alternatives.\n\n- Replaced Paula’s choice bha 2% with Cosrx bha as Paula’s choice is not seb derm safe :(\n- Replaced old sunscreen with new seb derm free one \n- Replaced the Giovanni tea tree oil shampoo with Pyunkang Yul low ph scalp shampoo as Giovanni contained Polysorbate 20 which was not seb derm safe :(\n- Replaced the Pantene lively clean shampoo with Aveda rosemary mint shampoo as Aveda is more gentle \n- Replace The Ordinary Squalane oil with Biossance as it is completely sugarcane based, broke out a little from the ordinary and found a report that The Ordinary sometimes sources Squalane from olives due to seasonal supply chain changes so stick with only sugarcane derived squalane as the squalane olive is unsafe",

        "body": "Story time:\n\nI’ve been suffering from seb derm on my scalp majorly and a tiny bit on my eyebrows and on the face ever since 8th grade. I’ve visited countless derms and high end clinics that prescribed everything from ketoconazole (nizoral) and coal tar shampoos to clobetasol propionate creams. At one point when I was 17 (2019) this derm misdiagnosed my condition as psoriasis and this was one of the darkest phases of my life as I thought that I had this incurable autoimmune disease that only had limited research on it. It’s really hard for a teenager to accept something like this especially when he’s a skinny kid with acne and had a lot of self esteem issues, topping it off with a shitload of dandruff flakes. \n\nAlternating between ketoconazole and coal tar shampoos worked for a while as long as I used them regularly until *drumbeats* 2020. During the covid lockdown my the internet and my mom suggested coconut oil (psoriasis people used it to find relief as far as I remember idk) which made EVERYTHING a lot worse, the shampoos and creams stopped working, my flakes were huge, yellow and oily af (I know ew). I was devastated and started searching for solutions desperately, this is when I found Reddit and many other people suffering from the SAME exact condition which my dumbass though was psoriasis (man I wanted to throw hands with that derm who misdiagnosed me). I started to read and understand more about seborrheic dermatitis and stopped using coconut oil. Tried all the solutions found on various subs like ACV rinse, tea tree oil, not washing your scalp much, washing your scalp way too much, sulfate free shampoos, co-washing and a million different products. \n\nNothing worked and I kept trying until early 2022 and I started my first year o uni, this is when I reverted back to ketoconazole buttttt life’s a bitch and it didn’t work that well anymore, probably due to the deep conditioner I was using at the time. I stopped using it and the flakes exploded like really bad. This was when my friend, who I met in uni and had the same condition as me, suggested this selsun shampoo which totally changed the game. He was using it since like 3 years (once a week) and apparently it never failed him, I found a YouTube video that also said the same thing. Boy he was right that shit is straight up liquid gold and smelled so good (sarcasm duh anything that works this good has to smell bad but I ain’t complaining). I was so so so fucking HAPPY man, literally flexed my clean scalp to all my friends. But wait it’s not all happy ending, lived flake free ever after yet. \n\nThing is selsun worked flawlessly but being a dumbass I wanted to fix my dry hair so I bought various conditioners and leave-in conditioners in late 2022 and the flakes came back a tiny bit and I freaked out but selsun took them way so I kept experimenting. I found out that I had curly hair which was low porosity after researching a bit on reddit, which meant that my hair had a hard time absorbing oils and products which left me with an oily scalp and dry hair. It was recommended on a few places in the curly hair community that people with low porosity hair should wash their hair like 2-3 times a week and use a clarifying shampoo once a week or they faced build up. I was curious cuz this build up may have caused my seb derm as I didn’t wash my hair properly and never used a clarifying shampoo. Shampoos with sulfates were also seen as better for low porosity hair as they removed build up better than sulfate free shampoos and I kept using sulfate free shampoos all this time cuz after 2010s with the rise of cgm sulfates were demonised and were seen as damaging to our hair and I believed the same. I found out that sulfates are actually good and at the same time made another breakthrough where I found out that all oils and fatty alcohols contributed to seb derm as they fed the fungus malassezia so stopped using them and voila I was right, flakes completely disappeared. I also stopped using Cetaphil moisturising lotion on my face as it contained avocado oil and boom clear was clear and the redness disappeared. \n\nThat my dear patient readers was how I wrapped up 2022, ending both the year and the long battle against seb derm. I feel a lot better these days, just good vibes and clear af skin and scalp. Something that I’ve learnt over these last few years is that every single problem has a solution, it’s up to us to find it! *flexes scalp lol*",

Rosemary oil is known to not only inhibit sebderm but also stimulate hair growth in general as it reduces DHT.

    "body": "I've had eczema my whole life, mostly manageable. But every time I slept with my long-distance partner, I experienced extreme flareups—without fail, within a day or two. This happened repeatedly, and the pattern was undeniable.\n\nThe assessments I received from dermatologists didn’t seem to account for the pattern I observed: \"it's a lifestyle / environment change\" (never been an issue), \"it's a contact allergy\" (don't have any), \"here's a steroid cream\" (sure).  \nI saw an immunologist who diagnosed me with \"spontaneous urticaria with angioedema\", key being *spontaneous* – \"it's stress\". He mentioned that similar cases are common among his patients and prescribed me with heroic doses of antihistamine as a first line, and an expensive immunotherapy treatment as a backup – both to \"reset my immune system\".\n\nI had been suggesting that my reaction might be triggered by an allergen on their skin—*Demodex* mites being the most likely candidate, given my well-documented allergy to dust mites (*Dermatophagoides*)¹. We had already ruled out contact allergies through patch testing and the elimination of all skincare products.  \nHowever, this idea was dismissed by all doctors I saw, citing the improbability of a common allergen remaining unidentified by the scientific and medical community. *Demodex* mites aren't part of the standard ALEX test.\n\nAgainst medical advice, I opted not to proceed with the high-dose antihistamine protocol prescribed and instead followed advice to treat *Demodex* from an [old forum thread](https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-girlfriend-is-allergic-to-something-around-or-about-me-please-help--453526): using a selenium sulfide-based shampoo and 4-terpineol-based eye wipes (both miticidal), along with an increased washing schedule for bedding.  \nThis approach proved surprisingly effective. I have not experienced any recurrence of the symptoms, at least not to any comparable extent, and my baseline scalp itch is gone too.  \nI had experienced a flareup of this scale only once in the past, which lasted for months. I was in a short-distance relationship at the time, so isolating their presence as a root cause wasn't obvious. The flareup did subside completely almost immediately after leaving for a trip without them, but I attributed that to a diet change – which probably also helped the baseline symptoms in the long term, but unlikely caused the flareup. The symptoms came back when I returned, to a smaller degree, but that relationship fizzled out soon after that for unrelated reasons.\n\nMost *Demodex*\\-related literature is found in ophthalmology (as a cause of blepharitis, which I experienced quite uncharacteristically during the flareup) and dermatology (as a cause of rosacea), whereas immunology research on *Demodex* appears surprisingly scarce.\n\nI also wonder whether the [treatments for staph](https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/15g6fui/everything_changed_when_i_started_treating_it_as/) that are popular in this community can have miticidal properties and whether there is some correlation between the effectiveness of the two. I considered whether my partner could have some staph strain I was reacting to, and trying the decolonization process, but it wasn't necessary in the end.\n\nDuring my research, I came across a recent treatise published in installments between 2020 and 2024, titled [*The Acari Hypothesis*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720322659#section-cited-by) which deals with the underlying causes of allergies. Installment (III) deals specifically with [Atopic Dermatitis](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/11/10/1083).  \nThe authors build on findings from [this highly cited paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3085643/), which established a correlation between tick bites and the sudden onset of red meat allergies. Given that mites cohabit human environments and feed on the same food sources, the authors hypothesize that allergic responses may result from the immune system misidentifying mite gastrointestinal secretions (which contain the allergen) as the parasite itself.  \nThey also extensively revisit the traditionally accepted role of hygiene in allergy development in [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/allergy/articles/10.3389/falgy.2024.1415124/full) (IV), which also contains extensive discussion of AD.\n\nI’m sharing this in case it helps others who, like me, struggled to find answers.\n\n─────────────────────────\n\n¹ I acknowledge that *Dermatophagoides* and *Demodex* belong to different orders and are not closely related. However, I found evidence of cross-reactivity between crustacean and mite allergies, due to exoskeletal proteins shared within the phylum *Arthropoda*. Additionally, given that *Demodex* is a parasite and *Dermatophagoides* a known allergen, and considering that the IgE response and mast cell activation underlying allergies and eczema is primarily an anti-parasitic mechanism, I felt this avenue was worth exploring further. There were also other indicators: the rashes seemed to expand from exposed areas, and in winter without stripping naked it would only affect my temples, eyes, hairline and neck, and my hands, only subsequently spreading to my chest. In summer I got a whole body rash, including my legs; I thought I had scarlet fever. None of these were common areas for me to have eczema.",

        "body": "Great insight. Your experience aligns closely with cases where flareups involve both an IgA-driven reaction against Demodex and an underlying/ongoing IgG response to staph bacteria. Often, these two immune responses coexist and amplify each other, contributing significantly to symptom severity. Helping your body process histamine can noticeably improve symptoms, but that approach doesn’t fully address the root cause—which, in many instances, is bacterial overgrowth driving or complicating the immune response in general or to mites specifically.",

That takes a lot of mental energy and persistence — especially when you’re already flaring and vulnerable.\n\nI’m super curious about the selenium sulfide and 4-terpineol combo — do you use them preventatively now, or only when things start to flare again? Also, did you ever try topical anti-inflammatories during the process, or did the mite-focused routine alone resolve everything?\n\nI’ve been exploring **steroid-free herbal alternatives** rooted in TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), and your post actually gave me some new ideas on why **some plant-based balms work better than expected** — maybe it’s not just anti-inflammation but **antimicrobial or even anti-mite** effects.\n\nSeriously though, this is one of the most thought-provoking posts I’ve read in the eczema space.

I've tried all of internet \"cures\", I have the prescription lotions, and even had one batch of the ketocanozole pills. Nothing worked and I basically gave up. It had become huge patches all over my back, sides, stomach, arms and legs, and blotchy patches all around my genitals. It had been that way for probably 10 years but luckily it was all easily concealed by clothing. Out of site, out of mind, I guess. It wasn't until this year that it finally started creeping up my neck and further down my arms.\n\n\nI decided to try again and I was absolutely shocked that it worked this time! Here is what I did:\nI got one of those loofas and a brush on a stick thing and prepared to do a DEEP clean on my entire body. I used a better smelling dandruff shampoo with pyrithione zinc and scrubbed every inch of my body. Twice. And I mean SCRUBBED! My thinking was that the more oil, dirt, and dead skin I could scrape err... exfoliate off of my body, the more selsun blue I could absorb. I don't know if it matters, but it's what I did!\n\n\nAfter I had sufficiently removed my top layer of skin, I thoroughly rinsed and began to lather on the Selsun Blue 1% selenium sulfide. The first layer I pretty much covered my entire body and tried to rub it in as well as I could. Then I went back over all of the problem areas and put 2 more layers on. And I put it on THICK. Like, Blue Man Group auditions thick.\n\n\nOnce I was covered, I put on a long sleeve shirt, pajama pants, and popped a couple benadryl to hopefully ensure I could stay asleep in case the stuff got itchy. This was on a Friday night and I slept in as long as I could. Got about 12 hours of sleep and then hopped back in the shower. I used the loofa and the dandruff shampoo again and scrubbed all of the blue off and waited.\n\n\nTwo days later is when I first noticed it was working. I work outdoors, and the huge patches on my arms turn dark red when I get hot. I'm pretty concious about it for obvious reasons, although it had long since become the norm. Well on this particular day the LACK of dark red is actually what caught my eye and I realized it was finally working!! I can not even describe how happy I am, and my confidence is already going up.\n\n\nI plan to do that procedure 2 more times about 2 weeks apart, but this first dose has already made a HUGE improvement.\nIf you're still reading this, then you likely have dealt with TV and I can't recommend trying this out enough!

I used to struggle with this a lot during puberty, mostly because I didn’t know how to properly care for my bras or how to take care of my chest. Medication or treatment can help clear things up, but if you don’t change the habits that cause it, the infection will just come back.\n\nTinea versicolor is a kind of irritation is a fungal or yeast infection caused by moisture getting trapped. The breasts are an area that’s especially prone to this if you have larger breast or chest tissue. Here's what helped me:\n\n**1. Keep the area dry:**  \nAfter showers, swimming, or a sweaty day, make sure to fully dry underneath your breasts. Even a little leftover moisture can cause problems.\n\n**2. Wash your bras regularly:**  \nIdeally, wash your bra every 2–3 wears. If you get very sweaty, wash it after each use. Dirty bras can trap sweat, oils, and bacteria, which feed the fungus and make it spread faster.\n\n**3. Let your chest breathe:**  \nWhenever you don’t need to wear a bra, give your skin a break. Bras trap heat and moisture, especially if they’re tight or padded.\n\n**4. Choose breathable bras:**  \nPadded bras hold onto moisture the most and take longer to dry. I recommend switching to unlined fabric bras or, if you need more structure, molded bras. These are lighter and allow for better airflow.\n\n**5. Change bras if wearing them all day:**  \nIf you’re wearing a bra for long hours (or even all day), change into a clean one when you get home to avoid sitting in a damp, sweaty bra.\n\n  \nI hope this helps, especially for those new to the life of having breasts.",

I've lived with my husband for 4 years and I've never experienced this issue. \nWe moved to Louisville,KY in July last year and within a month there was this HORRENDOUS smell in the bathroom. The only thing I can compare it to is chemicals. Almost like when you go to a salon and there is a perm being done. \nThe apartment was terrible so I thought it was just something about the apartment. We broke the lease and moved to a new a place because of how terrible it was there. \nWe've been in our new place since January and I started noticing the smell in there again! And it's only in our main bathroom! The bathroom in the nursery does not have this smell and it gets used just as frequently. We bathe the baby there daily and we cloth diapers so the spray the diapers in there everyday but this smell is not there...only mine and my husband's bathroom. And it's not anywhere else in the house. \nWe do have 2 dogs and my husband thought maybe they had an accident on the rug but I've washed and bleached it twice now and even while it's out of the room post mop the smell is still there. \n\nAny ideas on what it is so I can clean it?\n\n\nUPDATE: GUYS I FIGURED IT OUT . \n\nI have seborrheic dermatitis and I started a new shampoo recently. The main ingredient is SELENIUM SULFIDE. Which is why it was similar to the drain smell someone mentioned that happens because of hydrogen sulfide and the hydrogen sulfide is probably what was happening in my old apartment. And why it smelled similar to the perms because ammonia and sulfide smell similar. 🙃\nI dropped it a few days ago and the top broke off and you know shampoo bottles always get a little soap residue under them.\nI was scrubbing my tub after I posted this and I picked it up and caught a smell of it. I was like \"wait a minute\" and looked at the back 😂\nI assume it's because I haven't been able to close the bottle and I don't wash my hair everyday so I haven't picked up the bottle since the lid broke.",

    "body": "**The post below has been edited and improved.**\n\n**I recommend you read all of this, however, a general recommendation 'TLDR' will be at the bottom. My issue was primarily the scalp/nose/beard, however, this applies to general SerbDerm. Below is a mixture of long-term and short-term protocols that will benefit both men and women.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Regarding lifestyle changes (long-term):***\n\n* Get a health check. Get a vitamin/mineral check, see if you have any deficiencies. Get an allergy test, see if you have any allergies. If you want to go above and beyond, one can get a gut microbiome test, etc. If you don't want to do any of this, aim for general health with healthy foods, and experiment with what foods affect you.\n* Optimize your sex hormone (Testosterone for men/Estrogen for women), optimize all of the following: thyroid health, immune system, lymphatic system, vitamins/minerals, and regulate gut health. These are very important, and too in-depth for me to go into here. Alot of the information is available online. But to start you off, probiotics/prebiotics (gut health), Zinc, Iodine, Vitamin D/C/E/K, etc, are all going to play a role in optimizing these systems. Zinc, especially, has been known to help leaky gut. Remember, 70%+ of immune system cells are in the gut.\n* Start Aerobic exercises. Walk everyday, 7 days a week, 10,000 steps daily is considered optimal. Pick a cardio protocol and aim for 2-3 days a week for 30 mins to 1 hour (jogging, swimming, biking, etc). This is good for cardiovascular conditioning and the lymphatic system.\n* Start Anaerobic exercises. For example, do either weight-lifting, HIIT, athletic/explosive training, etc. Weight-lifting/Athletic training can be done 2-6 days a week, depending on routine. HIIT is recommended 2-3 times a week. Pick 1-3 you enjoy. For reference, I do weight-lifting/athletic training 6 days a week, and HIIT 2 times a week.\n* I found a connection with my Serb Derm and a supposed mild form of Cholinergic Urticaria. It's a chronic condition caused by an increase in body temperature, sweating, etc. This may or may not be the case for you. But, to fix this, I try to avoid \"hot environments/conditions\" as much as possible. Meaning, I avoid wearing too much clothing (which causes body temperature to rise), avoid/limit hot beverages, avoid staying in the sun for multiple hours at once (take breaks), moderately ease into training/exercise to avoid a trigger, etc.\n* Get daily sunlight exposure (body/face/scalp). Avoid 11am-1pm sun exposure, as it is strongest. I personally go outside in the morning for 30min-1hr of sunlight, this varies based on your melanin. Don't overdo it, as it may trigger the opposite effect of what you want. But, this is good for Vitamin D levels and general health, circadian rhythm, etc.\n* Get quality sleep. 7-9 hours each night. (best time to sleep is 10pm ish for HGH hormone, etc). Sleep in complete darkness. Optimize temperature (between 15-19 degrees celsius). Remove/turn off electronic devices from your vicinity (if you need it for alarms, use aeroplane mode).\n* Avoid being sedentary as much as possible. Keep moving, this is optimal for the lymphatic system and overall health.\n* Adopt better breathing (nasal breathing). I recommend Wim Hof for this process.\n* Adapt to the cold as best as you can. I also recommend Wim Hof for this process. Also, when showering, either use lukewarm or cold water (never hot), and preferably end your shower with a 60sec cold shower rinse off.\n* Control/reduce stress and learn meditation (5-20mins daily).\n* Intermittent Fasting. This improves gut health, and is optimal for glycemic index, etc. Space out your foods more, and eat less. I completely avoid breakfast now.\n* Don't over-wash, and don't under-wash, both can cause oily scalp or dry scalp issues. Find the right spacing that fits you. For me, every-day or every second-day works best. You want to try to reduce your scalp from producing too much of an oily scalp (sebaceous glands).\n* Change your mindset. I know this sounds pseudo, but it's important to manifest positive energy into your life to improve internally. There are studies on this. Constant negative thinking/mental health can inhibit HGH, testosterone (for males), and raise hormones such as cortisol, etc, which create hormonal imbalances that trigger autoimmune conditions. Plenty of studies also verify the placebo effect. You have to believe you're healing.\n* Avoid general internal and external inflammation and aim for homeostasis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Regarding diet (long-term):***\n\n* Avoid/limit processed foods, sugar, saturated/trans fat, gluten, vegetable oils, caffeine, alcohol, soft-drinks, fried foods, processed meats, refined baked goods, etc. (the traditional stuff). This isn't to say you can never have any of the above, or that they'll ALL personally affect you. These are just categories known to cause inflammation and aggravate skin conditions.\n* Avoid/limit Histamine foods, Lectin foods, Nightshade foods, Phytic Acid foods, etc. (all known to be sensitive to the Gut).\n* Avoid any traditional foods that trigger an allergic response (intolerances), such as nuts, dairy, etc. I personally have done a trial and error, and can eat foods like eggs and nuts, but you have to experiment for yourself.\n* Experiment with diets. Try the carnivore diet, try the keto diet, try the elimination diet, etc. See which gives you the best gains.\n* Keep in mind, you want lots of fiber. Fiber is essential for gut health (prebiotics).\n* Make sure you're getting a balanced intake of nutrient dense foods, filled with a variety of Vitamins and Minerals. An example of this would be having a balanced Omega 3:6 ratio. Most people have an insufficient ratio of Omega 3 (fish, etc), and surplus of Omega 6 (chicken, etc), which contributes to inflammation in the body. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***My diet (long-term):***\n\n* Personally, I work best with chicken/fish/eggs, a selection between either sardines/mackarel/herrings, chicken, as well as eggs as my primary protein sources for lunch and dinner. Red meat and beef liver is a secondary source that is eaten occasionally *(some people may benefit avoiding red meat)*. Usually, these are eaten either with white rice (1 cup), alongside vegetables, or both. I cook my foods with olive oil. Both olive oil and coconut oil are considered optimal.\n* I incorporate a variety of fruits and vegetables (e.g. Kale, Kiwi Fruit, Berries, Carrots, etc). For snacks, sometimes I cycle between seeds and/or nuts (pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, pistachios, walnuts, almonds), however one must be cautious of phytic acid (antinutrients) before doing so. To prevent this, mix nuts/seeds with filtered water, add 1-2 tablespoons of unrefined salt, leave it overnight or 7 hours ish, and then rinse/dry. Or, if this is too much effort, buy them sprouted as I do. The process is already done.\n* I also try to include superfoods like garlic, honey, ginger, tumeric, and onions daily for gut health and testosterone. Do what works for you, there's plenty of substitutes out there.\n* My eating schedule is lunch/dinner, and a snack period (fruits/vegetables/nuts/seeds). 3 eating periods that are spaced out.\n* Remember, this won't necessarily be 100% optimal for you, it's a template.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Regarding Supplementation/Intake (do as much as you can) (long-term):***\n\n* I take daily Sea Moss (1-2 Tablespoons). Great for optimizing your vitamin/mineral intake.\n* I cycle Bone Broth/Kefir/Sauerkraut daily or every second day. You can choose a natural probiotic you enjoy. Great for optimizing your gut health.\n* 1-2 tsp of Black Seed Oil. Great for overall health.\n* 1 tbsp cycled between Olive Oil or Coconut Oil each day. Great for overall health.\n* I eat green bananas, garlic, onions, etc as my general prebiotics. Great for optimizing gut health.\n* Drink lots of water, perhaps purchase a large 2-3L water bottle to help remind you, preferably filtered.\n* You can also try taking probiotic capsules instead, primarily focused for the gut/skin. Lactobacillus paracasei ST11 was known to have a direct benefit towards Serb Derm, not something I've personally tried though. I prefer the natural methods.\n* Some people may also benefit from drinking 1 tablespoon of ACV or 1 tablespoon of C8 MCT Oil as well, known to support gut health too. You don't need to supplement all of the above. Simply utilize what is easiest for you to access/purchase/prepare. The general idea is having a good probiotic source, prebiotic source, and multi-vitamin/mineral source.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Regarding Topicals (pick one of the following for maintenance) (short/long-term maintenance):***\n\n1. C8 MCT Oil (3-4 tablespoons), and rub it thoroughly on scalp/face/beard 1-2x a week. Leave it on for as long as possible (1-6 hours ish), and wash it off in the shower. **(best option imo)**\n2. Squalane Oil (3-4 tablespoons) is also known to help, if C8 MCT Oil didn't work out for you.\n3. Dead Sea Salt  (½ tsp Mineral Dead Sea Salt/2 cups of warm water), although, you can increase the Dead Sea Salt ratio if you feel it's too little.\n4. Honey Mask. (Raw Honey/Manuka Honey). You can apply this directly or dilute it 1:1 with water.\n5. Regarding traditional \"topicals\", you can try Nizoral, Selsun, T/Gel, etc, if you're waiting in the meantime or the above does not work. I found these helped short-term, but were terrible long-term decisions, and ultimately stopped working after some time. **(worst option imo)**\n\nI personally use a self-made formula, which is C8 MCT Oil (3-4 tablespoons) mixed with 30-45 drops of Rosemary Oil. You don't need Rosemary Oil, I simply add this for hair growth/thickness purposes, which might help people who have experienced thinning due to Serb Derm. However, it might be better for you to try the C8 MCT Oil on its own first. I only need to use this protocol 1x a week before showering to remove any potential oil/product buildup + keeping my scalp regulated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Regarding Hair/Scalp/Face (long-term):***\n\n* Make sure you find the right shampoo/conditioner, etc, for your scalp and hair type. You can do this by finding out your hair texture, hair porosity, etc, to evaluate what's best for you. For curly-haired people like me, you can try the CG Method, available online and on Reddit. Alot of this is trial and error. Some people will benefit from a PH Balancing Shampoo and/or a Shampoo without Sulfates/Silicones/Parabens. Others won't be affected as much, and can opt a more versatile route. It's important you find a good protocol for long-term usage that works for you. \n* If you have a beard, adopt proper beard wash/conditioner/oil routine. Utilize beard wash/conditioner 3x a week, and beard oil 4-7x a week.\n* For the face, you should primarily wash with cold water, and everyday/every other day, use a good cleanser/moisturizer that is natural and beneficial for the skin. A good example is Black African Soap, which I personally use. Don't overcomplicate it. Water intake will do most of the job. Just find one that works for you.\n* Use a Scalp/Hair Oil to keep the scalp moisturized/regulated. An example of this would be the 'Nourish Skin & Hair Serum'.\n* Avoid using too much hair products, which could increase oil production. Or the very least, avoid getting it on your scalp. This issue is primarily tailored towards people with curly hair who need more hair products.\n* Make sure the ingredients somewhat comply with either of the following websites:  \n[https://sezia.co/](https://sezia.co/)   \n[https://folliculitisscout.com/](https://folliculitisscout.com/)   \n[https://skinsort.com/fungal-acne-checker](https://skinsort.com/fungal-acne-checker)   \nWhy do I say \"somewhat\"? Here is why. My shampoo selection (Black Castor Oil) actually gets flagged under the website 'sezia' for three ingredients, but doesn't get flagged on the 'skinsort' website. The problem is, alot of shampoos/conditioners, even ones marked as 'anti-dandruff', have ingredients that potentially promote the growth of Malassezia. But, either the 'active ingredient', often times pyrithione zinc, ketoconazole, etc, cancels out the ingredients, or the ingredient itself isn't strong enough to cause issues. This is why I say it's primarily trial and error. My weekly C8 MCT Oil topical rinse is enough to keep me clear, despite the usage of my shampoo, so it works for me. As long as the product is generally clear on all three websites, it should be okay for usage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***EXTRAS:***\n\n* A scalp massager was known to help some people in the shower, helped me a little too.\n* If you live in a 'hard-water' area, I'd suggest getting a 'hard-water' filter. This has been known to fix eczema related issues. Soft water is optimal for the skin.\n* These are some good reads, if you haven't already:  \n[https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/)  \n[https://sebdermhealing.com/](https://sebdermhealing.com/)  \n[https://www.dandruffdeconstructed.com/](https://www.dandruffdeconstructed.com/)\n* If all the above doesn't work, there is a general regime known as:\n\n1. Tackle the biofilm\n2. Kill the fungus/yeast\n3. Replenish skin barrier\n\nThis protocol was known to help many people. You can try this if you find the general topical regime I've given hasn't worked out for you after a few weeks/months. An example protocol of this would be:\n\n1. White Vinegar (5%) or Xylitol (5%) or Selenium Sulfide (5%) (disrupt biofilm).\n2. 3-4 tablespoons of MCT C8 Oil (kill fungus).\n3. Scalp Treatment, glycerol-containing leave-on, products with Ceramides. Make sure to avoid any products that feed malassezia. (Replenish skin barrier).\n\nYou apply either Xylitol 5%/White Vinegar 5%/Selenium Sulfide 5% to your scalp. It needs to be diluted, something around the ratio of 2-4 tablespoons and 1-2 cups distilled or filtered water should work. Apply the mixture to your scalp and leave it on for 5-20mins. Rinse it all off in bathroom sink and dry your scalp. Then apply 3-4 tablespoons of C8 MCT Oil to your scalp. Keep this applied for 1-6 hours (however long you can), then start your actual shower. Do this as normal. Then after your shower, once your scalp and hair is all dried, you apply your designated cream to replenish the skin barrier. Do this protocol for 1-2 weeks, and then try simply utilizing C8 MCT Oil (1-2x a week) for maintenance/prevention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* Optimize your sex hormone (Testosterone for men/Estrogen for women), optimize thyroid health/immune system/lymphatic system, optimize vitamins/minerals, and regulate gut health. Avoid allergies/food intolerances.\n* Use a good topical for maintenance. I use C8 MCT Oil (3-4 tablespoons) and rub it thoroughly on my scalp 1x a week. Leave it on for as long as possible (1-6 hours ish), and wash it off in the shower.\n* Exercise both Aerobic and Anaerobic. Don't be sedentary. Keep moving.\n* Avoid processed foods, refined carbs, sugar, and foods that disrupt optimal gut health. Opt for good protein/healthy fats/complex carbs intake. 70%+ of immune system cells are in the gut.\n* Get optimal sunlight exposure, sleep time/quality, and water intake.\n* Adapt and become comfortable to the \"cold\", and avoid certain \"heat conditions/beverages/foods\".\n* Reduce stress, improve nasal breathing, and meditate.\n* Change mindset. Become mentally positive to promote optimal hormonal balance.\n* Fasting/Intermittent Fasting.\n* Try the 3 step 'disrupt biofilm', 'kill fungus', 'replenish skin barrier' protocol if the above topicals don't work. This is available in the 'Extras' section.\n\n  \nI hope some of this helps. Some of this might just be general advice to most of you, but it's the best I can do lol. Even if just one person heals from it or experiences an improvement, it wouldn't have been a waste of time for me. Remember, it's not expected to fulfill all of the above instantly. It takes time and discipline. Slowly work towards optimizing all of the above for an overall better life.\n\nThis is all primarily internal. You have to heal the internal system to see long-term benefits externally. Topicals, steroids, etc are all short-term maintenance solutions to keep you going back to your Dermatologist, not the permanent cure. Do not expect a magical solution any time soon, we fund the Pharmaceutical Industries. All these conditions are a byproduct of the foods/lifestyles created/promoted in our society, especially the West. Do your best to optimize your health, and you'll reap the benefits forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodluck everyone! And feel free to ask any questions.",

    "body": "*Background:*\n\nHi beautiful people blessed by SebDerm! I have been severely struggling with the condition since I'm 13. Now, I'm 33 and finally got this beast tamed and under control. Quick story, I originally struggled by not even knowing what I had as far as uncontrollable flaking on my face and scalp that would randomly come and go during my teens. I was bullied because of it. I was told I was a dirty person because I didn't wash my face or hair, even though I did. It was devastating. My mother made me see a dermatologist, but I don't believe she diagnosed me properly and all the prescriptions she gave me never worked. During those 20 years, I struggled juggling between different products and exfoliating routines. Some products helped more than others (I actually tried several recommended on this subreddit and I am grateful for the community) but no matter what, flare-ups would always come back and haunt me for weeks at a time. It sometimes got so bad that my face would be covered in tough flakes leaving my skin underneath raw, red, and terribly painful when exfoliated. I believe SebDerm partially contributed to hair loss around my hairline as it was there that my flaking was the worse (I am now controlling that with Finasteride and it's working great). I was also scratching my hair and face all the time, and picking up scabs and flakes regularly. It looked like I had a tick, as the picking tended to get worse the more stressed I was. I even have, as a male, used foundation to cover my redness when going on dates or when it was really bad. It was mentally distressing and truly depressed me. I felt that it would be this way forever.  Now though! I know for certain that it wasn't a tick but only because of SebDerm as I haven't had the urge to scratch for a few months (never happened before). My life completely changed and I'm a new man! So here is me sharing with you what helped me, wishing to give back to the community, and hoping it helps at least some of you with a similar condition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Products*:\n\nI used everything from natural remedies to over-the-counter prescriptions and everything in between, and I am so relieved to tell you that the products I settled with are cheap, very easy to find, and go a long way.  Brand choice is your preference, the only thing important are the active ingredients and concentration.\n\n\\- Salicylic Acid shampoo (3%)\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide shampoo (2.5%, 1% is ok just leave-in a little longer)\n\n\\- Ketaconazole shampoo (1% concentration, more will melt your face off)\n\n\\- Coconut Oil (no need for MCT or fancy stuff, as long as it's natural, in clear liquid form, and not rancid you'll be fine)\n\nTHAT'S IT!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Routine*:\n\n\\- Nice and hot shower.\n\n\\- Apply the Salicylic Acid shampoo on your hair and face (if you have a beard like me, make sure you apply liberally on it too) and behind the ears. Exfoliate face with a gentle cloth. Rinse.\n\n\\- Apply the Selenium Sulfide shampoo similarly. Let it soak in for 20 seconds or the time it takes for you to body wash. Rinse.\n\n\\- Apply the Ketaconazole Shampoo similarly (don't leave it longer than 20 seconds, it will burn your skin). Rinse very well.\n\n\\- Dry up, and head over to the bathroom sink. (Shave if needed) Then, pour cold water from the faucet onto your palms and apply it to your face to firm up your skin and close your pores. Clean towel dry your face with gentle blotting.\n\n\\- Apply a small quantity of Coconut Oi, on the face and hairline. I use a small squirt bottle that I filled with coconut oil to make things easier. Three to four drops top. A little goes a long way.\n\n\\- Repeat every day for the first week, then every other day the second week. And after a month, you'd want to maintain by at least twice a week. By then, you can actually go a full week without any of the shampoos above, perfect for going on trips and not needing to bring your arsenal with you!\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOLKS!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried all kinds of moisturizers and fancy medical stuff on my face, all to find that it never really helped and would end up caking-up later and making the flaking even more challenging. I had actually learned from this sub that Malassezia feasts on organic oils, and so I took the advice and avoided using any natural oil to moisturize. That was a mistake, Coconut Oil in particular turned out to be a godsend! It keeps my face perfectly moisturized, smells great, and keeps the SebDerm at bay.\n\nNow, I recognize that this sounds pretty basic and you probably have already tried some of those products already without much success, but maybe give this routine a try in this exact same way, and it might help you just as much as it helped me!\n\nI also welcome and encourage other people to chime in and let me and others know their suggestions for any improvements.\n\nSeriously guys, don't despair. Our condition might not be curable, but it can certainly be controllable, and we can keep all the symptoms dormant once we find a routine that works.\n\nGood luck on your journey and best wishes for smooth and healthy skin!\n\n*TLDR:*\n\nShower daily with Salicylic Acid shampoo + Selenium Sulfide shampoo + Ketaconazole shampoo on hair and face. Then moisturize with Coconut Oil. Enjoy smooth skin!",

    "body": "# What is seborrheic dermatitis?\n\nIt is a red, itchy, scaly, flaky rash that I commonly found on the scalp, or nose and surrounds. It looks similar to eczema or other dermatitis conditions. [Here](https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/8387285_f260.jpg) is an image of what a mild-serious case may look like.\n\n# What causes seborrheic dermatitis?\n\nNobody really knows, however it is believed to be an inflammatory reaction to high amounts of Malassezia yeast. As with many skin conditions lots of factors can inflame this condition; alcohol, stress, drug use, poor hygiene, cold/dry weather, and other medication.\n\n# Treatments\n\nI'm going to list what I tried and how it worked for me - please note that this doesn't mean they will/won't work for you, different things work for different people.\n\n**Clotrimazole**\n\nWhen I was told it was a fungal issue I used this OTC anti-fungal. It did nothing. Might have made it worse. I've since learned that ketocanozole is typically recommended but I did not try this. Zinc pyrithione and selenium sulfide may also be used.\n\n\n**Keratolytics**\n\nI used clearasil pads that have salicylic acid (2.0%) in them. This helped remove the scaly skin but did not solve the issue at all. Tried the pimple cream too but that's also just salicylic acid so same results.\n\n**Benzoyl Peroxide**\n\nThis is an acne treatment cream. I thought it might work. It made the skin more dry but did reduce the redness. So yeah don't do this.\n\n**Salt baths**\n\nThis worked surprisingly well. By washing my face thoroughly with warm water, than mixing in a tablespoon of salt into warm water and washing my face with that for a couple minutes, and then washing with cold to close the pores I saw a reduction in redness and less scaly skin. However, it's salt. Shit dries out your entire face and makes it feel tight.\n\n**Hydrocortisone**\n\nWorked magic. Applied in the morning, applied at night. Woke up with a clear face. Legitimately the best treatment I tried. A 1% cream is OTC so you do not need to see a doctor. This is my recommended treatment.\n\n# Moisturizers\n\nOne issue with this type of skin condition is that it causes dry skin, so you want to moisturize, however a lot of moisturizers contain oils that will cause the condition to flare up, leaving you with even more dry skin.\n\nYou need to look for a moisturizer without oil if possible. Glycol, glycerine, mineral oils, and vegtable oils (sometimes listed as an acid) are all very common in moisturizers, even the 'all natural' ones because these are natural ingredients. Avoid them. \n\nDimethicone will not do well with your skin as it traps moisture in, but accelerated fungus growth. On the other hand parabens can help your skin, despite being quite harsh.\n\nShop around and find what works.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis is just my experience, and is not a conclusive guide by any stretch. Hopefully this can help someone out there fix their skin!",

        "body": "I'm glad you found something that works for you! I have also had seborrheic dermatitis. The flaky skin appeared between my eyebrows and research led me to believe it was weird dandruff. I tried so many things before seeing a doctor. VERY aggressive BHA usage (OTC salicylic acid) since it seemed to work for a moment, dandruff shampoo, exfoliation, more moisturizer, no moisturizer. None of them did anything for me, at least nothing that would last all day.\n\nI finally went to a dermatologist and was diagnosed because the skin between my eyebrows was visibly damaged. I got brown spots from all of my poor skincare habits trying to treat it and was getting wrinkles before I was 20. He gave me a prescription for Xolegel, an anti-fungal and told me he'd give me a stronger bottle if it didn't work after a few weeks. The doctor also gave me a very, very small hydrocortisone cream and said to use it only if I really had something important coming and it flared up. You can't use it too much or it will damage your skin further. Naturally, went home and used the cortisone so I could remember my face without this problem, and then started the Xolegel once it was clear.\n\nI never finished the whole bottle of Xolegel I got after diligently using it for 3 months or so, but a few years later it hasn't returned. If it does flare up again one day, I will go get a fresh bottle from the derm rather than bothering to self-treat because it was just so much easier.\n\nI would recommend anyone else who reads this and believes they might have Seb derm go to a dermatologist if they are able. Hydrocortisone can be an \"out of the frying pan and into the fire\" experience for some people by thinning the skin, causing premature aging, etc.",

    "body": "Dear r/SebDerm\n\n(If this post gets more than 20 upvotes, I will post pictures.  Hope this helps people.)\n\nThis is Day 1 of Treatment - I will be sharing my journey on this subreddit for those inclined.  \n\nI am a 22 years old male - living in very cold weather.  I like spicy foods - I have a high body fat percentage - sue me. \n\n**Background**\n\nI have suffered SebDerm for roughly 5-6 years now.  I was prescribed **Mometasone Fuorate** by my GP, and to my horror, I used this steroidal ointment for longer than prescribed.  Eventually, I decided to stop using the ointment as I was scared this would cause permanent damage to my skin, which it seems to have already done - but I'm really not sure about this - may visit a derm to assess. \n\nAnyways, down to the good stuff.  \n\n**My SebDerm locations (redness scale 1 - 10):** \n\n\\- nasal folds (10) \n\n\\- front of nose itself (10)\n\n\\- a small circular patch just to right of the bridge of my nose (10)\n\n\\- a big circular patch on the right side of my face (10)\n\n\\- under both my ears (5)\n\n\\- a thin linear patch on my hairline (which I'm ignoring for now - don't feel like experimenting with new products on my hairline for risk of hair-loss, which I have definitely had quite a lot of these past 2 years) (3)\n\n\\- (possibly) under my left armpit (10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Treatment Journey Day 1 (will continuously edit)**\n\nLast night I ran a quick test, nothing full-blown:\n\nI diluted white vinegar (**acetic acid** is supposed to disrupt the **biofilm** that is created by the Malassezia yeast, resulting in a rough like texture of the skin) with a ratio of 1:4 and applied it to my red nose and side of my face using a Q-Tip (and not using my fingers).  After 30-60 seconds, I rinsed off - applied Squalane oil as a moisturiser and went to bed.  The next morning (today), I woke up and the redness had gone down to a 6 (from 10) but not entirely.  The skin still felt rough.  \n\nBefore my shower, I repeated the Vinegar routine, waited 30-60 seconds, and then hopped into the shower.  I cleansed my face with water -> rubbed **Vanicream Zinc Pyrithione 2% barsoap** all over my face and under my armpits and rinsed -> followed with **Clinical Strength H&S Selenium Sulfide** shampoo on both my face and my scalp -> followed with the a biotin conditioner, so as to not completely dry out my hair.  \n\n(**Observation 1:** after my shower, I noticed there was a lot of flaking around my nose, which I gently rubbed off - never scratch).  The redness was same as before the shower - do not expect this to subside until after a week of treatment at the very least.  I followed this with a thin layer of **Squalane** Oil on my facial problem areas.  \n\n**After my shower, I realised that I forgot to do the Nizoral anti-fungal because I'm dumb - if I don't make any progress today, I'll remember to apply Nizoral tomorrow.  In other words, I did not follow the treatment steps:**\n\n1. Vinegar\n2. Vanicream Zinc Soap\n3. Selenium Sulfide Shampoo\n4. (**skipped**) Anti-fungal - **Nizoral** (could also use Azelaic Acid 10% or Fanacea's gel which has an azelaic acid concentration of 15%)\n5. Any Moistruiser that does not feed the Malassezia = I used Squalane oil - can also use MCT oil",

    "body": "Hi there, it's me again. I've been doing more research into sebderm.\n\nHere is a useful summary of what I have found. This is a supplement to my earlier post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how\\_i\\_got\\_severe\\_sebderm\\_and\\_hair\\_loss\\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how_i_got_severe_sebderm_and_hair_loss_under/)).\n\nI'm prompted to do more research today because my earlier protocol is way too strong and not suitable for long-term use. It's a great emergency protocol though.\n\n**The summary (focusing on external factors only)**\n\nIn order to manage/treat sebderm (whether on scalp or face) in the most effective way possible, there are five things we need to do:\n\n1. tackle the biofilm\n2. kill the fungus/yeast\n3. replenish our skin barrier\n4. use mild surfactant\n5. reduce/lower the inflammation\n\nHowever, most dermatologists are getting getting 1/5 or 2/5 of the story by prescribing different anti fungal shampoos e.g. zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and ketoconazole. Some will prescribe clobetasol for treating the inflammation. In order to solve the problem at its root, all five components must be tackled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 1. biofilm**\n\nBiofilms are formed when malassezia, the overgrowth of which causes sebderm, adhere to surfaces and excrete a glue-like substance to protect themselves from antifungals. The biofilm can make them up to 1000 times more resistant to antifungals. This is why the antifungals prescribed by derms only work for a while. Without tacking the biofilm problem, upping the concentration of harsh chemical will only further destroy our skin barrier, which is the root cause of our sebderm.\n\nTo disrupt the biofilm, xylitol at 5% has been clinically proven to be effective, so is selenium sulfide. However, the problem with selenium sulfide is that it's a harsh chemical that may further destroy our skin barrier. I've ordered a biofilm shampoo from the biotech company listed below (disclaimer: not affiliated). It came up when I was searching for sebderm biofilm shampoo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 2. killing the fungus**\n\nAvoid any products that may feed malassezia. And use an anti fungal. Many things will do, e.g. MCT oil without lauric acid, ciclopirox, and ketoconazole. I think garlic and sea salt would also work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 3. replenishing our skin barrier**\n\nThere is actually a study that shows that a glycerol-containing leave-on scalp treatment reduces dandruff ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264904431\\_A\\_high\\_glycerol-containing\\_leave-on\\_scalp\\_care\\_treatment\\_to\\_improve\\_dandruff](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264904431_A_high_glycerol-containing_leave-on_scalp_care_treatment_to_improve_dandruff)).\n\nTherefore, adding a scalp treatment as a moisturizer may be beneficial. Be aware of the other ingredients in the formula that may feed malassezia though. I'm going to experiment with a DIY glycerin/niacinamide/panthenol scalp treatment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 4. mild surfactants**\n\nMany of the anti-dandruff shampoos in the market use very harsh surfactants that may further disrupt our skin barrier. Although many dermatologists claim that these surfactants, e.g. sodium lauryl sulfates, are fine at a lower concentration, I've experimented this personally. I used a medicated selsun blue shampoo with harsh surfactants on my hand. Then my skin immediately felt rough and bumpy. This is healthy skin with an intact skin barrier. Imagine what our poor scalp, which is already suffering from sebderm, has to go through every time we shampoo. And we usually don't apply a moisturizer to our scalp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, this is not to say we have to avoid harsh surfactants at all costs. A good place to start is probably to use more potent surfactants for a short period of time to remove any buildup, then switch to no-silicone hair products with mild surfactants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 5. reducing/lowering the inflammation**\n\nInflammation is a product of the overgrowth of malassezia. Once we have tackled problems 1-4 above, this should not be a problem. However, while we are still suffering from sebderm, some ingredients such as panthenol, niacinamide, licorice extract, colloidal oatmeal help calm down the inflammation and sooth the skin. Look for shampoos and/or scalp treatments that contain these ingredients. They can also help us rebuild our skin barrier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhen dermatologists only focus on instructing us to use harsh chemical shampoos for a prolonged period, this probably worsens the problem as it furthers damage our skin barrier and does not give our skin the opportunity to heal itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References (disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with any of the following sources)**\n\n[https://kanebiotech.com/biofilms/](https://kanebiotech.com/biofilms/)\n\n[http://www.ringierevents.com/eve\\_files/files/e86a92be8063408e98b37f5cb1b4565b.pdf](http://www.ringierevents.com/eve_files/files/e86a92be8063408e98b37f5cb1b4565b.pdf)\n\n[https://www.dandruffdeconstructed.com/biofilms-seborrheic-dermatitis/](https://www.dandruffdeconstructed.com/biofilms-seborrheic-dermatitis/)",

The bacteria in your gut compete with fungi. If you don’t have enough healthy bacteria, the fungi will over colonize the gut. A simple way to increase good bacteria is through eating more fiber/probiotic. \n\nI have also seen other redditors mentioning stress as a cause for their flares. \n\nBakers p & s liquid broke down my bio films fast.\n\nI also believe that the body needs nutrients. In other words, it is important to take a multivitamin. The immune system will struggle to function correctly without vitamin d, zinc, vitamin c, and so on. Studies have shown that histamine is 2.5 times greater in SD patients. I’m starting to think about ordering a food allergy/sensitivity test. Maybe food isn’t the direct cause of my SD but it may help. Sometimes children develop eczema due to sensitivities to certain ingredients.",

What has worked for me at various times:: \n\n* apple cider vinegar + water 1:1 (or 1:2 if you're very sensitive) ratio sprayed on the scalp & left for a few minutes before being rinsed out. I played around with doing it before shampoo and after. After left my hair softer & not needing to follow up with conditioner. \n* oat flour + plain yogurt scalp mask. Oat flour can be made with a coffee grinder & regular oatmeal. It's important that the yogurt not have sugar. Mix together, apply to scalp, leave on for 10-15 minutes & follow your normal hair routine.\n* aloe vera + raw honey \"shampoo\"/mask. Can be used as a scalp mask, or \"shampoo\". It needs to sit on the scalp for a minimum of ~3 minutes. The aloe must actually be from the plant & not the shelf stable stuff sold during the summer that's dyed blue or green. Add a splash of hot water to 1 tablespoon of honey to make a runny consistency, add 2 tablespoons of aloe, mix thoroughly, apply, massage into scalp, & rinse. This usually left my hair soft without having to follow it up with regular shampoo or conditioner. \n\nAs with anything, your results may vary. \n\nEdit: these aren't supposed to be used all at once, but are three different things to try one at a time. You might only want to try one & that's fine. You should see how your scalp reacts before trying a different option. If this is too crunchy granola & none of this interests you, that's okay too. :)",

It took about three weeks of consistent use (almost every day) to see improvements. From then on, it has continued to improve. \n\nObviously I’m not a doctor, nor a scientist so I can’t really know for certain, but I think my eczema is due to an overgrowth of yeast on my skin. \n\nI still have eczema, mostly in the crooks of my elbows and occasionally on my neck, but it is so mild now that I forget it’s there.

    "body": "I have been dealing with Seb Derm since the beginning of April. Could not get a dermatologist appointment anywhere until May. I lost a significant patch of hair that resulted in 2 bald spots.\n\nThanks to this subreddit, I was able to get rid of the burning & itching with Bulletproof MCT Oil (C8). However **nothing** worked for the scales. I tried T/Sal, selenium sulfide, Nizoral, prescription ketoconazole 2%, (once I finally saw a doctor), Clobetasol, Head & Shoulders, apple cider vinegar, Dead Sea salt, etc. It’s like the scales were fused to my scalp, which I’m quite sure was restricting hair growth.\n\nI got desperate and tried something I’ve had on my nightstand for my face: Paula’s Choice BHA Liquid Exfoliant. I applied it to the scales in the morning, left it on for 3 hours, and then washed with Head & Shoulders.  Then, I took a pin (like for pinning fabric while sewing) and used the flat head of the pin to *very gently* scrape the tops of the scales, going around what little growth I’d gotten back. And THEY CAME RIGHT OFF! None of the surrounding areas the liquid exfoliant touched were damaged (i.e. no damage to existing hairs). I’d tried the pin method before without success, so I know it was the BHA that made the difference.\n\nIt’s been a few days and the scales haven’t returned.  So if anyone else is experiencing this issue, I highly recommend this method.",

Pyrithione zinc worked for awhile, and then it didn't. I was prescribed 2% ketaconzole shampoo by my dermatologist, and the horrible itching and flaking went away. Almost exactly a year later, it suddenly stopped working, with no change in diet or hair product. I was prescribed a topical steroid (clobetasol) and selenium sulfide shampoo 2.25% and my SD went away almost completely. It was such a relief--until about a year later (two months ago) my SD came back in full force--the worst it's been in years. I went to my dermatologist and he actually re-prescribed 2% ketaconzole, even when I explained it stopped working for me last year. He said that about every year or two, severe, pervasive SD may become resistant/immune to the current medication. I was skeptical, but it's been a week since I've been back on ketaconzole and my scalp is free of pain and flakes! My dermatologist said I'll likely need to rotate between ketaconzole/selenium sulfide every year or so to keep my SD under control.\n\nI wanted to share this in case others have written off previously used shampoos because they stopped working--give them a try again.",

I don’t have any make up on except blush and the lightly tinted spf. I have tried ALOT of products recommended in this subreddit. My take was just trial and error to help my situation along. Didn’t go to a derm but I know it’s fungal because changing to an FA safe routine made all the difference.  My skin had tiny little bumps that spread from my forehead to the rest of my face. They were very itchy!! \n\nI currently run all my products through skinsort and sezia. Also I want to say that benzoyl peroxide 5% differin brand made a huge improvement but I stopped using it because of the news regarding benzene. \n\nHere’s a short list of products that either didn’t do anything or broke me out. \n\nAnti-fungals that didn’t work: nizoral, head and shoulders, lomitrin. \n\nMoisturizers that didn’t work: purito oat calming gel (I know!), biossance squalane(my face hates squalane), Malezzia moisturizer(gave me closed comodones)\nSPF that didn’t work: colorscience flex, cetaphil sheer, banana boat baby mineral. \nToners that didn’t work: Anua rice toner\nSerums that didn’t work: Dr Althea vitamin C, anua azalaic acid \n\n\nThings that DID work and I’m currently using! \n-hylauronic acid wash from malezia\n-eucerin healing ointment (holy grail)\n-Equate anti dandruff shampoo(selenium sulfide)(just suspended this now that skin is clear!) \n-cetaphil sun everyday tinted sunscreen \n\n\nCURRENT ROUTINE \n\nAm: EVERY DAY I just apply SPF (Cetaphil sun everyday mineral tinted sunscreen)If my face is too oily I will splash water and PAT dry and apply spf. \n\nPm: EVERY NIGHT  wash my face with warm water and hylauronic acid wash from melazzia. Pat face dry never rub.  I moisturize with eucerin healing cream (rub a tiny amount on palm of hand) a little goes a long way! And then pat my face! Don’t rub on as I believe this spreads acne. \n\nEVERYOTHERDAY-do a 2-3min mask of equate anti dandruff shampoo.( this has given me amazing results). Or if this is too much go down to once a week, or just use the shampoo as facewash instead of doing the mask. I have dandruff and started using this on my scalp and notice a huge difference in scalp health! However I did over do it one time and my scalp burned for a few days so beware! \n\nOther things I’ve done:\n-wash my hands with dove sensitive bar prior to washing face.\n-Change pillow cases frequently! I even bought hand towels that I use once for my face and then throw in washer.\n-If you apply conditioner on hair, wash and dry hands prior to putting on moisturizer.\n- don’t touch face! Even if it’s itchy \n\nA few other items that didn’t help but didn’t hurt my progress. \n- Anya heart leaf toner\n-La Rochay posay sensitive fluid, didn’t moisturize enough \n-almond clear manda lic acid \n- differin adapalene \n\nI cut back on actives and that improved my skin! Less is more sometimes we ruin our skin barrier and exacerbates our fungal acne.  \n\nAlso reduce cortisol!!!\n\n\n",

Here is a quick summary of some of the key insights from the report they released on the 27.11.2024:  \n  \nThe Phase 2 extension trial of AZR-MD-001, a selenium sulfide ophthalmic ointment, demonstrated its effectiveness in treating meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) over a 6-month period. The study found that both 0.5% and 1.0% concentrations of the ointment significantly improved MGD clinical signs, including meibomian gland secretion and expression, and alleviated dry eye symptoms, as evidenced by reduced Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores. The 0.5% concentration showed particularly strong efficacy, with more participants achieving normal meibum secretion. Safety was generally good, with treatment-emergent adverse events  being mild to moderate and decreasing over time. These findings suggest AZR-MD-001 may be a promising new treatment for MGD, offering improvements in both signs and symptoms, with a favorable safety profile.  \n  \nKey outcomes that improved included:\n\n1. **Meibomian Gland Yielding Score (MGYLS):** Both the 0.5% and 1.0% AZR-MD-001 groups showed statistically significant increases in the number of glands producing liquid meibum, with the 0.5% group showing a 1.9-point improvement and the 1.0% group a 1.1-point improvement compared to vehicle at 6 months.\n2. **Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI):** The 0.5% AZR-MD-001 group experienced a significant reduction in dry eye symptoms, with a 4.5-point improvement in OSDI scores at 6 months compared to the vehicle group.\n3. **Meibomian Gland Score (MGS):** Significant improvements in meibomian gland secretion quality were observed, with the 0.5% AZR-MD-001 group showing a 4.7-point improvement compared to vehicle at 6 months.\n4. **SPEED (Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness):** Both treatment groups showed reductions in SPEED scores, with the 0.5% group showing a 2.3-point improvement at 6 months, significantly better than the vehicle group.\n\nLink to the publication: [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39613259/)\n\nLet me quickly put this into perspective for those who are not familiar with clinical studies. The requirements are very strict, if medication manage to perform that well without serious side effects, this is a real reason for hope! I hope this makes your day. It for sure made mine. ",

It flares up most often when it’s dry, and I’m stressed.\n\nETA:   While the cause of seborrheic dermatitis is unknown, it is believed to be related to the skin’s oil production, due to the locations it appears and the fact that it predominantly affects people with oily skin. The current theory is that the oil throws the skin’s microbiome—which includes fungal bacteria—out of whack, resulting in the skin becoming irritated, itchy, and scaly. Given how many things in the body are affected by autism/adhd (digestive system, hypermobility, heat processing, etc), it wouldn’t surprise me if skin oil production is affected as well.",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is a story of how I have successfully grown my hair back after some really serious sebderm and hair shedding about 2 years ago (this is also part 2 of my original post [How I Got Severe SebDerm and Hair Loss under Control in Two Months](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how_i_got_severe_sebderm_and_hair_loss_under/)).\n\n**Before and After Pics**\n\nI have successfully regained about 1/4 of my original hair thickness and grown it back to where I was before sebderm. Here are some pics showing my results.\n\nBefore Pics (taken back in summer - fall of 2021): [Before Pics](https://imgur.com/a/xwm1xSD)\n\nAfter Pics (taken recently - Aug-Oct 2023): [After Pics](https://imgur.com/a/cBiawki)\n\n**Overall Approach**\n\nExternal products e.g. shampoo etc is only one part of my routine. I also believe that our skin / hair reflects what's inside. I have set out below every single thing that I think is helpful for growing my hair back, focusing on external and internal factors.\n\n**Hair Products**\n\nI keep my shampoo routine really simple and I do NOT use any hair growth serums etc. I personally believe most of them are not helpful and many of them contain ingredients that may worsen sebderm.\n\nHere is a list of the products I have been using for almost a year:\n\n* Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Scalp (contains selenium sulfide) - I generally use this once a week (but where I am experiencing a really bad flareup, I will use it twice a week until the flare up goes away).\n* Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Sensitive Scalp\n* Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (mint green one not the opaque dark green one)\n* Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo (once a week or every 10 days to remove buildups)\n\nI shampoo every other day.\n\n**Scalp Massage**\n\nScalp massage can help improve blood circulation on the scalp, hence helping hair growth. I use a five-tooth wooden comb to massage my scalp for at least 5 minutes every time before I shampoo my hair. The comb is available on amazon and is quite affordable.\n\n**At-home Low-level Light Therapy**\n\nI have been using the iRestore Pro helmet for over a year now. As I am doing multiple things in my routine at the same time, I cannot say how efficient this one single method is but I do like using the helmet also for the anti-inflammation benefits of LLLT. I use LLLT on days when I do not shampoo my hair, so this is how my routine looks like e.g.\n\n* Mon: scalp massage with a wooden comb for five minutes then shampoo my hair\n* Tue: non-shampoo day where I use the iRestore helmet\n* Wed: scalp massage with a wooden comb then shampoo\n* Thu: non-shampoo day where I use the iRestore helmet\n* Fri: scalp massage then shampoo\n* Sat: non-shampoo day where I use the iRestore helmet\n\n**Diet**\n\nI have tried a low-carb diet, plant-based diet and keto diet before. But what really works for me when it comes to hair growth is a Mediterranean diet. I only cook with high-quality extra virgin olive oil or avocado oil.\n\nI have made some personal variations to the Mediterranean diet:\n\n* I will occasionally indulge in a good steak, which contains iron and other nutrients.\n* I also love oysters, which are also nutritionally dense.\n\n**Supplements**\n\nI take the following supplements on a regular basis:\n\n* vitamin D3 (2000IU because I am an office worker and I do not like any outdoor activities),\n* fish oil / omega 3 (for their anti-inflammatory benefits),\n* magnesium (for helping with relaxation), and\n* calcium.\n\n**Hair-growing Food According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**\n\nI love TCM and I have visited multiple TCM practitioners to ask their advice on sebderm and hair growth. Following their advice, I have incorporated the following hair-growing food into my diet for almost a year:\n\n* Black bean milk (must be boiled if homemade, ideally made from fermented beans and no/low sugar) with a teaspoon of black sesame powder\n* Black mulberries: I have dried black mulberries on a daily basis. I also drink black mulberry juice.\n\nPlease note that most TCM practitioners in North America are a scam though and I do not personally recommend seeing a TCM doctor. The TCM doctors that I have visited are based in Hong Kong where TCM practitioners are rigorously regulated by the government and the practitioners graduated from top universities that offer TCM programmes in Hong Kong.\n\nI have personally conducted hours of research on TCM (I read Chinese). \n\n**Gut Health**\n\nTo have optimal gut health, it's important that we have a good ratio of **pro**biotics (i.e. the good bacteria) in out gut and include **pre**biotics (i.e. the food for the good bacteria) in our diet.\n\nOn top of the Mediterranean diet, I also make sure to have some **pro**biotics in my diet. I like natto (i.e. Japanese fermented beans). I will drink kombucha occasionally.\n\nMy TCM doctors told me that in order to have healthy skin and hair, gut health is essential. They gave me this recipe of a food-based **pre**biotic mix for me to add to my porridge / oatmeal in the morning. The prebiotic mix is very safe as it is consisted of food. As part of my routine, I buy the ingredients, put them in a blender to turn them into powder, add it (about 15-20g of the powder) to my millet porridge in the morning. Here are a list of the ingredients:\n\n* dried Chinese yam (Chinese: Huai Shan / Shan Yao) - ratio 2\n* dried lotus seeds (Chinese: Lian Zi) - ratio 1\n* dried China root (Chinese: Fu Ling) - ratio 2\n* dried Euryale seeds (Chinese: Qian Shi) - ratio 1\n* dried lily bulbs (Chinese: Bai He) - optional ratio 1.\n\nI will sometimes add some Job's Tear powder (5g) to my daily millet porridge if I have a really thick and yellow tongue coating.\n\n**Sleep Hygiene**\n\nI go to bed before 12 pm everyday and have at least 7 hours of sleep.\n\n**Stress Management**\n\nStress management is very important. There are many ways to manage our stress level. I personally love going to church and reading the Bible and you do you. Another important thing is to not get obsessed with hair growth (which I know is very difficult). Our hair follicles are very strong and the hair will come back.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nI am not a health professional (doctor / nurse / TCM whatsoever). The above is purely a summary of my experience and what suits me may not suit other people. Please reach out to a health professional if you have any questions. Also, I do not sell any products and am not affiliated with any of the products / brands mentioned in this post.\n\nIf you have any questions about my routine, please feel free to pm me (I check my inbox once a month or every 2 months and will answer all questions at one go).",

It’s a prescription and does bleach fabric so be careful with it. But it works, it may take a few weeks or a season, but it works.\n\nI get these sorts of flareups when the seasons change, like going from crisp spring to hot and humid Summer, then humid summer to the cold snaps of fall. It’s not contagious, it’s not because you’re icky, it’s just the flora under your skin over producing. Stress and hormones can also be a trigger.\n\nI’ll say again that Selsun Blue isn’t the answer. You would have to coat your body in it and just let it sit for a long, long time, but the impact is nonexistent in my experience while waiting for a provider to write a script. With ketaconazole, it starts working within a week or cause you can tell the slow of the spread.",

        "body": "Here's my advice if it is Tinea Versicolor: I have used a fungal cream in the past. It had come back, and so I changed my habits and it went away on it's own and has never come back. I used to struggle with this a lot during puberty, mostly because I didn’t know how to properly care for my bras or how to take care of my chest. Medication or treatment can help clear things up, but if you don’t change the habits that cause it, the infection will just come back.\n\nTinea versicolor is a kind of irritation is a fungal or yeast infection caused by moisture getting trapped. The breasts are an area that’s especially prone to this if you have larger breast or chest tissue. Here's what helped me:\n\n**1. Keep the area dry:**  \nAfter showers, swimming, or a sweaty day, make sure to fully dry underneath your breasts. Even a little leftover moisture can cause problems.\n\n**2. Wash your bras regularly:**  \nIdeally, wash your bra every 2–3 wears. If you get very sweaty, wash it after each use. Dirty bras can trap sweat, oils, and bacteria, which feed the fungus and make it spread faster.\n\n**3. Let your chest breathe:**  \nWhenever you don’t need to wear a bra, give your skin a break. Bras trap heat and moisture, especially if they’re tight or padded.\n\n**4. Choose breathable bras:**  \nPadded bras hold onto moisture the most and take longer to dry. I recommend switching to unlined fabric bras or, if you need more structure, molded bras. These are lighter and allow for better airflow.\n\n**5. Change bras if wearing them all day:**  \nIf you’re wearing a bra for long hours (or even all day), change into a clean one when you get home to avoid sitting in a damp, sweaty bra.\n\n  \nI hope this helps, especially for those new to the life of having breasts.",

    "body": "I've had moderate sebderm on my face for the past 5 years or so, but with these treatments I've been able to keep it under control to the point where it isn't remotely noticeable. What I've noticed is that a treatment will typically work for some period of time, and then will stop as you become resistant to it. The good news is, there is tons of different treatments that are effective and almost all of them can be found at your local Walgreens - these are what have worked for me. \n\n**Dead Sea Salt**: This is the first thing I tried and it worked for about 6 months or so. Buy some dead sea salt and mix it in warm water, then apply this to your face with a small towel for 1-5 minutes. If you are having a flare up, it will most likely sting - this is a good thing. Once you're done rinse your face off, your skin may be a little red and dried out immediately after so I recommend applying moisturizer (I prefer Olay). Overall, this method is good, but takes more time than the others so it isn't my favorite.\n\n**White Vinegar**: Once the Sea Salt stopped working, I turned to this method and it worked like a charm for about a year. In my opinion, its like the dead sea salt method, but on steroids. Buy a big thing of white vinegar and dip a small towel or toilet paper in it, apply it to your sebderm for 15-30 seconds or so and then rinse off. If you are having a flare up, this will cause it to burn - that means its working. Some people recommend mixing the white vinegar in water to dilute it, but I have very sensitive skin and never found that to be necessary. Once again, I recommend using moisturizer after.\n\n**Ketoconazole Cream**: I was very skeptical about going to a dermatologist, but once the White Vinegar stopped working, I gave it a shot. They prescribed me Ketonazole 2x a day for two weeks. This stuff worked better than anything I had previously done. Within days the sebderm would be gone and it was extremely easy to apply. Once the flare ups would go away, I would use it 2-3 times a week as needed. Worked unreal for about 2 years. Recently it hasn't been as effective which has led to my most recent treatment.\n\n**Selsun Blue Shampoo with Selenium Sulfide (1%)**: I just started using this this week and it has worked like a charm so far. I have been applying it to my face and leaving it there for about a minute or so before washing it off. After a day or so my flare up is gone.\n\n**Hydrocortisone Cream**: This was also prescribed to me and works very well, but I recommend you use it VERY infrequently. It can thin your skin out which I have seen firsthand (had rashes on my leg back when I was a kid and by overusing this shit the skin there got very pale and thin for a while). With that being said it is very effective if you need your skin to look good for a certain event/date/etc. I'd recommend spacing out use at least by a week if you are trying to use this long term.\n\nThat's all I've used so far. This subreddit has been extremely helpful for me over the years so I thought it'd only be right if I shared my own experiences. If anyone is confused as to how to use one of these methods I'd be happy to help!",

    "body": "As a stylist, the most frequent question I get is “how often should I shampoo?”. My response always is \"first and foremost, it's important to know how to shampoo properly so when you do, it counts\".  From how shampoo works to the most common ingredients, I answer all of your shampoo-related questions below. \n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html))\n\n**How does shampoo work?** ​\n\nYou can think of the active ingredient in shampoo as being within [two categories](https://www.nycoproducts.com/resources/blog/simple-science-the-difference-between-soap-and-detergent/): (1) non-detergents (soap) and (2) detergents. Non-detergents are made from natural ingredients and act as an emulsifier for oil and water. This makes it easier to rinse impurities away when it's washed out. Detergents are synthetic, man-made chemicals with active agents (wetting agents) capable of lowering the surface tension of a liquid. These are known as [surfactants](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/), and they do this by having a hydrophilic \"head\" and a hydrophobic \"tail\", which essentially allows the shampoo to stick to oils and dirt in your hair. Those oils and dirt are then swept away when washed out. Another way to understand the difference between non-detergents and detergents: the former will leave a residue behind while the latter will not.[ ](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/)[Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html) breaks down the purpose of other ingredients you'll find in shampoos to make them effective and pourable (i.e. the opposite of powered shampoos that are becoming more popular). \n\n**How often should I shampoo?**\n\n​Some hair types will need to shampoo daily and others only need to wash once every ten days or so. Preference also plays a role here depending if you're trying to achieve a sleek look or a voluminous one. Shampooing less will condense your hair over time and allow it to hold more oils, which shampooing more will remove oils and promote a fuller look. Think about the following factors as you keep reading through this post, and check out [Post-Workout Hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-post-workout-hair.html) to learn more tips and tricks for managing your hair with a busy life.\n\n*Your hair's density*\n\n* ​*Fine:* Needs to be washed daily, particularly if you have skin that is more oily. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too flat if they try to style it without washing and drying it first. \n* *Thick:* Can be washed anywhere from once every three days to once every ten days. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too voluminous or puffy if they wash too frequently. Thick hair also takes longer to blow dry and style, making it a nightmare to wash daily because of the amount of time it adds to your routine. \n\n*Your hair's condition/damage*\n\n* ​*Fine:* If your hair is breaking due to damage you should try to shampoo less - every other day to every three days. Giving your hair a break from washing and styling can help with mitigating damage. Use shampoos and conditioners that are moisturizing, even if they give a flatter look then you like. \n* *Thick:* Damage to thicker hair shows more prominently because there is more of it. Straight hair will often appear to have many flyaways, while on curlier hair damage can be easier to hide. Since your styling routine is already longer because of how much hair you have, avoiding a full wash and blow dry (i.e. heat) for as long as possible can help with mitigating damage. \n\n*The type of shampoo and conditioner you use*\n\n* *Fine:* If you aren't worried about damage, look for a volumizing shampoo and conditioner for day-to-day use. Clarifying shampoos will help strip extra oil from your hair, but should only be used once a week alongside a shampoo made for daily use. Avoid clarifying shampoos if your hair is damaged. \n* *Thick:* Look for moisturizing and hydrating shampoos to counteract your volume. [Co-washes](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/news/a56230/co-washing-benefits/) are also a great option for curlier hair, and can be used more frequently since they are a combination of shampoo and conditioner. They're a great option if you need to wash more because of your workout schedule or job. ​\n\n*Your Scalp*​​\n\nYour scalp is an important part of figuring out how, and how much, to shampoo. This takes trial and error, plus may change over time. Generally, you should wash as often as your scalp can handle it because, like the rest of your skin, it is constantly shedding  cells.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that washing your hair has no effect on the amount of oil produced by your sebaceous glands. This depends on hormonal and genetic factors, and the glands have no way of responding to oils on the surface of your scalp. The theory that you could \"train\" your scalp to be less oily was disproven in 1982 by [Kligman and Shelley](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13525782/).\n\nIf you're trying to avoid washing more frequently, then use a mixed boars bristle brush (BBB) to manipulate the scalp and softly remove cell build up. The Reddit page [No-Poo/Natural Hair](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/) is a good resource for advice on maintaining your scalp when shampooing less frequently. ​\n\n* *Signs you may be washing too much:* a scalp that feels dry or tight\n* *Signs you may not be washing enough:* ​excessive product/oil build up​\n\n**What is the proper way to shampoo?** \n\nTo help the shampoo work, emulsify it in your hands before applying. Start applying in at the back of your head, ending at the crown. Take around a minute to apply it. Similar to washing your hands, shampoo takes a few seconds to lift the oils and dirt.\n\n* *When you're looking for volume:* Pay attention to the sides and back of your head when shampooing and rinsing, as these areas are commonly missed. For thicker hair, consider washing (or rinsing) in two sections. If you've gone 3+ days without washing, shampooing twice also makes sense.\n* *When you're looking to smooth/leave natural oils behind:* Generally, use a minimal amount of shampoo and rinse it out fairly quickly. Try conditioning your hair first, then shampooing and conditioning again. See the \"volume\" bullet above if you feel like you need a deep clean. This is helpful but not always necessary.\n\n**Shampoo Ingredients**\n\nMany people search for shampoo via the phrase \"shampoo without chemicals\". Technically, if the shampoo has water in it this will count as a chemical, so a better approach is to search for shampoos via ingredients. I've given you a list to consider below. \n\n*Shampoo Without Silicone*\n\nSoluble silicone formulas can be washed out with gentler shampoos and conditioners that don't contain surfactants, and are capable of achieving the same results as non-soluble silicones. Common names on the bottle include:\n\n* *Non-solu​ble:* Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* ​*Soluble:* Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n*​Shampoo Without Sulfate and SLS*\n\nAs a rule of thumb, ingredients like Ammonium lauryl sulfate and Ammonium laureth sulfate tend to be easier on sensitive scalps than Sodium lauryl sulfate. To learn more about surfactants, check out [Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html). \n\n*Shampoo Without Parabens*​\n\nMost water based shampoos contain preservatives because without them they  will eventually grow mold or bacteria. Parabens are a type of preservative that are commonly used in hair products. According to The FDA \"scientists continue to review published studies on the safety of parabens. At this time, we do not have information showing that parabens, as they are used in cosmetics, have an effect on human health\" (Source: [FDA, Parabens in Cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/parabens-cosmetics)). They're usually easy to spot on the bottle because they end in the word \"paraben\". Common non-paraben preservatives are shown in the list below. To learn more about parabens, check out this article published by Cosmopolitan: [Wait, What Actually Are Parabens and Should You Avoid Them? ](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n* [*Common names on the bottle:* Midazolidinyl urea, Iodopropynyl, Isothiazolinone, and Sodium benzoate](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n*Shampoo Without Salt*\n\n[Sodium chloride](https://nutrafol.com/blog/15-shampoo-ingredients-to-avoid/) is another name for salt. It's used in shampoo and conditioner mainly to make the consistency thicker. A trend of \"salt shampoos\" has also been seen, where the benefits include being used as a [scrub](https://www.byrdie.com/what-are-salt-shampoos) for the scalp, plus being gentler on the environment. This has may have been influenced by the idea of adding [salt or sea water ](https://www.gourmandize.com/article-6582-put-salt-in-your-shampoo-to-solve-your-worst-hair-problems.htm)to your current shampoo. I wouldn't recommend adding sea water to your shampoo, as this could potentially generate bacteria and mold in your products over time. \n\n**Shampoo/Ingredients For Hair Care Concerns**\n\n*Hair Loss*\n\nFor assisting with hair loss, there are DHT-blocking shampoos plus ones with ingredients that help with inflammation. Saw palmetto, also known as [Serenoa](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/039463201202500435), naturally lowers the conversion of testosterone into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a sex hormone that contributes to human developments such as body hair, but it can also make you lose your hair faster and earlier. If you're experiencing any type of hair loss, the first place to start is with a doctor. You don't want to try different shampoos only to later find out a doctor would have pointed you in a different direction. \n\n*Hair Growth*\n\nShampoos with biotin are frequently marketed as being helpful for hair growth. It is also commonly added to shampoos claiming to reduce hair loss, but there is no [evidence](https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/does-biotin-really-prevent-hair-loss) that it prevents this. Consuming foods rich in healthy vitamins and minerals will help with overall hair health.\n\n*Dry Scalp*\n\nSome contributing factors to a dry or itchy scalp can't be solved with a shampoo. However, certain ingredients can offer relief.\n\n* ​​*Salicylic acid:* This can be found in drug store shampoos advertising scalp health. It will help remove scalp cells causing dandruff while also moisturizing dry spots. Consider using it seasonally during dry winter months, or on a regular basis as needed. \n* *Selenium sulfide:* Formulated to control more serious dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. It's also used to treat pityriasis versicolour, a common fungal infection that causes small patches of skin to become scaly and discoloured.\n* *Ketoconazole:* An ingredient that provides the same benefits as Selenium sulfide.\n* *Tea Tree Oil:* [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360273/) have shown that tea tree oil effectively fights many types of bacteria, viruses and fungi. These shampoos tend to be very calming and cleansing.\n\n*Naturally Grey Hair Turning Yellow* \n\nUse two types of shampoo: (1) a purple shampoo and (2) a moisturizing shampoo. Grey hair tends to pick up unwanted yellow tones from the environment, and purple shampoo will help combat these tones. The moisturizing shampoo helps prevent your hair from becoming too dry, which can be exacerbated by purple shampoo. Check out [Purple Shampoo](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-purple-shampoo.html) for more insight on your options for these products. ",

    "body": "For anyone out there struggling with dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis, or itchy, greasy scalp when trying to do NoPoo, I want to share my journey—because, honestly, this was the closest thing to a magic pill I’ve ever experienced. Looking back on how much pain and embarrassment my hair has caused me, it’s almost surreal to take my now-healthy hair for granted. I have probably read every single subreddit regarding this in desperation on my journey, and to return the favor for the little bits that helped me along the way, I figured I would try and give back my experience and what helped for me…\n\nBackground: Over a year ago, my scalp started randomly becoming so itchy that I would scratch it until it would hurt, and I developed horribly dry flakes/dandruff. As a result, my black t-shirt heavy closet shifted to only white shirts to hide the flakes of dry skin and dandruff and I would plan out days that I would wear black shirts only after washing my hair so I could temporarily wear them. I tried countless foul-smelling concoctions of apple cider vinegar, strong essential oils, etc… leaving my hair reeking of vinegar for days. I went through bottles of Selsun Blue, niacinamide, ketoconazole shampoo, Head & Shoulders, selenium sulfide—none of it worked. In fact, most of them only made my scalp more inflamed, itchy, and dry, leaving my hair fluffy and stinking of artificial fragrances. \n\nThere wasn’t a day I didn’t seriously contemplate buzzing my hair off. I’d sit in class, purposefully making sure no one was behind me to see the flakes on my shoulders. I experimented with various essential oils like rosemary and Mielle, hoping for a miracle, but nothing changed. I was ashamed waking up and seeing the amount of flakes on my pillowcase. and I begged my parents to help me see a dermatologist. Since I lived away from home, I was never taken seriously, so I suffered in silence and continued to experiment with everything from no shampoo, to multi-stepped hair cleaning approaches. I settled on NoPoo, and my hair was healthy, but the dandruff and itchiness persisted.\n\nI tried everything. I bought a shower filter, changed my diet, and tried every product on the market. The real needle mover ended up being washing my hair with Egg yolk.\n\nSo in an act of pure desperation, I cracked an egg on my head in the shower. When I emerged with soft, shiny hair, I was shocked. Waking up the next day I was even more surprised to find that my scalp was the calmest it had ever been. The itching was practically gone, and for the first time in forever, there were barely any flakes on my pillowcase.\n\nCould it really have been this simple all along?\n\nAfter seemingly perfecting my egg-based concoction, my hair was healthier than it had ever been. Adding MCT oil and tea tree oil I managed to reset my scalp to the point where I only needed to wash my hair once every 1-2 weeks. In between washes I recommend brushing with a wooden comb, or boars hair brush.\nFor the past 8 months my hair has been great, with no itching and an amazing texture. It may sound crazy, but sometimes the most unconventional methods are the ones that actually work. So, if you’re in the same boat I was, you’re desperate and will try anything, so I highly recommend giving this a try. It changed my life and confidence so hopefully someone else can benefit as well.\n\n\nFor my mid length mens hair I used : 2 egg yolks, 1/4th tsp MCT oil (give or take), 2 drops tea tree oil\nI would dampen my hair in the shower, add the mixture to my scalp/hair and massage it in for a minute or so, then let it sit for 3-4 minutes while I wash my body and waited around for a bit, then rinsed it out. Remember not to do this with too hot of water or you may get scrambled eggs.\n\nBelow is the scientific reasoning behind eat ingredient, which I never thought too deeply about in the moment: \nEgg Yolk\nNourishing and Moisturizing: Egg yolk is rich in vitamins (A, D, E, and B-complex) and fatty acids that nourish and moisturize the scalp, which can be beneficial for dry and flaky conditions like seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis.\nProtein and Lecithin: Egg yolk contains proteins and lecithin that can help strengthen hair and improve its texture. This can be particularly helpful for conditions like tinea capitis and folliculitis, where hair health is compromised due to infection and inflammation.\nAnti-inflammatory Properties: The bioactive compounds in egg yolk can have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help soothe an irritated scalp affected by psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.\nMCT Oil\nAntimicrobial Properties: MCT oil, particularly those containing caprylic and capric acids, has been shown to have antimicrobial properties. This can help combat fungal infections like tinea capitis and bacterial infections associated with folliculitis.\nMoisturizing and Skin Barrier Protection: MCT oil can help maintain the scalp's moisture balance and strengthen the skin barrier. This is beneficial for preventing dryness and irritation seen in conditions like seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis.\nAnti-inflammatory Effects: The fatty acids in MCT oil have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce scalp inflammation and soothe irritation in conditions like psoriasis and folliculitis.\nTea Tree Oil\nAntifungal and Antibacterial Properties: Tea tree oil is well-documented for its antifungal and antibacterial properties, making it effective against tinea capitis and folliculitis. It can help reduce the microbial load on the scalp, preventing and treating infections.\nAnti-inflammatory and Soothing: Tea tree oil has anti-inflammatory effects, which can help soothe irritated and inflamed scalps affected by psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.\nSebum Regulation: Tea tree oil can help regulate sebum production, reducing the excess oil that can exacerbate seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n",

I only used it occasionally but it would work on clearing out acne around the nose. Not this time. \n\nAfter using the charcoal cleanser, my entire T-zone was inflamed bright red, and the texture of my skin was destroyed. \n\nIt didn’t calm down in the next few weeks. It got worse. My skin peeled off, the texture stayed bad, and people told me my nose was really red. \n\nI saw a well reviewed dermatologist at a respected hospital. They said it’s seb derm almost immediately and after inspecting it. They said I also had rosacea, but it was minor and we needed to deal with the seb derm first.\n\nFast forward through months of anti fungal treatments that according to studies are effective against seb derm. I’m talking ketoconazole, clotrimazole, daily cleansing (which prevented any healing), zinc pyrithione, oral anti fungal medication, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide. Guess what- they didn’t do SHIT. In fact, that constant cleaning of my sensitive skin and destroyed skin barrier was making it worse. \n\nSpoke to another couple dermatologists. We decide that since it’s not responding to anti fungal treatments at all it’s time to change course. I stop using anti fungal treatments and cleansers entirely, not even cetaphil gentle cleanser. Not even a week in, it was calmer. Turns out when you don’t nuke your sensitive skin every day it might actually have a chance to heal. \n\nFor context I’ve always had some cheek flushing but it would go away fast, and I NEVER had redness around my nose or forehead until this year. \n\nThe derm prescribed rosacea treatments, and holy fuck real progress is being made. \n\nDoing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity. Applying ketoconazole 2x day isn’t gonna start doing something in month 6 if it didn’t do anything in month 4. If you aren’t seeing results after months and months of treatment, get a second or third opinion by a professional. ",

This is my long, long list of recommendations for severe/complicated face/whole-body eczema:\n\n-going to the ER for when it was badly infected and very widespread (infected eyes, face, ~50% body. Sobbing from pain, losing vision, excessive weeping, deep cracks, *literally* non-stop flaking, loss of eyebrows/eyelashes,red bumps, yellow crusts, red and swollen all over). I didn’t know it was a staph infection. \n\n-at the ER: getting an oral prednisone taper, oral antibiotics, nasal antibiotic ointment to reduce staph colonization, prescription topical steroids for face and body—yes I used steroids on my face and eyes, they said it was absolutely necessary for the short-term. \n\n-got a referral to a derm from the ER for the next business day \n\n-at the derm: doctor told me all the swaps I needed to make, prescribed me dupixent, gave me a weaker steroid for face and told me to keep using steroids for the flare. Again, they told me it was safe, necessary, and would not damage my skin, and it didn’t. \n\n\n-switched to dove sensitive skin beauty bar for all washing, and cerave healing ointment for all moisturizing \n\n\n\n-after one round of oral prednisone and three rounds of antibiotics, the stubborn staph infection cleared and I had real relief\n\n-started dupixent, was on it for a couple months and then got prescribed protopic 0.1% for use on eyes, face, and body to manage flares without steroids. It’s a pain in the ass to use, but the day after I use it my skin looks fucking great. \n\n-been on dupixent for about 3-4 months now, and I’m ~95% clear, which is a miracle\n\n-got allergy patch testing per doctors recommendation, all came out negative, no allergies—however, insurance only let me test for 80 allergens, so it was an incomplete test\n\n-recently got pink eye as a side effect from dupixent. Tried to tough it out with eye drops but had to get antibiotic eye ointment from urgent care eventually, cleared it right up \n\n\n\nSome things I think are helping, but can’t be sure: \n\n-omega 3 oil (with vitamin d) and probiotics every day \n\n-tons of water\n\n-avoiding my one known food allergen (chocolate) \n\n\n-stopped vaping—maybe the patch test didn’t pick up a propylene glycol allergy because part of the patch did kind of come off, but I was vaping a LOT of pg\n\n\n-using a tissue to scoop out the cerave ointment to avoid contaminating the jar with any staph still likely hanging around\n\n\n\n-loose cotton clothing and silk pillowcases (not scratchy at all, feels great to sleep on)\n\n\n-castor oil before cerave ointment (really thick, keeps the moisture in) \n\n-keeping dandruff (caused by yeast overgrowth) in check. I can tell when I get a yeast overgrowth apart from eczema because I get a thousand tiny bumps on my forehead that itch. For this, head and shoulders selenium sulfide shampoo on my forehead, clears it up in 3 uses max, may sting a bit, but better than nizoral) \n\n-mineral sunscreen for my tattoos that react in sunlight \n\n-keeping my hair off my neck, I have dyed hair and use cheap conditioner so the less skin contact the better \n\n-suntanning when I wasn’t so inflamed\n\n\n-washing my hands way more often and not touching my eyes\n\n\n-using a face towel to wash face and body once and then putting it in the laundry, grab a new one \n\n\n-washing sheets, pillowcases, towels, and clothes often to reduce staph \n\n\n\n-no spicy food :( \n\n\nThis community has helped me a lot, and this is what I can give back.",

    "body": "Hello, I am new to reddit but I though I'd share my success story in the hope that this helps someone. I know the effect this can have on your confidence and the frustration of never being able to find a solution.\n\nI had staphylococcus aureus folliculitis on my lower back and thighs for about 3 years. I knew it was bacterial folliculitis because antibiotics cleared it up. And it was def folliculitis because my dermatologist did a punch biopsy. The problem for me was a few months after each antibiotics course ended, the folliculitis would return. Eventually I had to go on long term antibiotics, which I was very unhappy about.\n\nMy folliculitis was angry and red, and very deep into the skin layers. The bumps never had a head. Just angry red bumps damaging my skin. Each one would stay red for about 10 days, but leave a scar for a month.\n\nI'll give you the short version of how I solved it and the long version\n\n**SHORT VERSION**\n\n1. Washing with Selsun anti dandruff shampoo (explained in the long version) and using GladSkin with Staphefekt\n\n**LONG VERSION**\n\nThings that didn't work for me  \nBleach baths  \nHibiclens (sometimes made it worse)  \nAntibacterial soap  \nProbiotic juice that you drink, tastes terrible, made no difference  \nProbiotic skin spray - though i don't think it did any harm  \nAny and every pimple cream or solution  \nPrescribed antibiotic ointments, including up the nose  \nand lots of other things\n\nI started with a \"decolonising week\", and have been in maintenance mode ever since.\n\n1. Decolonised my apartment using a giant bottle of hand sanitiser with a spray nozzle. Something like 70% alcohol with a bit of Chlorhexidine in it. Every morning when I left for work I sprayed all surfaces that I regularly touch. Door handles, shower handles, taps, etc. And anything I leant against. Chairs, couches, mattresses, back of toilet seat, etc. There's no point in decolonising your body and not your living area. Cheap and easy.\n2. Selsun anti dandruff shampoo as a body wash instead of Hibiclens. Selenium sulfide is anti-fungal, anti-bacterial and keratolytic. It's cheap, it makes my skin feel quite nice afterwards, and I've continued using this ever since.\n3. GladSkin with Staphefekt. This is expensive, but it kills staph instantly on contact without affecting the other microbiota on your skin. You only need a super thin layer each application. I buy the acne gel, but you can buy any. I shower twice a day, and I apply the Gladskin straight after drying. BTW during my \"decolonising week\" I also stuck it up my nose, hanging my head upside down, placing big globules in each nostril and massaging it right up and down the canal. This is definitely off label use, and I've lived to tell the tale. I dried out my nose half an hour before with Sudafed flu tablets. I also did between the bum cheeks for a week, under arms etc, anywhere where staph can hide\n\nI now only use the selsun and GladSkin on the areas where the original issue was.\n\nAnd that's it. I have gone from getting around 10 new bumps every month, to getting one bump every 2 years. I would guess the last time I got a bump was mid-2022. I use 2 bottles of the Staphefekt gel 100ml per year. I keep it in fridge. The gel is better than the cream IMO as you can get a thinner layer spread over a larger area, ie it lasts way longer. When you see the price, you'll appreciate the value of making it last longer\n\nI hope this helps someone. If you want to ask questions, I'm happy to answer. Sorry I don't have a better photo, but if any of you have folliculitis bumps that look something like the one in my photo, try what I did\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj409dw3tjrd1.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=bab2774b3c78499fc8f213ddd8b258f55d1701c9",

I figured out that the likely culprit is my immune system reacting to the waste product of a common yeast which feeds on the sebaceous oil we all produce. Therefore-->impede the fungus' ability to proliferate in my scalp=eliminate symptoms of seb derm. Like any fungus it takes a little time to grow and establish. When it's well established it takes time to kill it, and for it to be shed, so be patient. When it's knocked back, there is some wiggle room to go a couple days without showering, but don't take it for granted, you must continue the regimen for life.\n\nThe regimen:\n\nRotate shampoos (each day use a different one), and apply the same conditioner, each time. That's it. 6 months free and clear. The shampoo details are important.\n\nSelson blue: medicated (selenium sulfide 1%), itchy dry scalp (pyrithrione zince 1%), and naturals (salicylic acid 3%).\n\nKetoconazole shampoo, and a coal tar shampoo.\n\nHead and shoulders conditioner (0.5% zinc)\n\nThe zinc compounds are a *highly* effective and long lasting fungicide. The conditioner is slightly  greasy but it sticks to the scalp and delivers the fungicide (zinc) throughout the day. \n\nIMPORTANT DETAILS: You HAVE to let the shampoo sit on your scalp for 5-10 minutes. It needs time to penetrate your sebaceous glands and skin in order for the fungicide to reach the fungus. It's embedded deep in the dead cells and glands in your skin. Suds up, rinse, suds up again, and don't wash it out until you're about to get out of the shower. None of these shampoos are effective if you don't use them properly. For BEARDS use the exact same technique. I did this with equal success and kept my lucious beard.\n\nFace: somewhat controversial it seems, but I've been putting hydrocortisone cream to spot treat problem areas on my face for almost 2 years, and it eliminated my facial sebderm. Wash/scrub with soapy water, pat dry, apply hydrocortisone cream. A little goes a long way.\n\nGood luck and don't be afraid to spend the money on all these shampoos at once, they last a long time and it was worth every single penny. My only regret is that I didn't do this earlier.",

    "body": "Hello there! Once I got diagnosed with alopecia areata, I tried everything and anything under the sun to see what would help. My hair started falling out in handfuls on 8/17/19.\n\nToday is 11/24/19 & the hair loss has really slowed down, to the point where some days I don’t lose but more than 10 strands & I have regrowth all over. I want to share my journey with AA just in case someone reads something that they may feel they can apply and may help them somehow. \n\nI am a female, 24 yrs old. Healthy & active, no other conditions/illnesses afflicting me. My hair has always been “my thing.” I’ve always had my hair long, before this AA episode it reached the bottom of my back. Full, healthy, shiny, straight hair. I never used heat or products on it. I wash it daily  (bc my hair gets oily at the end of the day & I work out 4-5x a week & when I tried washing it every other day, my hair broke out. So for me, washing it daily is what works.) I get regular trims every 3 months. I have never dyed it. I just comb it after the shower & let it air dry. My pillow sheet is either satin or silk to avoid breakage. I have always taken very good care of my hair & always got complimented on it.\n\nSo on 8/17 while I was conditioning it & handfuls started falling out, I definitely freaked out. But I thought maybe bc my hair is so long, that it looked like a lot of hair when maybe it wasn’t? But when I got out of the shower & combed it, another ridiculous amount of hair came out, so much, that my head hurt. 2 days passed with the same thing, so I went and got a hair trim thinking maybe I had split ends & it was getting tangled causing breakage. But that didn’t help so I told my mom what was happening.\n\nWhen she check my head, in the back of my head near my neck, she found a patch. The patch had red bumps that kind of looked my pimples. It didn’t really itch. I went to get check out by a nurse practitioner. She thought it was dandruff that caused my to scratch & my hair to fall out from scratching. I’ve never had dandruff nor did I have it then. She gave me selenium sulfide. It didn’t help. Felt like more hair was falling out. So I stopped using it. By 9/9, the hair would still fall out in handfuls during my shower & when I combed it. I I decided to make an appointment with the dermatologist & got lucky enough to be seen the next day. \n\nBefore going to the dermatologist, I had been trying tea tree oil, a natural shampoo for fungus, a shampoo for dandruff, a shampoo or psoriasis, ginger, & fresh aloe Vera gel directly from the plant. Nothing was really helping. \n\nOn 9/10, when I saw the derm, I had a new bald patch forming at the top middle of my head and one in the middle of my hairline right above my forehead. As soon as she saw the patches she automatically said it was alopecia areata & told me there wasn’t really anything I could do. She offered me some corticosteroid injections directly at the site of the bald patches & I agreed to them. I grabbed an alopecia areata brochure on my way out.\n\nA week after the corticosteroid injections, I got my period even though it had just ended the day before I saw the derm. I knew it was a side effect from the injections. I got another period like 3 weeks later. And now, I haven’t gotten a period & it’s 2 weeks late (I am not currently sexually active). Basically, I know the injection has messed with my period. I’ve also been really sensitive and crying constantly the past couple of months (not sure if it’s correlated to the injections). Regardless, I do not like the effect the injections had on my menstrual cycle. And quite frankly I feel like they did not help the AA. \nI have not gotten any injections since. I didn’t even go back for a follow-up check 6 weeks later like she wanted. She told me there was nothing that could be done, so I canceled the appointment. \n\nThe first bald spot I had near the bottom of my head, grew to the size of about a golf ball. The one on my hairline didn’t really expand luckily. However, where I lost the most hair was on the top of my head. The bald spot expanded & more and more popped up and overlapped. I felt hopeless & powerless. I also had an overall thinning on the top of my head. I could feel tiny spiky hairs popping up, but a lot of them would fall out & when I looked at them, they were the typical exclamation point shape of AA. \n\nMy nails started showing the pinpointed dents on 9 of 10 fingers. On days when I lost a lot of hair, my head would hurt from how much I lost at once. My scalp would get inflamed & red & hurt when I pressed on it, sometimes with pustules that looked like little white pimples, and where ever this popped up, I knew my hair would fall out from there the next day. Sure enough it did. I finally had a breakdown when I read that those with nail deformations tended to be the most extreme cases. I would research endlessly and couldn’t really find anyone else mentioning how their scalp would get aggravated before a significant hair loss.\n\n\nAs of August 2019, right before the AA started, I didn’t feel stressed. But, as I sat down & really thought about it, I realized this has been a stressful year for me. I recently finished grad school and was unemployed the first 8 months of the year. In May, I had a devastating heart break. I almost got kidnapped in June & started living very paranoid during the summer. Just a lot of things piled up together & I guess I was really stressed. But I felt like things started looking up in August, until 8/17 when my AA started.\n\nAbout a month into my AA, my mom did do something a tad morbid. She started collecting all the hair I was losing & tying it up & keeping a chart of it. Some ppl thought it was a bad idea bc they thought it would make me sad to see how much I had lost, but honestly, I think it really helped keep track of my progress. She also takes daily pictures of my bald spots. The chart of hair helped bc on some days when I lost more, I could look back & see what I did differently the day prior that may have triggered it.\n\nThere are a few key things I felt helped a lot in slowing the hair loss down, as after I did each, I noticed less & less hair loss:\n\n-after the heartbreak in May, I made up with my S.O. beginning of Aug. before this started. But when the AA started, I would get really stressed when I realized I had to eventually tell him. I was just so worried he would see me differently & I was scared of losing him again. But when I told him & he told me his mom had it too & he didn’t make a big deal about it & he stayed with me & was supportive about it, that alleviated a lot of stress for me.\n\n-another thing that alleviated a lot of stress for me was buying wigs. Just knowing I had something to fall back on, & being happy with finally having a good excuse to try wigs (I had always wanted to) alleviated a lot of stress for me too.\n\n-I got the hair fibers Toppik, that eased my worries too, since with it, I didn’t have to wear hats or wigs, just had to switch up my hairstyle & sprinkle that on & I could feel confident again.\n\n-I STOPPED EATING GLUTEN! I noticed when I ate gluten, my scalp would get red & inflamed& I would lose more hair! This one was huge.\n\n-I started taking a multi-vitamin & biotin daily.\n\n-I started washing my hair with cooler water, & waiting it for it to almost be completely dry before combing it.\n\n-I accepted whatever fate I would have with AA. If I went bald, I would be okay with it. I changed my entire mindset. I understood hair doesn’t define your beauty, it adds to it, but you don’t need hair to be beautiful. I stopped worrying about it. I stopped freaking myself out reading statistics & reading up about it. I stopped focusing on it.\n\n-I did a spiritual cleansing. I’m telling you, desperate times call for desperate measures. My mom did a “limpia” with an egg, consecutively for 3 days actually. Interestingly enough, after the cleansing, this dent I had at an injection site popped back up to normal.\n\n-I got a haircut! I cut off like 8 inches so that my hair wouldn’t just look like I had 3 long strands. \n\nI’m not sure what worked, or if a collective of it all worked, but it seems the worst is over. The hair that is regrowing is not white, nor in little tufts. It’s regular colored hair that seems pretty anchored to my scalp in all places that I had lost hair. I feel like I was on a trajectory of potentially intense case of AA, but I didn’t give up on trying different things. I know everyone’s case is different, but I’m posting my whole story hoping maybe something could resonate with someone and help them somehow. Feel free to message me with any questions. I think I covered anything but I’ll add if I forgot anything & I remember it later. I wish us all the best.",

Had a stressful last year after graduation and the job market, was unemployed for 6 months after it and was extremely stressed as an international student living on a Visa. I’ve gone through AA when I was a kid. Had multiple bald patches, took years to find a solution and eventual growth was due to steroid injections. I was almost horrified to see a patch after so long in my life. As you mentioned, I love my hair - I still am not able to detach myself from the idea that my hair are the most beautiful part of me and I don’t want to lose them, but I’m working on it. This recent episode of AA, I decided to heal using natural remedies because Steroids I feel gave me side effects in the long term. I read about Minoxidil and concluded that the hair follicles do get dependent on it and if you stop administering it, the hair loss will progress which is why I didn’t use it. I’ve been using Bodywise Serum (Indian brand - contains Redensyl, Procapil, Saw Palmetto, Fenugreek (Methi), Moringa and Red Clover) and had regular Biotin gummies. I’m honestly not sure how much it helped or it was slow progress but after 6-7 months now - I started seeing regrowth. Along with this serum I’ve been applying fresh onion juice (I wish I could do this regularly, because I saw most hair growth after I started applying it). I’m still unsure when I see pictures of my patch if it is growing in size but I feel it is. There’s regrowth too though, a significant amount - so I’m just being patient with. Trying to not stress out and switching slowly to eating a healthy diet. Thankyou for posting this, it really reassured me. Would love to know the eventual result from you- how did it turn out and how’s it going now.",

    "body": "Hi, /r/SkincareAddiction. I've searched this subreddit for information regarding seborrheic dermatitus and facial dandruff, but a lot of the posts are either centered around general seb derm (as in, seb derm of the body/scalp) or old. While I have gleaned a few new bits of information about the subject from those posts, I was hoping to get some updated help about this issue specifically, and to perhaps find some solidarity in other sufferers, as I've been hard-pressed to find people with my exact issue(s). \n\nShortly after puberty, I started developing some flaking dead skin around my nose and eyebrows, as well as scalp dandruff. As the years went on, it exploded into full blown awfulness. When I was around 16, I went to a dermatologist and was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitus. I soon learned that my grandfather also suffered from it, but not to the degree that I do. \n\nOver the years, I've tried a slew of different techniques to try and combat it, though none have worked over an extended period:\n\n* I've used a variety of topicals prescribed by dermatologists\n* I've applied Head & Shoulders regular and medicated (the kind with selenium sulfide [note: I've also tried Selsun Blue]) directly to my face, left it on, and exfoliated afterwards, and that seemed to help for a while, but my skin quickly grew immune (I still use Head and Shoulders on my scalp, because it seems to work there, but it does not do a damned thing for anywhere else on my body)\n* I've tried products with coal tar, like T/Gel\n* I've tried products with salicylic acid\n* I ordered a Clarisonic-type rotating electronic scrub brush to exfoliate with \n* I've ordered exfoliating clothes (the Wonder Cloth, specifically) to try a less-harsh method of exfoliation\n\nMy current routine is as follows: \n\n> Before a shower, I apply ketoconazole (something that never really worked for me in the past, but I figured I'd try it again -- what's the harm?) shampoo to my face and leave it on for around 10 minutes. Then, either *in* the shower or before, I massage off the ketoconazole with a soft, warm, wet cloth, then apply Pond's Cold Cream and either use an exfoliating cloth or my electronic scrub brush to exfoliate away the thick layer of rough, dead skin. After, I splash off my face, then apply an emollient-based moisturizer. After that moisturizer has mostly absorbed, I hit my trouble spots (sides of noise, between brows, brows, forehead, tops of cheeks, chin, and hairline) with Vaseline. \n\nThis routine worked for a while, but within the last year, by the time I wake up in the morning, there's a fresh layer of thick, scaly, flaky dead skin all over my face. \n\nThis has become an absolute nightmare. \n\nAs someone who likes to wear makeup, I've had a LOT of trouble with it over the years, but lately, it feels like a battle. Even after applying a primer, I can't use liquid or cream foundations because they make the dry skin super obvious. I've switched back to mineral foundation, and though it works better for me, the dry skin is still visible in places. \n\nMy skin texture and coloration is a mess. Not only has the condition caused me to develop a rosacea-like redness, my freshly-cleaned skin is rough and has developed these tiny bumps all over. After applying mineral foundation, when I look in a mirror (especially in the light), it's super obvious.\n\nSorry for the long post. I wanted to make sure I was as thorough as possible. I'm so glad I found a forum to discuss this, as it's something I've been dealing with for years, and it's done quite the number on my self esteem.\n\n***TLDR:* Does anyone have any tips or general information about extreme seborrheic dermatitus? Is anyone suffering from this condition or a condition like this to this extreme? I feel very alone.**\n\nI've done a ton of research on it, but I can't seem to find anything that truly works for me. Please help. \n\nNote: I do suffer from symptoms on other parts of my body, as well, such as arms, ears (inside and out), and recently, my legs.\n\nAlso, I do apologize if anyone feels this post is redundant, but once again, I wasn't satisfied with any of the other related posts, but that might just be desperation talking at this point.",

        "body": "OK, I've been battling this for YEARS in the same places as you (mostly around my nose). I have found a few things that have helped a TON. In fact, since I started the beginner's routine here I haven't had a single issue on my face, only behind my ears.\n\n1) Sebhorrheic dermatitis LOOKS like dry skin, but it isn't! It is a build up of oils that irritates the crap out of your skin. Dry, flakey looking skin makes you think \"I needs moat moisturizers\" so you LOAD up on creams, lotions, ointments all to no avail. Because you're adding to the problem! I have found the cerave in the tub at night and the Cerave AM work well for me. I don't cake it on or slather it on either. Just a little. That's it. No ointments, thick creams or vaseline.\n\n2) Cleansing is critical! But gently… the shampoos etc on your face are probably way too harsh and are over stimulating the oil causing the problem to get worse. I found that gently cleaning with something like cerave foaming cleaners works really well. Gently. Seriously, don't scrub your face raw, it only makes it worse. You don't need a lot of exfoliation, just a washcloth and mild scrub. If you need medication, you can get topical creams from your doctor.\n\n3) LET IT HEAL. My skin breaks out into red rashy ick, then as it heals it all flakes off into the grossest grossness ever. Don't pick, don't scrub until your face falls off, just the same gentle washcloth with mild cleanser. Follow with a moisturizer.\n\n4) Makeup application: if you're in the process of healing, wash your face with a washcloth, apply moisturizer right away and then apply your foundation IMMEDIATELY after the moisturizer. It helps the keep the foundation from sticking to all the dry stuff. If you're broken out and you have the open weeping type rashy looking outbreak, better to lay off of the cosmetics and let it rest.\n\n5) Make sure you aren't aggravating it with your cosmetics. I used to have more problems with my face with certain cosmetics and fragrances. I have to be carful which foundation etc I use. I now use the Ponds BB cream because its light coverage and doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nI hope that helps. Once you find a routine that helps it, you won't need to worry so much about the makeup application.",

When it was discovered I had seborrheic dermatitis, I was given a bar of ZNP soap and Cetaphil lotion. That worked for a while. As the years passed by, it spread from my chin to the outer corners of my mouth, my nose, eyebrows/forehead, and now finally its reached my ears. For years I have tried different skin care products and routines and borderline became a product junkie. Right now I use African Black Soap and I moisturize my face with a Pond's Dry Skin Cream/homemade shea butter mixture. It helps to keep the flakes at bay and my skin feeling moisturized.

Each time, it shows up above one eye on my eyelid and then around my mouth/nose/below my lip. Anyhow- I have been prescribed ketoconazol shampoo that I use every few washes, in between I use head and shoulders and I also was just prescribed Promiseb about 6-9 months ago for use during flare-ups. The combination seems to be working well but when I take a break from the shampoos, which I use on my face quickly during most showers, it flares up again. Right now I'm just trying to figure out how to cover the rash/redness/flaking with makeup so I can work and not be so self-conscious and also try to keep the pain at bay. I'm not sure why but this time my lower face is so raw and so painful, burning almost. Aside from this flare up I normally can keep it under control for 3+ months at a time.  I would definitely recommend the ketoconazole shampoo/ head and shoulders combo (also as a quick face wash in the shower) and the promiseb topical cream helps a lot too. I plan on buying the noble soap and cerave lotions ASAP! Any makeup or pain suggestions?",

Make up is a primer, concealer if the red patches are bad, bb cream. I switched from liquid foundation to bb cream a few months ago and my skin is better. I don't exfoliate, but with psoriasis you're supposed to avoid irritating or possibly breaking skin. Have you ever tried phototherapy? If it's more than your face it sounds like you might want to ask your derm for nontopical treatments. If you're dealing with such a thick layer of skin daily that sounds pretty serious. I'm not sure bout the bumps, but I've had perioral dermatitis, reaction to steroid creams on the face - could it be that?

This routine is currently working well for me, my eyebrows and chin are clear and the patch by my nose almost clear.\n\nI'm still experimenting with different things to help my scalp, currently co-washing with a conditioner that has pir. zinc which seems ok.  I use selsun blue extra strength sometimes when I'm desperate.",

I finally got a more gentle skin care regime and that did the trick. I've been symptom free for a couple of years now. The biggest thing I learned is to use a gentle face wash. I tried not using any face wash thinking it might be too irritating but cleaning the yeast and oil off your face is very important. I use Cetaphil Gentle face wash, and also used ketoconazole, and you need to finish with a really good moisturizer - I use CeraVe in the tub. Apply Vaselline on top to set it in (as you're doing now) and the shininess should diminish with your powder foundation. Gentle washing, and good moisturization is key! It sounds like your exfoliation is too harsh. Good luck!",

The skin on your face is so gentle and susceptible. All the perfumes and stuff will just iritate it more.\n\nThe good thing about Scalpicin is that it is JUST the salicylic acid. That' s all.

I had a strong feeling my PD was fungal, as I’m prone to yeast infections since I was young. I started using an anti fungal cream and it was slightly helping me, but not enough for me to feel satisfied. My derm ended up prescribing my doxy. Before I started on the doxy, I decided to try out a selsun blue face mask, as I use it on my body for Candida rashes and it works very well. I never had to take doxy. \nI apply the shampoo to my wet face for 1 minute and then rinse it off, once a day. The first time I used this, my skin immediately felt better, so if it’s going to work for you you’ll know basically right away. Every single day my PD looks better, and it’s about 90% gone now. The selsun blue has been helping the acne on the rest of my face on top of it all. After the selsun blue mask, I apply an OTC anti fungal cream, no moisturizer as my PD really needs to be dried out to go away. I’m telling you guys, my skin is looking SO much better. Dare I say better than ever? I hope this helps someone else, and I’m curious if anyone else has had success with selsun blue as well!",

        "body": "For the most part you're right. Body wash and shampoo are a lot more similar to each other than either than they are different. Especially if you compared them to, say, bathroom cleanser, or dishwasher detergent. And it's certianly possible to find a body wash that you can use as both. But that doesn't mean that *every* bodywash is the same as *every* shampoo. Or if one body wash works as shampoo for you it will work for everyone else.\n\nIf you used dishwasher detergent in the shower the results would rapidly become unpleasant. This is because dishwasher detergent is actually *too good* at dissolving oil and will deplete your natural oils beyond what most lotions and conditioners would be able to make up for. This is called \"harshness\".\n\nHarshness depends on two factors: concentration and chemical identity. Certain soaps are just harsher than others, and no concentration will change that.\n\nBodywashes tend to be a little bit harsher, so that a \"mild\" bodywash might be as harsh as an \"average\" shampoo. The result is that if you have problems with dry hair the average bodywash is probably going to be a little too harsh, even with conditioning. It would probably take repeat uses before you notice, though.",

They're both primarily detergents. \n\nThat said, *most* shampoos do contain oily ingredients designed to act partially as conditioners, and most body washes don't. If you're going to condition anyway, this probably doesn't matter much. But if you don't condition, you're going to get a very different effect from the two, and not a good one for your hair (probably won't hurt your skin much). \n\nAlso, most shampoos are designed to *lather* differently, which will have an impact on how easy it is to get the surface area needed to reach all of your hair follicles. This is probably not a big effect, and can be overcome by different usage patterns.\n\nFinally, the fragrances used are typically quite different. Personally, I prefer a different category of scents on my body than on my hair, but YMMV. Shampoos rarely have \"deodorant\" fragrances, designed to cover up body odors, but rather have \"highlight\" fragrances, designed to add a pleasing scent. \n\nCommon bar soap is completely different, though. It's primarily a surfactant, not a detergent, which means that it is not going to be nearly as effective at removing oily components from your hair. It might be better at getting dirt off, though (however, hair is mostly oily rather than dirty, in typical situations). There are bar soaps made for hair, but they use different ingredients.",

Once, I used the Trader Joe's brand shampoo and my hair felt intolerably dry even after conditioning and using leave-in conditioner.  In fact, I had to wash my hair again later that day to fix the issue.  Similarly, I've used bar soap (notably, the cheap hotel soap) that makes my skin feel dry and rubbery.  My normal soap does not do this.  I don't personally use body wash, but I suspect that it would be hard to find a body wash that would dry out my skin, but easy to find one that would dry out my hair.\n\nThere's also a huge variance in hair types.  My dad likes the Trader Joe's shampoo because the effects are beneficial (in his opinion) to his hair.  This is mostly a function of how oily people's hair gets, how quickly it gets that oily, and that the comfortable level of oiliness in their hair is.\n\nThe point is, you can't make a blanket statement about soaps and shampoos and hair.  Substituting soap or body wash for shampoo might work for you, but it won't necessarily work for everyone.  (As for the other way around, there really shouldn't be an issue; hair is more easily dried out than skin, and most shampoos are designed to not overly dry out hair.)",

Sure.   One may wash themselves with shampoo or wash their hair with body wash.  There are even some body washes marketed as serving this dual purpose.  \n\nBut just read the labels on the ingredients.  You may get adequate results from using just body wash, but they are different. \n\nThat difference?  Specialization.  \n\nHair care is more complex than skin care.  Hair is highly diverse; ranging from thick, straight hair like those of many Asian peoples; to dense, curly hair that is most common in Africa.  hair can also be oily or dry; it can be fine or course, and it can have varying degrees of curliness; it can be naturally silky or naturally frizzy.   \n\nShampoo is formulated to deal with the specific requirements and properties of hair care.  Generic shampoo typically deals with the most common hair types for the culture in which it is sold; but there are also products for oily/vs dry hair.  There are hair care products for those whose hair has been artificially treated in some way (straightened, died, etc.).  \n\nI'm guessing OP is male?  This is typically okay; males tend to have shorter hair, where concern about long-term maintenance and condition of the hair is much less than that of longer-haired people, since it is cut frequently.   \n\nBut anyone with very long hair will agree that maintenance of that hair is very important to keeping it healthy; they would be unlikely to wash it with soap or body wash. \n\n(As an aside, conditioners don't replace the oil coating--that happens naturally.  Conditioners typically coat hair with waxy substances which are both heavier and more dramatic than natural body oils).",

I thought an ointment would be less rough for the face skin than a shampoo, plus it was cheaper so I bought it.\n\nTurned out that unlike in the shampoo, the anti-fungal substance in the ointment is ciclopirox with olamin (10 mg per 1 g, or 1%) and it works great for me! I've been applying a small amount of it once a day or once every two days and I've been completely free of any flaking or redness for 3 weeks now. This is the longest streak I've had in 20 years!\n\nI don't think I'm \"cured\" permanently (I suspect the symptoms will return after I stop using the product), and there's always a possibility it will eventually stop working, but so far I'm ecstatic.

Hopefully, some of this can help you find relief or give you new ideas to try. *(Not medical advice, just my experience!)*\n\n# 1. MCT Oil\n\n* **Brand**: Kiss My Keto Pure C8 Caprylic Acid (Red Label on Amazon, \\~$38)\n* **How I Use It**:\n   * Apply a small amount on my eyebrows, sideburns, above upper lip, corners of nose, and flare-up spots (back, sternum/chest, collar bone, behind ears).\n   * Massage gently before bed.\n* **Longevity**: A single bottle has lasted me over a year, and I still have about 30% left.\n\n# 2. Cleansers & Washing\n\n* **Garnier Micellar Water (Pink Label/Cap)**\n   * The most gentle cleanser I’ve used consistently for years.\n   * Removes oil without burning or irritating.\n   * I sometimes also use **Paula’s Choice BHA 2%** (though very rarely).\n* **Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength (Selenium Sulfide 1%)**\n   * I wash my hair daily to prevent oil build-up.\n   * Gently “scratch” it into my scalp, let it sit for about 30-45 seconds, then rinse.\n   * Missing a day or two isn’t the end of the world if it’s mostly under control, but I try not to skip.\n* **DermaHarmony 2% Pyrithione Zinc Shampoo Bar**\n   * Although it’s technically a shampoo bar, I use it on my body too.\n\n# 3. Supplements\n\nI’m not 100% sure which supplement specifically helps the most, but I suspect it’s the **combination** of them alongside better diet/lifestyle. I take most of these for general health or fitness as well. All are the **Sports Research** brand from Amazon (no particular reason, but I like their quality).\n\n**Nightly Routine Supplements**:\n\n* **Daily Probiotics** (60 billion CFU)\n* **Biotin** (10,000 mcg)\n* **Turmeric Curcumin C3 Complex**\n* **High Potency Zinc Picolinate** (50 mg)\n* **Double Strength L-Theanine**\n* **Antarctic Krill Oil Omega 3**\n* **Apple Cider Vinegar** (with Cayenne Pepper)\n* **Ashwagandha Softgels**\n\n**Morning Routine**:\n\n1. **1x MegaFood One Daily Multivitamin** (for Women and Men)\n2. Large glass of water (chug it!)\n3. **Shower**: At the end, I wash my face with Micellar Water, let it sit for about 15 seconds, then rinse it off.\n4. Finish with **30-45 seconds of cold water** over my entire body. It’s like a mini cold plunge—tough at first, but I’ve gotten used to it and it feels great now.\n\n# 4. Diet\n\n* **Big Takeaway**: I strongly believe this condition starts in our gut, and can be controlled or managed through diet/gut biome health.\n* **Past Experiment**: When I did **Keto**, my seb derm cleared up almost completely. But Keto is tough to sustain, so I’ve settled for a more moderate approach: cut out as much junk as possible.\n* **Green Juices**: I aim for 2x green juices per day (Arden’s Gardens brand: Yoga 1, Green Machine, Spinach Slam). I look for lower sugar options that aren’t primarily fruit-based.\n* **“Cheat” Foods**:\n   * Potato-based stuff (mashed, fries) doesn’t seem to affect me much. Ketchup is a small trigger, so I’ll have it sparingly.\n   * Cheese/milk in small amounts isn’t terrible for me. But combining dairy + sugar (like ice cream) can be really bad.\n* **Ultimate Triggers**:\n   * **Refined sugar** (sodas, candy, desserts, etc.)\n   * **Alcohol** (huge trigger, unfortunately)\n   * **Refined flour/grain products**: pepperoni pizza, white bread, pasta, etc.\n   * **HFCS** (high-fructose corn syrup)\n   * **“Gluttonous” Meals**: Large pepperoni pizza + beer + sweets = 3-5 day flare-up for me.\n   * I have to avoid soda with HFCS. Diet soda is less problematic, but water and juice are best.\n\n# 5. Lifestyle & Other Tips\n\n* **Sun Exposure**: I stay out of the sun—recent skin cancer scare, plus it just makes my face more oily.\n* **Manage Stress & Sleep**: Super important! Stress can cause flare-ups.\n* **Stopped Smoking**: Anything that can irritate your body or immune system may affect seb derm.\n* **Exercise**:\n   * Lift 4-5 times per week\n   * Run 1-2 times per week\n   * Walk 20-45 minutes every night\n* **Reading Recommendation**: *Good Energy* by Casey Means. There’s interesting information about inflammation that resonates with what I’ve experienced.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nI’ve pieced together this routine over several years, with plenty of trial and error. Everyone’s body is different, so what works for me may not be identical for you. But I hope at least one of these tips helps or points you in the right direction.\n\nFeel free to drop any questions or share your own experiences below. Take care, everyone, and good luck managing your seb derm!",

I find it interesting how it works great for some people and not really much at all for others. \n\nQuitting dandruff shampoo often causes an explosion of flakes because of its very nature. Dandruff shampoos are focused on stripping the scalp of everything that can feed fungus. So they harshly strip oils and have exfoliating properties also so there aren't any stray shed skin cells either. This results in a very dry and often irritated scalp. The treatment is to simply wait out the flakes, allowing it to heal and moisturize properly again. Here is some information about flakes you might find helpful.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/ltcccd/faq_dandruff_flakes_and_scalpskin_conditions/",

    "body": "{Also posted on /r/tressless}\n\n26/F here, have had hairloss for several years now. My hair had always been my \"thing\" - and right before it started falling out, it was in perfect condition and halfway between tailbone length and knee length (mid thigh?). People who didn't know my name would call me \"that girl with the hair\" and strangers would ask me if my hair was real, or if they could buy it. It was sorta the only thing about my appearance I liked. And no, I didn't dye it or chemically process it in any way.\n\nAt first, I thought I had started losing hair from losing weight. I lost ~120lbs and my weight stabilizing happened around the time my hair loss had really started happening in earnest. (~age 21).\n\nAfter over a year, the hair loss continued, to the point where I'd lost nearly half the volume. This led to my diagnosis of PCOS, with insulin resistance, and of course, elevated testosterone. This explained both my stubborn weight issues, and my acne and hair loss - or so I thought. I got on medication to stabilize my hormones, and got my testosterone in normal range.\nI've had \"normal\" testosterone and a stable weight for over four years, and yet my hair is STILL falling out like crazy. I take vitamin D, my iron seems normal, I definitely eat enough protein, I take multivitamins [prenatals, even], and I can't figure out what's going on. I've even started taking spironolactone even though my testosterone is normal now.\n\nIt seems I have [recently] some kind of seborrheic dermatitis, now, but washing too often or not often enough seems to make my oily, sometimes scabby-feeling scalp worse. It's not an extreme case, it's not generally visible except a little dandruff. Pyrithione zinc and \"sulfate-free\" shampoos make my scalp red and burn terribly for days after I use them - it feels like chemical burns or something. Selenium sulfide doesn't seem to do anything. Coal tar I've only tried a few times because the lingering smell makes me nauseous. Salicylic acid seems to exacerbate the problem. I've used Nizoral on and off for more than 2 years of this time. I tried Minoxidil for about a month but my already thin, greasy hair was constantly a humiliating oil slick.\nMy hair also seemed to get dry and brittle at the ends, even though I take excellent care of it, and breakage on top of the actual scalp hairloss makes the thinning much worse and more obvious. If I put my hair in pigtails, they're about as thick as a pencil each. I need a separate soft-bristle brush to put my hair back in a ponytail because bald patches of my scalp show through if I don't.\n\nMy question is: what's left? What do I do here? What can I do? What do I try? Do I try something I've already tried again? Something new? If so, what? It's still falling out like crazy and breaking. I've lost about 66+% of the volume and my doctors don't seem concerned about it since going bald only makes me emotionally sick. And apparently having hair the thickness of a single lock of hair means \"you're fine\" since that single lock is still pretty long. I'm terrified to cut it genuinely short, lest it become harder to hide the bald patches. My ponytail is basically an elaborate combover at this point.\nI have some pics, most of them are crappy from being taken with my laptop webcam, so I'm sorry about that.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/igSO7",

The secret ingredient: dry shampoo. It will both help keep your roots from getting flat and greasy and if you buy the colored stuff, it will help hide your scalp. I hear lots of good things about [this stuff.]( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/810xcpUdpgL._SL1500_.jpg)\n\nI know you're fond of the length and that you've already cut it but I would keep cutting.

        "body": "I'm a fellow PCOSer with hair loss as well.  That hair loss is actually what sent me to the dr.  A few things:\n\nLosing weight can further cause whacked out hormones (increased fat can cause increased estrogen).  Have you have your free testosterone checked since then? When you say it's in the normal range, remember that range is a generalization, and that normal range may not be appropriate for you. I had to get my testosterone into the bottom 1/2 of the normal range before I started really seeing results.  \n\nWhat medications are you on for your hormones? (I see the spiro note - what's your dosage?  How long have you been taking that dose?).  Spiro can take upwards of 9 months before really seeing results, and for long hair, it feels like even longer (because all of that hair has to grow back).  The therapeutic dose is 200mg/day per my RE.\n\nAre you insulin-resistant (or diabetic), by chance? Are you on hormonal birth control?  Have you had a full blood panel, including Vit D, B vitamins recently? Hair loss can be symptomatic of a variety of things.  Conditions like alopecia may be at play.  The pattern of hair loss can be indicative of the issue - is it around the crown of your head?  All over?\n\nRogaine may also be very helpful for you (downside is that you have to keep using it, or that hair will come right back out if the underlying cause is not addressed).  You may also want to try something like the Vanicream line of soaps/shampoos/conditioners.  I have found that my hair, even though a lot has grown back, is much more finicky, and I have to put in a lot of effort to keep it looking nice.  It's still not nearly as thick as it was when I was in high school.\n\nFWIW, this is my routine:\nEven though I've lost a good chunk of weight, I still haven't been able to get off of metformin for my insulin resistance.  I take spiro (200 mg/day), and it has been a huge deal - less hair on my thighs/face/belly, and more on my head (I also gained a couple cup sizes, which sounds better than it is).  I take hormonal birth control (Yaz) and have a Mirena.  I use shampoos that are sulfate/paraben free, and try to shampoo less than twice/week (and when I do, I shampoo the roots only, and condition the ends primarily).  I do not blow dry my hair, and use my flat/curling iron as little as I can.  Goes in a loose braid at night, and I don't fasten it tightly back.  I use a wide-toothed detangling comb, and usually use Argan or coconut oil on the ends.\n\nFinally, if you are being blown off by your doctor, it's time to find a new doctor.",

It was thicker than that when I was younger but it wasn't significantly thick. My hair has always been thin but at least my scalp wasn't that visible and it started getting thinner since I left school. Maybe due to losing weight in college. I didn't go to the doctor or anything. (Too lazy I suppose). I know I should go just to make sure everything is ok. I stopped using shampoos. I tried co washing using suave, also made my hair so greasy. So I ditched both shampoo and conditioner. I tried the nopoo water only method and I think it made a difference in how my hair looks. It just takes a long time for your hair to adjust.\n\nThe sebum in my scalp made it look more voluminous and when it looks greasy, I use cornstarch and brush it. After a while I felt my hair so waxy and the ends looked dry. The /r/nopoo community say it takes a long time and you should use some oil on the ends to moisturize it.\n\nI kinda got bored with how it looks so I got a shampoo bar with olive oil instead. I washed my hair with it then rinse it and then added two teaspoons of ACV with a drop of rosemary oil in a bottle of water and did a final rinse. Then left the mixture in my hair till I finished showering and washed it all off. Definitely made a difference in the texture of my hair. It felt so good getting rid of all the buildup from my nopoo method and my hair was so soft. I add a few drops of argan oil to my ends afterwards. I do this once a week and in between I wash with water only. I also take Cod liver oil capsules twice a day. and I see my hair has grown longer but still the scalp in visible. I know these things take a lot of time so be patient.\n\n\nI also found this post from someone who tried everything and just went water only and worked for him http://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/1uzaeo/i_think_i_might_have_cured_my_hairloss/\n\n\nI think the reason for this, is that he stopped using the shower. Instead he cleans his scalp with his hands containing some water and that's about it. I should try that too next time. I think the water hitting your scalp hard from the shower may contribute to hairloss...maybe.\n\nI'll save your post for future reference. Good Luck.\n\nHere's my hair in a single braid, http://imgur.com/hJEvtXB",

    "body": "I am writing this post describing my case history in the hope that it may help others. There is a summary at the bottom of this post if you want to jump straight to that.\n\nApril 2020 Accidentally but repeatedly banged forehead several times on a moss covered oak tree branch trying, unsuccessfully, to evict a squirrel from my yard resulting in a small graze to skin which I treated with antibiotic ointment.\n\nJune 2020 Scab located at point of impact still present, wound not healing properly. I picked the scab and treated variously and unsuccessfully with “second skin”, then antibiotic ointment followed by washing forehead with dandruff shampoo which possibly made things worse. New red area appeared at different location coincident with an infected hair follicle subsequently yielding a white pustule following bath.\n\nJune – August 2020 red area on forehead at location of infected hair follicle small but persistent.\n\nNovember 2020- A new raised bump appeared on forehead at a different location from the previous, itchy and scaly. Red area on forehead growing in size, bumps with yellowish silvery scale appeared on forehead and along hairline and left-side of face, treated with 1% hydrocortisone.\n\nDecember 2020 Telemedicine appointment with Dr. who concurred with me that my symptoms appeared to indicate psoriasis but difficult to diagnose via video. Dr. prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.025% which was applied as directed. Subsequently lost a large circular patch of skin on forehead following bath. My forehead became as red as a baboon’s bottom. Persisted with the cream for 2 weeks during which time more raised scaly red itchy bumps appeared primarily along hairline, spreading across forehead, down left-side of face then the right side. \n\nDecember 2020 Second telemedicine appointment with Dr. who prescribed Ketaconazole 2% shampoo thinking that the condition was perhaps caused by a fungal infection. Applied as directed (10 min application, then wash). The shampoo caused a very itchy dry skin reaction. Tried again 2 days later but limited application to 5 mins, then wash. Same reaction. Ceased using. Started using 100% aloe vera gel (alcohol & fragrance free). Skin became very dry and scaly.\n\nJanuary 2nd 2020 Overall condition worsening. Took matters into own hands. Deliberately exposed forehead, left and right-hand side of face to noonday sun for about 1.5 hours, then applied very liberal coating of Eucerin lotion to all affected areas (forehead, left and right-hand side of face). Left Eucerin in place for 24 hours then exfoliated excess skin using a flannel in warm epsom salt bath. Then applied a very liberal dose of aloe vera to all affected areas which by now were very painful and very red. Ingested 220 mg Naproxin Sodium and 30 mg of antihistamine. Ceased drinking alcohol. Although painful, that process seems to have calmed everything down, but red scarring persists.\n\n\nFebruary 2021 Dr. prescribed Ciclopirox cream for seborrheic dermatitis (SD). Used on face twice daily for the past 2.5 weeks. The medication made my face red, and my skin flake and fall off with no noticeable benefit. The medication does not seem to have mitigated the spread of the disease which has now moved to my eyebrows and eyelids and further down my cheeks and towards my nose. Ciclopirox cream seems to be of some benefit to address relatively new and small patches of SD, but seems to be aggravating when used on large areas of my face such as the forehead and the sides of my face.\n\nKetoconazole shampoo and pyrithione zinc shampoo have been used daily, alternating between the two, on my head/hair, face and body. Neither product seem to have mitigated the disease which has now spread to my chest and back. The shampoos have had no noticeable effect on the scaling on my scalp which appears to have increased.\n\nDr. prescribed Prednisone which has had a noticeable effect on reducing the inflammation. Once the Prednisone finished the rash got much worse probably caused by a rebound following cessation of Prednisone.\n\nThe deterioration of my condition has caused me to consult with my family physician, who prescribed Alprazolam to be taken as needed for anxiety.\n\nFebruary, 2021 Dermatologist performed 3 biopsies on right and left shoulder areas. \nBiopsy results are negative for fungal infection, but did provide evidence consistent with an allergic reaction. Dr. diagnosed rash on chest shoulders and back as Gutate Psoriasis\n\nRash spread rapidly from face to neck, torso, arms, groin and legs. Rash is in the form of red bumps that start small in size but grow into large lesions that shed skin and then bleed. Rash covers 80% of body. Dr. diagnosed as Erythrodermic Psoriasis.\n\nMarch, 2021 Dr. prescribed Methotrexate initially 20 mg/week. Lost most of skin from body. Took daily colloidal oatmeal baths using warm water. Applied Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% mixed with Cetaphil moisturizer to a all affected areas twice daily.\nMethotrexate is slow acting so Dr. prescribed weekly 300 mg Cosentyx injections, a biologic. Rash slowly subsiding, the biologic really helped. \n\nApril 2021, Health insurance denied Cosentyx, so Dr. prescribed another biologic; 100 mg Tremfya injections which really helped tamp down the symptoms. Rash receded to where it was back in February; face, shoulders, chest and back.\n\nMay 2021, body rash continues to recede, but red inflamed areas on cheeks persist seemingly untouched by the biologic. It has the appearance of seborrheic dermatitis a perception reinforced by persistent dandruff and scaling on scalp. Used Lotrimin Ultra, an over the counter anti-fungal on face for 10 days, with no measurable improvement. Following Dr's advice, I used Selenium Sulfide 2.5% solution on head and face for several hours a day for several days resulting in some improvement. It is a harsh chemical causing inflammation, and itching and dry skin as side effects which are also the symptoms I'm trying to cure. Backed off Selenium Sulfide to every other day, and switched in alternately to wash hair with coal tar shampoo. Zinc Pyrithione did not help at all. Added Sea Salt to Colloidal Oatmeal baths which exfoliates and dries out skin, but helped calm the inflammation on my face for the first time in months. I was also using an anti-fungal moisturizer \"Oregon maintenance cream\" on my face, but I am of the opinion that whereas moisturizers act as emollients they do not actually cure the problem so I use them as little as possible on my face. I am using \"Remedy Soap\" sparingly on my face once per day which also calms the inflammation. My goal is to dry out and kill whatever this thing is on my face.\n\nHere's summary of what I have learned.\n\n1. My dermatologist was at a loss to diagnose and prescribe suitable medications for seborrheic dermatitis, which in my case progressed to Guttate Psoriasis and then full blown Erythrodermic Psoriasis in just a matter of weeks. I narrowly avoided hospitalization. \n\n2. If you read the research literature there appear to be two parallel lines of research that attribute my symptoms to an \"immune disorder\" and separately to a \"fungal infection\". These lines of research do not appear to cross or coincide.\nThe evidence that it may be both is supported by the fact that the Biologic injections and the topical antifungals helped the rash on my body and face, respectively, but not vice versa.\n\n3. Although the Doctors I consulted with dismiss my hypothesis, I believe that my illness is a manifestation of the Koebner phenomenon that was triggered by the initial bump on the head. My Doctor says that my illness was caused by a genetic predisposition and stress. Research suggests that age (60) and sex (male) also predispose me.",

    "body": "I’ve had Seb Derm since I was maybe 14 or 15 (probably earlier, I remember asking my mom to buy my dandruff shampoo in middle school) and still dealing with it now at 24. However, I’m so much better at managing it now, to the point where it’s not making my life miserable and don’t have constant flakes and scabs everywhere anymore. Figured I’d share what has worked for me recently since I know how frustrating it can be and have felt the desperation of wanting to shave my head just for some relief. For reference, I’m a cis female with 2C/3A curly hair. \n\nThe first thing I used that made a huge difference was Nizoral. I first tried it when I was 19 and it seemed to almost “cure” the issue at first. But, after awhile, it stopped being as effective (probably because I was only using that and built up some resistance). I then switched to Happy Cappy and also use the Zinc shampoo bar from Amazon. Both have worked quite well and feel less stripping than ketoconozale or selenium sulfide. But I wanted to add another ingredient to the rotation to avoid building up resistance to pyrithione zinc so I also purchased Davine’s Anti-Dandruff shampoo (selenium sulfide shampoo, this one’s stupid expensive… Selsun Blue or the Head & Shoulders selenium sulfide one would likely work the same).\n\nI wash my hair every other day, or sometimes every third day if I’m super busy (the longer I wait, the worse the seb derm gets obviously). But, since I have curly hair, styling takes a bit of effort and I’m trying to avoid drying my hair out too much. I *always* wash my scalp twice, I usually will use Odele Clarifying or Super Sensitive Shampoo, or Trader Joes Tea Tree shampoo first. I think Vanicream shampoo would probably work well as a first cleanse too. Then, after rinsing that completely, I go in with the medicated shampoo. I’ve been rotating between the zinc shampoos (Happy Cappy or Zinc bar) and Davine’s mostly, and occasionally still use Nizoral… just hoping that none of them stop working completely. I try to let the medicated shampoo sit on my scalp for at least 5 mins, if not more, but also not too long since I don’t want to destroy my hair. \n\nAfter letting the shampoo sit and rinsing, I then go in with Odele’s super sensitive conditioner (recent fave) or Nizoral’s Non-medicated Conditioner (not in picture) to bring some moisture back to my hair. Kinky Curly Knot Today also works well as a conditioner and is fungal safe I believe! I try to never sleep with wet/damp hair and never put it up unless it’s fully dry if I can. I will blow dry my roots first and then hair (with a diffuser) whenever I have time since too much moisture on the scalp is the enemy.\n\nThe thing that has made the biggest difference for me recently when nothing else seemed to be helping as much, especially with itching and flaking (I don’t have the thick plaques anymore thanks to the shampoos and drying my hair), has been Bulletproof C8 oil. Thank you to everyone on here for recommending it! I bought a bottle of that and some glass dropper bottles from Amazon so I can apply directly to my scalp. I massage it in and then leave it for a minimum of 30 minutes (maximum up to a few hours) before I shower— I’ve found that leaving it for a few hours works best. After I shower, I will apply it lightly behind my ears and on the nape of my neck (biggest problem areas currently). It’s a pretty thin oil so I don’t find it to be too greasy and it also makes a decent face moisturizer without clogging my pores! I know C8 oil doesn’t work for everyone and I avoided buying it for sooo long be because I didn’t believe it would work, but am shocked how effective it is for keeping symptoms at bay and reducing redness/flaking. I also apply it to a cotton swab and use it to gently clean and coat the folds of my external ear which has helped a ton with the thick plaques I get there (if I’m consistent with it). \n\nI agree with others on here that certain products can irritate it, so I try to use “clean ingredient” products and fragrance free where I can— if they do have parfum/fragrance, it’s ones that list the fragrance ingredients or specify fragrance safety (not sure how legit that is, but seems like it can’t hurt)… with Curly hair I need to use conditioner and styling products if I want to wear my hair down so I do what I can to reduce the risk of making it any worse 😅. If anyone wants some rec’s for styling products that don’t seem to irritate the scalp (or mine at least), let me know!\n\nGood luck everyone!",

The reason was the ~~acquisition of the Vichy brand~~ probably a portfolio reshuffle (thanks u/iswmuomwn for pointing into the right year of L'Oreal acquiring Vichy). The Vichy brand has a anti dandruff shampoo in their portfolio that is way better in terms of revenue. The Dercos product line with Selenium Sulfide is branded as a pharmacy product, not a fast moving consumer good.\n\nThe baseline is that the per 100ml price about doubled if you now buy the Vichy Dercos product with selenium. That is the reason why, if you were wondering. Vichy competes with Selsun in the pharmacy grade products. The only thing that one would need: the active ingredient, not a brand.",

Found some guy make a reference to it on here a while ago and looked into it. It's actually worked well for me for three months. It's the only non-steroidal product I've used that seems to be effective for prevention and reducing flare ups without obvious drawbacks. 9/10\n\n2) Selenium sulfide shampoo. Selsun blue/Head & Shoulders clinical. Seems to work better than nizoral for controlling the dry itchiness of the scalp in my case. Better scalp seems to mean better skin. 8/10\n\n3) MCT oil C8. Helps to soften plaques on the scalp and reduces their itchiness. Does not otherwise improve any symptoms. 4/10\n\n4) Red light therapy mask, dermalux. Very difficult to judge. I've had great skin days and bad ones whilst using the mask twice per day. I'm unconvinced that it actually makes a difference for sebderm but my skin tone is mildly better, maybe? Probably not worth the price for this purpose. 4/10\n\n5) Raw Honey. Another idea I got from here. Makes your face sticky. Kind of unpleasant to apply. Made absolutely no difference doing a 3hr mask daily for two weeks. Yes, I made extra extra sure it was the right type of honey. 1/10.\n\nLifestyle choices:\n\n1) More sunlight. Making a conscious effort to get more sunlight seems to be a huge factor for me. No products needed. Its not always practical because I live somewhere with inconsistent weather but still 10/10\n\n2) Cutting down sugars and gluten. Something I absolutely hate to do because I love both, but I cannot deny that the frequency of flare ups is much lower when I am avoiding bread and sweet goods like chocolate. Reluctant 8/10\n\n3) 'reducing stress'- practically an impossible ask, especially if sebderm is the cause of said stress. Still, there's always a noticeable improvement in symptoms when I am enjoying a period of good mental health. I just can't force that to happen and I don't know if anyone really can. 6.5/10\n\n4) Cutting dairy. No difference. 1/10.\n\nThanks for reading. There's still much more for me to try but as of right now I'm having a good period with a combination of the top ranked items, to the point where I have no visible sebderm for now. I'm sure many people can relate when I say that I'm not allowing myself too much hope even still, as products and changes that seem to work initially can randomly stop a few weeks later. ",

I’ve bought some head and shoulders with eucalyptus to see if my scalp can handle transitioning to something less harsh and somewhat normal in terms of shampoo. Ill rotate between head and shoulders and ketoconazole every week. If all goes well I’ll be trying hair regrowth shampoos. Already my hair feels so much better from not using the medicated shampoo. \n\nUpdate: It seems like the salt water soak may have done something after all. The itchiness slowly began to subside and i get an occasional small itch. But nothing too crazy. I’m still using the selenium sulfide and I’m eager to stop it. So before I throw myself into another flare up, whats some sulfate free shampoo and conditioner I can use that won’t feed the fungus? Also something to lightly moisturize my scalp? I need to move away from these medicated shampoos/dandruff shampoos. My hair loss has been atrocious and I really want to restore my hair with a new routine. I’m going to go through some of the comments thats already here for suggestions, new suggestions would especially be welcome though. Bonus points to any routine that benefits 2b/c fine hair. The more lightweight the better. \n\n24 y/o woman. So far I’ve tried “everything” for sebderm. Different shampoos, prescription dandruff shampoo, hypoallergenic conditioner, topical steroids, apple cidar vinegar soaks, and salt water soaks. \n\nI was really banking on the saltwater soak, considering how well going to the beach seems to clear up even my acne. I purchased dead sea salt, and soaked in it. Instead my scalp felt terrible. It was severely itchy once again, and my head is sore. It didn’t even clear up my acne. \n\nSo I’m trying to find a new solution to prescription dandruff shampoos. Dermatologists  are refusing to explore other options with me even though I’ve read an oral medication can be taken. I told them dandruff shampoo makes me lose my hair but they just suggested rogaine instead. (I’ve had this problem with dandruff shampoo a long time ago with a bad case of smelly dandruff) my hair looks terrible now and it keeps falling out despite me taking hair vitamins. \n\nAny suggestions? Whats your routine/medications you take? Any suggestions as to why the saltwater treatment went wrong? I’m at my wits end and if a dermatologist doesn’t help me I’m just buzzing my hair off. It’s going to look terrible.\n\nEdit: TY for the responses Y’all. I’m going to be trying many of the things suggested to me and I’ll update if anything works or I ultimately end up buzzing my hair.",

I got major cravings away first, but it was so worth it. Instead I now use a natural sweeter (called Stevia) for hot drinks, which can be purchased online. Several months later, now that the initial peak of the problem is over, I can add some back in but actually don't really miss it! No sugar = less food for the fungus, and less inflammation generally. \n\nIn addition to this:\n1) I use Daktacort kept in the fridge all around my hair line after a shower. I don't use this more than a few days in a month though, so that my skin doesn't get 'used to it'.\n2) Any time I sweat, I wash out my hair, in addition to regular showers, but not  too hot or harshly, because it is important to keep the skin's natural oils.\n3) I use a hair dryer thoroughly after every shower to make sure there is no dampness left for the fungus to enjoy. \n4) I keep my hair in a chin length bob to stop too much weight on my scalp. \n5) I change my bedding,  and especially my pillow cases often. Pillow cases every 4 days or so, rest of bedding once a week. \n\nAll of the above seem to have helped, but the lack of sugar is especially helpful. Hormones and stress also play a part.

Replace your pillowcase every two days, protect your stomach, eat well if you don’t do it it will affect you. There’s is a myth about this illness; a girl tell that to us; she went one of the best professors in the world for checking out this illness because she was suffering for years, the professor ask a question; do you use mirror; can you look at it; is there any problem with yourself and do you like yourself?She was not know that one of the first actors of this illness is lack of motivation and being self reliant. I realized lately this illness took me much; I could not even look at mirror because of do not want to see a beaten guy from this shit illness.

AM: COTZ Face Prime & Protect Tinted Mineral Sunscreen PM: Vaseline\n\nI got all of my new products in the mail this week, so I wanted to get started seeing how my skin responded to these products. I didn't pick my face during this period. I had several scabs and scars along my jawline, chin, both cheeks, and forehead from skin picking. Just before these new products came in the mail, I had picked my skin so much that my face was broken out in places I never had blemishes before. I had whiteheads, pustules, skin-colored bumps, and deep cystic pimples ALL over the places I picked. This was truly the worst I had ever seen my skin.\n\nMy skin loved all of the new products I ordered that were FA Safe, thankfully. During this period, the only product I had to get my skin used to was Malezia Acne Treatment gel, which made my skin dry, red, and irritated where I applied it. I followed Malezia's regimine guide on their website on what to do if it caused irritation and started using the contact therapy method by at first leaving it on my skin for a few minutes, then rinsing off. Apparently studies show that Benzoyl Peroxide is just as effective being on skin for 15 minutes or so. I worked my way to being able to leave it on my face during this period.\n\nSome of my breakouts got a little worse during this time, but I was seeing a huge bounce back in my skin moisture barrier. My skin was still healing from being abused by my skin picking. The only antifungal product I used during this time was the dandruff shampoo mask, and it helped a tiny bit, but not that much. I knew I needed to adjust my strategy by trying different antifungal treatments to see what would help get rid of the fungal acne for good.\n\nSkincare Routine 6/17/24-6/24/24\n\n1. AM: Malezia Purified MCT Oil           PM: Malezia Cleansing Balm\n2. Malezia Hylaronic Acid Cleanser: Splashed water on my face and massaged onto my face for 15-30 seconds. Rinsed off with water.\n3. Differin Witch Hazel Toner: Applied with a cotton round to my face and neck.\n4. Malezia 5% Urea Moisturizer\n5. Malezia Acne Treatment Gel (2.5% Micronized Benzoyl Peroxide)\n6. Antifungal Treatment. Rotated between:\n   1. Amazon Basics Moisturizing Dandruff Shampoo \\[Used as face mask for 5 min\\]\n   2. Ketoconazole 2% \n   3. Lotrimin Ultra \\[Butenafine Hydrochloride 1%\\]\n7. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n8. AM: COTZ Face Prime & Protect Tinted Mineral Sunscreen PM: Vaseline\n\nDuring this period, I received more products in the mail and incorporated the Malezia Cleansing Balm and 5% Urea Moisturizer. My skin loves both of these. All of the Malezia products were reacting super well with my skin and I saw an overall huge improvement in the brightness and moisture in my skin. The acne and antifungal treatments were starting to ease up a tad bit more. I did have some more purging during this time, but my existing blemishes weren't getting worse, so I took that as a good sign. At this point I found that Sulfer products really helped others clear their fungal acne quickly, so I ordered the mask and face wash to see if these worked better.\n\nSkincare Routine 6/25/24-Present\n\n1. AM: Malezia Purified MCT Oil           PM: Malezia Cleansing Balm\n2. Malezia Hylaronic Acid Cleanser: Splashed water on my face and massaged onto my face for 15-30 seconds. Rinsed off with water.\n3. Sulfur Grisi, Facial Wash and Cleanser \\[Antifungal Treatment 3% Sulfur\\]: Massaged onto wet face for about 2-3 minutes or until it lathered very well,\n4. AcneFree Acne Clearing Mask, 3.5% Sulfur Acne Treatment: Applied to wet skin and massaged onto wet face for 1-2 minutes. Let dry completely then rinse off.\n5. Differin Witch Hazel Toner: Applied with a cotton round to my face and neck.\n6. Malezia 5% Urea Moisturizer\n7. Malezia Acne Treatment Gel (2.5% Micronized Benzoyl Peroxide)\n8. Antifungal Treatment. Rotating between:\n   1. Amazon Basics Moisturizing Dandruff Shampoo \\[Used as face mask for 5 min\\]\n   2. Ketoconazole 2% \n   3. Lotrimin Ultra \\[Butenafine Hydrochloride 1%\\]\n   4. Head and Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus \\[Pyrithium Zinc\\]\n9. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n10. AM: COTZ Face Prime & Protect Tinted Mineral Sunscreen or Sun Bum Original SPF 50 Sunscreen Spray                      PM: Vaseline\n\nThe sulfur face wash and mask were an absolute game changer. I also ordered a black light on Amazon to be able to tell if the fungal acne was actually getting killed off or not, and after only 2 days of using them, I BARELY have any fungal spots left. My skin texture and complexion haven't been this smooth in a long, long time. The amazing thing about how effective the sulfur treatment was that it combatted against both the fungal and bacterial acne I have. I'm slowly getting to the point of being completely blemish-free. Ever since I changed my strategy to attack the fungal acne harder, I did notice my skin is dry, red, and irritated after using the sulfur back to back, AM & PM.\n\nMy plan now is to let my skin rest from the super drying treatments and calm down. I'll continually check my skin with the black light so I can determine how often I need to do antifungal maintenance, since it's notorious for coming back and flaring back up after getting rid of it. I think I'm over the worst part of it all and I'm so happy about the results so far. I have dark spots all over my forehead, cheeks, chin, and jawline where I've previously picked at my skin, but they are slowly getting lighter every day. I know time will be my best friend on this next skincare goal (fading hyperpigmentation).",

I find my skin gets rid of about 2/3 of my acne on salicylic acid, but niacinamide - the few times I’ve used it - has made me red and irritated. I’m curious if this is just a “purge period” type of thing or if it’s unusual. \n2) Did you have any fungal acne on your shoulders/chest?

I was basically bleeding out every day with my pimples popping, and at first, all I did was clean, clean, clean. But it didn't work, so i finally went to see a dermatologist. They took samples and it showed that the it's a bacterial named **Staphylococcus aureus** (Staph). \n\nI did a full antibiotic regime daily antibiotics for a month (as recommended by derm) and herbal Medicine, I reduced carbs, sugars, and stopped drinking carbonate drinks. I worked out. While there was some level of improvement doing these, I couldn't cure it at first. The antibiotic regime made me severely allergic to eggs because it killed all the good bacteria. I drank Kefir every day to fix that, but it had some impact on it. \n\nI had a daily routine of having one towel for each day of the week to prevent cross-contamination between days. I know it's hard not to break the puss-filled pimples, but it is what you need to do to make sure you don't spread it to other hair follicles. (I've still continued this practice to this day)\n\nBut after I tried this treatment recommended by a different dermatologist, I am now officially folliculitis-free for three years. So, I thought I'd make an official post on what I did to get rid of this. \n\nThe new dermatologist gave me antibiotics for three weeks, but it was much less frequent, about 3 times a week. \n\nAlong with these, I used the selenium sulfide 2.5% with a Cetrimide BP 10% in the following schedule when washing my scalp\n* Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday - Zithrin 500mg Tablet contains Azithromycin, for 3 weeks\n* Monday, Friday - **Selenium Sulfide 2.5%**\n* Tuesday-Thursday, Saturday-Sunday- **Cetrimide BP**\n* After cleaning the scalp each day, I applied **Betamethasone Dipropionate Lotion** to individual inflamed points. Then applying fucidine 2% antibiotic cream\n\nThere are a few more points that might have influenced this result. \n\n* I moved away from a super humid region to a much less humid region. while there's no evidence suggesting location has an impact, I personally think it probably has some effects. Hot Humid environments promote bacterial growth. \n* Initially, I lived a quiet, stressful life, My stress levels had been drastically reduced after the first two years of having folliculitis. This may have also had some impact. \n\nThat's it, guys. It's Gone.... The pain that was there for 2 years was finally gone. I've used this, and it's 100% gone. I've never been this happy with the results of the folliculitis medicine I've taken before. Maybe this is a wake-up call to start a healthy lifestyle. \n\nI hope this helps anyone who is in need. I feel your pain, but there's hope after all. \n\nFeel free to message me if you need some advice",

I figured I would share the products I have discovered that gave me some relief regarding this horrid skin condition.\n\nLong story short, I have been suffering with CHRONIC (defined by me as a lot, stubborn, and never fully disappearing) Seb derm on my scalp for a little over a year now. Woke up one day and it literally was just there. My symptoms are a beat red scalp, smelly (it is yeast-like) hair, dandruff, hair loss, and itchiness / pain. I got a scalp biopsy to confirm that this condition on me is indeed Seb Derm. I have been in and out of derms, all with minimal relief. Before my recent findings, I put my faith in just the classics that are usually prescribed. I.e. ketoconazole, ciclopirox, selenium sulfide, flucinolone (probably butchered that) etc. Shampoos, lotions, all of the above with these ingredients have helped for only a few hours, and as the day progressed after using them, my red and flaky scalp returned. I have also tried Coal Tar shampoo, Selsun Blue 2% shampoo for dandruff, C8 MCT Oil, etc. Nothing had any lasting effect. Most did nothing. \n\nI recently have found relief with three products all made by the same company, and wanted to share what they are. This is not a sponsored post. I have been in this community for a while now and learned a lot about this condition. The education from this subreddit led me to these products. I simply want to share what has given me the first bit of relief I have experienced in a year. \n\n\n\n\nThese products: ALL FROM DERMAZEN. (This is the only company that has worked for me.)\n\n1. Scalp Therapy Shampoo \n2. Nourishing Conditioner\n3. Calming Seborrheic Serum\n\nAll titled exactly as I have put them.\n\nThey all can be found on Amazon. \n\nRoutine:\n\nApply serum at night. \n\nWash off in morning with the shampoo and conditioner. All need to be used together. Every night for best results but can be used every other day.\n\n\n\n\nA bit pricey but they have really worked for me. This past week since using them, my scalp has been white, feeling amazing, and sig less flaky. Haven’t seen it like this in over a year. No other changes to my skincare, diet, or environment. I am over the moon rn.\n\nThis post is not about the education behind them. I am just sharing what has worked for me, someone that has chronic seb derm. Best of luck to you all!",

    "body": "Hey everyone, I am a *21yo female (South Asian-American)* and I started the AIP (Autoimmune Protocol) Diet today (after a 24-hour fast) for the purpose of healing my scalp SD, and I'm determined to stick to the elimination phase of the diet for AT LEAST 3 months so I can get rid of all (or most) of my scalp SD. I've had SD on my scalp & consequent increased hair fall for around 5 years (ever since puberty, so prob due to hormones, but I also have been a chronically-stressed child \\[LOL\\] which could have harmed my gut, which definitely could have contributed to the SD).\n\nI've benefited (partially) from topical treatments like **medicated shampoos** (e.g. Selenium sulfide, 2% ketoconazole, Happy Cappy 1% zinc pyrithione) daily, **MCT oil** (this really DOES work, *wow*, but it clogs my hair follicles and makes me lose more hair, so I use it only during bad flare-ups - It would probably be perfect for facial SD...), the **keto diet** (slightly reduced SD but not as significant as I would like. Although, I would def recommend trying it as a lot of people had success with it), and letting a **sea salt spray** sit on my scalp for 15 mins before rinsing it out -- However, both ended up drying my scalp out too much & causing more hair fall. Unfortunately, I lost more than half of my thick, curly black hair during that period of time. :(\n\nAs I also have mild anxiety/depression (to alleviate this I take 400mg Mg Glycinate, B1, B12, fish oil, L-theanine powder \\[for anxiety\\], sleeping well, intermittent fasting (16:8), eating a Mediterranean diet, exercising daily, and taking cold showers in the mornings), I figured I must have **leaky gut**/gut health issues that could be contributing to the SD. After all, *SD is an autoimmune condition* which means it ultimately results from a disturbance in the gut from what I'm learning. (I will be getting a GI map done soon, but I think the AIP diet is the way to go to identify those food-based triggers to my SD. The way I know it's food that's affecting my SD is bc when I eat dairy, gluten, and added sugars, my hair falls out a LOT more- 200ish per day, vs. 70-80 per day.)\n\nI'm hoping to bring my hair fall count from 80/day to a much lower number - Then I can start to grow my hair back (A very slow process).\n\n**It'll be a difficult feat, but I wholeheartedly believe I can do it. And if I can, you can.** But that's for later :)\n\nI will keep you guys updated on any symptom reduction I experience as I stick to this diet over the next few months. Feel free to let me know if you have any advice or have questions for me about anything SD or gut health-related!\n\nMy credentials: A pharmacy student and SD warrior who's done a lot of research & experimenting :)\n\n**TLDR: Starting AIP Diet for scalp SD, will update if any changes over next few months**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** It has been an incredibly long journey and I have made many discoveries over the past few months. First of all, starting the AIP Diet (including cassava/meat/organs/bone broth) caused the following: Diarrhea, fatigue, toxin build-up, egg odor in stools, anxiety -- All with no change in SD or hair fall. I continued  the elimination period for 2 months to see if things would get better, but they only got worse. I  thought, *hey, AIP isn't working, maybe it's time I try reintroducing foods, what do I have to lose*. So one day, I tried an almond, and instantly experienced stomach/intestinal gurgling, slight dizziness, and muscle weakness in various areas throughout my body. *Oh, I must have an almond sensitivity*, I thought. I then tried a walnut- Even worse reaction to that. I went back to strict AIP for a few days, then tried a whole bowl of quinoa at a restaurant (it used to be one of my staples a year ago), and had some increased SD instantly (oil oozed out of my scalp, instant hair fall), some anxiety/low mood, and general joint pain/muscle weakness. *Odd*. I thought, *enough is enough, I'm going to see a naturopath and get help ASAP*, because clearly I need it...\n\n\\--> Fast forward 2 months and I am seeing a functional medicine doctor to figure out the underlying cause of my gut issues. Over the past 2 months (after trying the quinoa & having that reaction), I started having a mix of diarrhea & constipation, odor in stools, weight loss (lost 15 pounds from January-May 2022), fatigue, malabsorption (iron deficiency despite iron-rich diet), and worsened food intolerances (histamine & oxalate intolerance). I can now only eat a VERY LOW histamine/oxalate diet of fresh meat (full cuts of beef, lamb, chicken, shrimp, organs) & some low FODMAP veggies (zucchini, squash). My SIBO Breath Test results were negative for Hydrogen & Methane SIBO, and I'm currently waiting for my GI MAP test results (checks for gut dysbiosis, SIBO, parasites, etc. aka ANYTHING that could be causing my leaky gut). If the GI MAP comes out negative and there is no bacteria or anything causing the leaky gut, I assume it will just be a matter of healing my leaky gut. The histamine intolerance is caused by the fact that my DAO (an enzyme on the gut lining that breaks down histamines in food) levels are so low so my body isn't able to tolerate additional histamine-containing foods. Taking a DAO supplement before meals higher in histamine if ever has been helping. But guys, ultimately, the cause for my HAIR LOSS is the SEB DERM, and the SEB DERM is caused by the histamine intolerance. I have finally figured it out. And the histamine intolerance is caused by the fact that my gut is damaged, and the reason for THAT is what I'm going to figure out using the GI MAP test. The reason I realized it's the histamine intolerance is that when I'm having those histamine reactions, I lose a bunch more hair and I can feel my scalp flaking much more and my scalp oozes with oil. It's not the shampoos, it's not the MCT oil, nothing. Sure, those things will help with the SYMPTOMS of the seb derm. But to get to the end of this problem, to get rid of the seb derm once and for all, you must figure out what the internal problem is. When I take supplements like Quercetin that help stabilize my mast cells and reduce that histamine reaction (a histamine reaction happening at a very small, unnoticeable level with no outright symptoms could still cause seb derm, so addressing your gut issues is crucial), my scalp calms down completely and I shed like a normal person.\n\n**TLDR**: Figure out what is going on in your gut and heal your gut to heal your seb derm!\n\n:) Get a GI MAP test/SIBO Breath test/other relevant testing done through a functional medicine doctor (only costs a few hundred, which seems like a lot but I promise it's better than spending even more $ on treating the symptoms only to probably have the seb derm pop up again lol). My plan moving forward is to stick to a non-dairy carnivore diet (Thousands have cured ALL of their health issues by going with this ancestral way of eating. See the YouTube channels of Paul Saladino/CarnivoreMD, Steak and Butter Gal, etc. for more on this highly nutritious way of eating). I've been on a beef, salt, and water diet for the past two weeks and I already feel so much more energetic, my depression/anxiety has lifted loads, and I am sure that if I use this as one method to heal my gut, in a few months to a year or so, I will be free of all my health problems including seb derm. I've also been taking goat colostrum powder to help heal my leaky gut, but I need to see if there is an underlying cause for the leaky gut. And with all the nutrients in red meat/organs, I will easily be able to grow back all the hair I lost. I believe that wholeheartedly. Good luck, everyone! I will keep you updated about my GI MAP results and how I am going to proceed with my treatment if anything comes up on it.",

I don't know if this can help you and everyone is different but if your sd is linked to your diet it could well be the same cause as me: candidiasis (abnormal/massive growth of yeast in the intestines which  turn into mushrooms).  Otherwise I have SD in the scalp and face and I manage to manage my hair (I was losing it massively and now I no longer lose my hair and dandruff is rare).  What I do is first wash my hair with a very mild shampoo (dercos dermatological anti-itch shampoo for normal to oily hair) and then I coat my entire scalp with a lotion that I prepare (take a  one liter bottle of mineral or spring water, remove a quarter of it and put unpasteurized apple cider vinegar and then add 5 drops of tee trea, 8 of palmarosa + 8 of rose geranium) leave everything on for 30 minutes  then rinse and voila the scalp could no longer and the scalp becomes healthier again.  For my face unfortunately I can't yet master it as well as I would like but TCM oil works wonders as you say so well!",

        "body": "I would be very interested in hearing about your progress! I can't tell you how much this post mimics my own experience and personal findings. Unfortunately, I had a comprehensive stool test done, which showed nothing...not even dysbiosis...but a previous stool test from my conventional gp just a month earlier noted that I had \"many yeasts present.\" From my readings, it seems that many with seb derm really do have an overgrowth of Candida. Even though malassezia and candida are two different yeasts, it seems that there is some immune cross-reactivity there. \n\nI also have noticed the relationship between histamine and hair loss. It is directly linked for me. I am taking it a step further and am wondering if this condition is a symptom of mast cell activation for some. It gets really, really complicated, but like you said, the goal is to find out what the root problem is. Are you having any luck?\n\nAlso, do you know if you have a hormonal imbalance?",

    "body": "Dear reddit, I wanted to say thank you for the advice that this subreddit has given me by giving an overview on the approach, cheap easily accessible products and solutions I found worked for me after struggling with sebderm for 8 years. I thought this would also be extra helpful for Europeans and people in Germany in particular since a lot of the guides and products are based in the US, but less guides exists in the EU context.\n\nSo I've now been free of seb derm issues for the last 8 months after having struggled with it since teenage years. I would start out with saying that for me personally, and from what ive read, the biggest culprit to my condition was eating too much quick carbs, mostly sugar - which triggered the Seb Derm more than any other factor. However, nobody really likes to hear that they have to give up eating sweets forever, and neither did I. So, I can now safely say that I have been able to find an approach that allows me to eat the occasional sweets and be a bit lazy with my diet without having to worry about seb derm attacks. So, this is my routine:\n\nFor checking ingredients in products that feed the malassezia, check: folliculitisscout, it is more updated than sezia.\n\nFor Hair:\n\n1. Use one 'normal' schampoo that you can use regularly, that is gentle but that also does not have any ingredients that feed the malassezia. I currently use:\n\nAlkmene My Tea Tree Oil Anti Dandruff Shampoo (6 euros at Kaufland)\n\nAveda rosemary mint shampoo (8 euros amazon)\n\n2. ROTATE between different Seb Derm active ingredients schampoos whenever you start feeling the beginnings of an outbreak, or whenever you feel just a hinch of an sebderm itch. It is very important to alternate between the different products like zinc pyrithione, salicilyc acid, Ketoconazole, ciclopirox, selenium sulfide etc... for your SD to avoid resistance building up. At the same time, since these chemical ingredients are not fantastic for your hair in general, you want to avoid using them too regularly since it will dry your hair out most likely. I use three different products and rotate them:\n\nSelsun Blue Naturals Dandruff Shampoo Moisturising (Selenium sulfide) (24 euros amazon 325ml)\n\nKETOconazol Klinge (ketoconazole) (8-15 euros apotheke)\n\nStieprox Intensive Shampoo (ciclopirox) (11 euros amazon 100ml)\n\n3. Conditioner: in case you wanna use a conditioner: I found only two conditioners available in germany without ingredients feeding malassezia:\n\nPantene Pro-V, Repair & Care Pflegespülung (5 euros rossmann)\n\nBasler Tea Tree Oil Conditioner Bottle 200 ml (7 euros amazon)\n\n4. Styling, ideally you wanna avoid styling products if possible, but if you are like me and you are a curly freak and self conscious without some hair styling then I can recommend:\n\ngot2be Schaumfestiger Lockmittel Locken Mousse (5 euros rossmann) - does not have any active ingredients feeding the malassezia.\n\nFor facial skin:\n\nSkin routine (face): I reccomend using one cleanser, and then a moisturizer and potentially some beneficial serums but this is not necessary. These cerave products that i use are free from malassezia feeding ingredients:\n\nCeraVe Moisturising Hydrating Facial Cleanser (15 euros amazon 240 ml)\n\nCerave - Moisturizer for dry to very dry skin (11 euros 180 ml amazon) (theres also the morning version of this that has an SPF too)\n\nFor other pure suncreens, this one is SD safe:\n\nsunozon Classic Sonnenmilch LSF 50 (rossmann 3 euros)\n\nFoods and supplements:\n\nIn terms of foods i found that eating lots of probiotics, helps greatly (plus generally very good for you!). Stuff like: greek fat yoghurt, kimchi, tempeh, miso, sauerkraut, oats, cottage cheese, olives etc. Otherwise general healthy diet improves your Seb Derm drastically (reduce sugar and quick carbs)\n\nIt might be beneficial to take some extra supplements if you are like me sometimes a bit bad with your diet. I dont take these super regularly, just ocassionally when I feel like I have been a bit lazy or when I noticed that my diet was missing out on something - or after excessive berlin partying :D or festivals.\n\nD3, k2, magnesium, fish oil, B12, ocassional zink.\n\nAnd at last, change your pillow cases regularly! This in order to avoid seb derm flakes that might stick to your pillow to reinfect your hair again.\n\nThat is it! Feel free to add products available in Germany that fits this bill, always happy for more suggestions, especially cheaper ones too.\n\nHave a nice day and fuck sebderm",

(Will last awhile, as you don't use much of the shampoos as a little bit after a pre wash will lavour up a lot. \n\nHead and shoulders standard shampoo,\nKetoscalp ketoconazole and zinc pyrithione shampoo,\nSelsun selenium sulfide shampoo,\nAveeno conditioner oat milk blend (fungal safe)\n\nPre wash you hair using head and shoulders, rinse then apply either ketoscalp or selsun (all over scalp and hair) leave for 5 minutes and rinse, then use Aveeno conditioner and leave on for 2-3 minutes (only the ends) rinse and your done! \n\nWhen rinsing after the anti fungal always use fresh water! Don't use the bath water, if you use a shower it doesn't matter lol.\n\nBathing every two days you will alternate between selsun and ketoscalp. \n\nBy following this I find you will nuke the fungus by three different anti fungals properties (zinc, selenium and ketoconazole), alternating them every wash not allowing the fungus to build a resistance to either one. Use them every wash until the first month or two is up (two better)  then starting using them every other wash (washing just using head and shoulders and conditioner)\n\nYou want to use it every wash at the start to nuke/speed up the recovery process.\n\nThe reason you pre wash is because it rids most  of the oils allowing the anti fungal shampoos to lavour up much easier. \n\nMake sure to dry your hair (hair dryer) and not allow it to sit wet for extended periods \n\nAlways make sure to lavour your scalp AND all your hair. On the bottle it says to only use it on your scalp. But using it on all your hair kills all the fungus. ( I have used it like this and experienced no hair damage or dryness ) If yours does just use the conditioner once every so often on all your hair to replenish it. \n\nKeep this routine up and after 4 months or so I tried using normal washes and using the anti fungals now only every week or two. Since starting this treatment I haven't had a recurrence for 6 months! \n\nRemember to use this with other things like changing pillow case every few days (at the start I used old t shirts as pillow cases and changed it everyday) \n\nI also tried cutting out dairy and gluten as much as possible for a month at the beginning (I may have helped as dairy is bad for Seb Derm) Gluten could also be a issue causing it to come back often. (You don't have to do these) I believe the routine I have written will help regardless. \n\nI have had no symptoms since after the first month and I hope won't see it return again. (With regular maintenance) I believe it has got rid of it altogether ! But we shall see. I used to get it every other week so. Going well!! \n\n\nI hope you all do well and have patience and love for yourself when dealing with hard times, especially with Seb Derm! \n\n",

    "body": "So tired of this condition draining all my energy, so I’m taking matters into my own hands as no derm recommendation has helped. After reading basically every single post ever on this sub, I think the approach with greatest probability of success would be as follows, but please tell me if I’m missing something: \n\n1. Disrupt the Biofilm\nThe biofilm is a protective layer that microorganisms, including Malassezia (the yeast involved in seb derm), form to protect themselves. To disrupt the biofilm, you can use:\n-Salicylic Acid: This helps to exfoliate the scalp and remove the scales and biofilm.\n-Benzoyl Peroxide: It can be effective in breaking down biofilm and has antimicrobial properties.\n-Urea: Acts as a keratolytic agent and can help break down the biofilm. \n\n2. Use Antifungal Treatments\nOnce the biofilm is disrupted, antifungal treatments can be more effective. Consider using:\n-Ketoconazole: A strong antifungal often found in prescription and over-the-counter shampoos.\n-Ciclopirox: Another effective antifungal agent.\n-Selenium Sulfide: Reduces Malassezia and has anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n3. Heal the Skin Barrier\nAfter addressing the fungal aspect, focus on healing and maintaining the skin barrier:\n-Moisturizers: Use non-comedogenic, fragrance-free moisturizers to soothe and repair the skin.\n-Barrier Creams: Products containing ceramides and hyaluronic acid can help restore the skin barrier.\n\nKey Ingredients for Barrier Repair\n-Ceramides: Essential lipids that help restore the skin barrier.\n-Hyaluronic Acid: Attracts and retains moisture.\n-Niacinamide (Vitamin B3): Helps improve the barrier function and reduce inflammation.\n-Glycerin: A humectant that draws moisture into the skin.\n-Urea: Provides hydration and helps to exfoliate dead skin cells gently.\n\n\nCommon recommendations I saw of scalp-friendly moisturizers and barrier creams\n-CeraVe Healing Ointment:\nContains ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\nSuitable for use on the scalp, particularly in small, affected areas.\n-Eucerin Original Healing Cream:\nContains glycerin and petrolatum.\nCan be used sparingly on the scalp to avoid greasiness.\n-Vanicream Moisturizing Cream:\nFree of common irritants, suitable for sensitive scalp areas.\nUse sparingly to avoid build-up on the hair.\n\n\nIt is true that certain ingredients in shampoos and other skincare products can exacerbate fungal issues. Ingredients that are known to feed Malassezia include:\nFatty Acids: Such as oleic acid, which is found in some oils.\nEsters and Polysorbates: Often used in emulsifiers.\nFungi-safe Ingredients: Look for products that avoid these ingredients. This is where websites like sezia come in clutch. \n\n\nAdditional tips that seem to work for some:\n-Dietary Changes: I believe the best approach is finding if you have certain intolerances or deficiencies, and starting from there.\n-Stress Management: Stress can exacerbate seb derm, so learning ways to cope with stress may be beneficial. \n-Sunlight: effectiveness seems to vary form person to person but sunlight may possibly play a role in managing seb derm as the UV light from the sun has anti fungal properties that can reduce the proliferation of Malassezia. Sunlight stimulates the production of vit D which has anti-inflammatory effects.\n-MCT c8 oil: Can’t really find much scientific evidence outside of Reddit, but a lot of users view this as the holy grail. Has anti fungal and moisturizing properties that help reduce symptoms, is non-comedogenic and may aid in repairing and maintaining skin barrier\n-Keeping scalp as dry as possible: blow-drying with cold air to prevent fungus from thriving in damp environments.\n\nThoughts on this? Are there more effective approaches?",

I use whey protein and it's super bad as my SD is blooming and going to places it never went before. So I recommend going to vegan protein instead.

        "body": "I cleared up my sebderm even after antibiotics, steroid creams, selsun, nizoral all failed. I believe my seb derm is triggered by hormones and mine was suuuuper bad during puberty, pregnancy and postpartum/nursing. As a teen I was prescribed minocycline and it totally cleared it up and I didn't have a flare up for years. It returned within the last two years during my pregnancy and I was desperate to find something that worked and was safe for nursing. I was prescribed a different antibiotic which actually made it worse, and my drs wouldn't prescribe anything else because I'm nursing still - I even went to a dermatologist and he was zero help. \n\nMy current routine has completely cleared my seb derm up and we are still going strong for about 6 months now. I stopped using all my skincare and repaired my skin barrier first. Use water or gentle non irritating cleanser and creams to repair and hydrate if you have inflamed/raw skin. Now on my face the only thing I use is oxy emergency acne cleanser at night, and cerave moisturizing cream (sezia safe) morning and night. I have added pure lavender essential oil to the moisturizing cream and this seems to be the gamechanger. I also use la Roche posay anthelios ultra-fluid SPF during the day - this does not seem to make my skin any worse. For my scalp I use Pantene pure clean & clarify shampoo (I'm sure anything free of fragrance, silicones, parabens, dyes would do the trick) and I have added rosemary oil to the bottle. I let the shampoo sit for a few min before rinsing out. \n\nSince using this routine I haven't had a single flare up, my flakes, bumps, dry and itchy patches have completely disappeared. My doctors and I are actually shocked LOL. This seems to make sense if seb derm is caused by fungus/staph. Benzoyl peroxide is a great antifungal/antibac. I was previously using cerave salicylic acid cleanser but I found it wasn't as effective (and actually made my skin burn more). The rosemary and lavender oil also make sense as many studies have shown them to be great at combatting staph! Some people swear by tea tree however I found it to burn too much. \n\nGood luck and I'd be interested to hear if this works for you too!",

I wanted to share some of the information I learned in an immunology class at Stanford that really helped my understanding of whats going on. This is a moderate amount of science and maybe without a background on it, it might be difficult to follow. Though, if you have questions please leave a comment. Im going to wrap the science into a conclusion that supports the hypothesis that mushroom consumption can greatly impact your skin conditions.\n\n\nIts important to mention that Malassezia microbes vary in their pathogenicity based on which type and where. For most people these organisms are commensal (This genus of microbes/fungi accounts for over 90% of the organisms on your skin).\n\nThough, in some people(3-5%) of the population, these microbes are pathogenic. This is especially true for immunocompromised people. So, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, HIV/AIDs, stroke and TBI survivors... (to name a few common ones)\n\nAs lipophilic microbes, they’re going to cluster in your sebaceous glands. Though, this is not the interesting part. Typically, fungi have incredible means to evade the immune system and produce superficial and systemic infections. This may explain why your seb derm literally never goes away. \n\n Malassezia produces a biofilm through cell surface hydrophobicity and precludes the yeast cell from being phagocytosed. This is a complicated battle between your immune system and the bacterias that live on you. A neurotypical human with a fully functioning immune system is usually capable of defending the integument and this conversation is of no concern. \n\n(This next part is extremely trunchated) \nThe immune system deals with microbial overgrowth with direct cellular contact (nk cells/macrophages/etc) where these cells display dectin 2/mincle proteins as well as other members of the c-lectin family. These proteins are associated with lymphocyte activity and induce the adaptive immune system. \n\nConsequently, our immune system interacts with these pathogens through indirect cellular contact as well (cytokines/interleukins)\n\nInterleukins, stimulate the proliferation of T cells and lymphokine activated killer cells. Some closely associated Interleukins (IL1,2,4,13,14,15,33) Essentially these signaling molecules regulate the inflammatory response and recruit the immune cells that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of your skin and fighting pathogens.\n\nFor someone with a compromised immune system, this becomes the central issue in treatment and why seb derm is often recalcitrant. \n\nWhen I first saw a doctor for this, it was because a barber told me that I have ringworm, in reality it was my first real flare up of seb derm after a serious head injury. The doctor told me to put head and shoulders on on my face. Nice. \n\nFor someone with standard dandruff which is essentially just standard cell sloughing and can be easily maintained with specific proper hygiene. \n\nSEB DERM IS NOT SUPERFICIAL. This is a result of a dysfunctional immune system. Constant use of head and shoulders drys the fuck out of your hair but doesn’t really treat the seb derm. Though, the topical approach is immensely helpful for mitigation and control of symptoms. It really isnt addressing the problem. A combined approach is better.\n\nIf your seb derm is not responding well to shampoo on your face, and you are here looking for answers. There isnt an easy one. Though, whats worked for me, I think is universally applicable and beneficial. Ive also not met any doctors or read any posts that talk about the true role of diet in seb derm. I dont mean just cutting out dairy and processed fats.\n\nDisclaimer, if you are taking warfarin or other immunosuppressants. You should speak with your doctor first. Also, Im not a doctor. So, do your research and come to your own decisions. The advice I have here is advice that I made for myself and what has significantly helped to treat my own persistent AD.\n\nBut, mushrooms yo. Mushrooms are the single greatest food you can eat to support your immune system because of their role as adaptogens. There have been an incredible amount of studies done on mushrooms and their role in regulating various atopic dermatitis conditions. One reason for this is that they regulate helper T cells. \n\nIf you have neurological dysfunction, you can probably bet that there is a component of dysfunctional T cell activation. \n\nHere are a few of the many types of mushrooms that help\n\nReishi supplements (reishi tastes fucking inedible so typically its sold as an extract) provide benefits to T cell activation, mitigate itching, reduction of excoriations and lichenification on the skin.\n\nRieshi mushrooms also stimulate the mTOR pathway that is the primary regulator of cell survival and growth. They did a study on rats with cancer and the rats that were treated with reishi had ~50% reduction in tumor size\n\nTree oyster mushrooms stimulate Interferon Gamma, and INF‐γ is the primary activator of macrophages but also stimulates NK cell and neutrophils. \n\nLions mane mushroom it fosters the production of the bioprotein nerve growth factor and the myelination on axons. The NGF is one of the major molecules that regulates cholinergic receptors that are responsible for Alzheimer’s disease when they degrade\n\nWhite button mushrooms bind to monocytes that would normally bind to molecules in our arteries causing elevated triglyceride/glucose  levels in the blood leading to diabetes. \n\nAlso, mushrooms contain ergothioneine, a compound that contains sulfur.\n\n“In addition to keratolytic activity, sulfur has mild antifungal and antibacterial activity. However, its precise mechanism of action is unknown. When applied to skin, sulfur is thought to interact with cysteine, present in the stratum corneum, to form hydrogen sulfide (2). Hydrogen sulfide can break down keratin, thus demonstrating sulfur's keratolytic activity. Pentathionic acid, which is toxic to fungi, is also formed by cutaneous bacteria as well as keratinocytes from topically applied sulfur (2). In addition, the keratolytic effects may promote fungal shedding from the stratum corneum (1). Sulfur has an inhibitory effect on the growth of Propionibacterium acnes as well as Sarcoptes scabiei, some Streptococci, and Staphylococcus aureus (3-5). This suggested antibacterial activity purportedly results from the inactivation of sulfhydryl groups contained in bacterial enzyme systems (5). Although data is sparse, sulfur may have an effect on Demodex mites”\n\n\nLiterally the list goes on. Id recommend googling a list of mushrooms, and then googling that mushroom + dermatitis, or mushrooms + cancer, or mushrooms + immune system. Then mix in a variety of these mushrooms into your diet daily\n\nAlso, some other things more effective than head and shoulders (selenium sulfide,  Zinc pyrithione/ salicylic acid) is sulfur. Sulfur shampoos are fucking magical for symptom relief and as well. \n\ntheres a brand called psoriasin that makes awesome stuff and their sulfur skin ointment keeps my face under control. Though, take a look at your diet and all of the other factors that boost your immune system. Get those T cells up, and get your life back",

Here is a quick summary of some of the key insights from the report they released on the 27.11.2024:\n\nThe Phase 2 extension trial of AZR-MD-001, a selenium sulfide ophthalmic ointment, demonstrated its effectiveness in treating meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) over a 6-month period. The study found that both 0.5% and 1.0% concentrations of the ointment significantly improved MGD clinical signs, including meibomian gland secretion and expression, and alleviated dry eye symptoms, as evidenced by reduced Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores. The 0.5% concentration showed particularly strong efficacy, with more participants achieving normal meibum secretion. Safety was generally good, with treatment-emergent adverse events  being mild to moderate and decreasing over time. These findings suggest AZR-MD-001 may be a promising new treatment for MGD, offering improvements in both signs and symptoms, with a favorable safety profile.\n\nKey outcomes that improved included:\n\n1. **Meibomian Gland Yielding Score (MGYLS):** Both the 0.5% and 1.0% AZR-MD-001 groups showed statistically significant increases in the number of glands producing liquid meibum, with the 0.5% group showing a 1.9-point improvement and the 1.0% group a 1.1-point improvement compared to vehicle at 6 months.\n2. **Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI):** The 0.5% AZR-MD-001 group experienced a significant reduction in dry eye symptoms, with a 4.5-point improvement in OSDI scores at 6 months compared to the vehicle group.\n3. **Meibomian Gland Score (MGS):** Significant improvements in meibomian gland secretion quality were observed, with the 0.5% AZR-MD-001 group showing a 4.7-point improvement compared to vehicle at 6 months.\n4. **SPEED (Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness):** Both treatment groups showed reductions in SPEED scores, with the 0.5% group showing a 2.3-point improvement at 6 months, significantly better than the vehicle group.\n\nLink to the publication: [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39613259/)\n\nLet me quickly put this into perspective for those who are not familiar with clinical studies. The requirements are very strict, if medication manage to perform that well without serious side effects, this is a real reason for hope! I hope this makes your day. It for sure made mine.",

Apparently it's a French pharmaceutical company  that made it and sold the recipe to an American company who are selling it for $145.\nIt's the only thing that keeps my seb derm at bay. Especially after a long sweaty workout. I recommend to gently wash your face with just water (don't scrub hard) it will just make it worse if you do. When you get back home, take a shower and use SebClair 100ML shampoo(works better than the cream) and it's now sold on Amazon which wasn't the case just a few years ago, but it's still around $20 which is a lot, but although it last me around 6 months, so not bad for the price. I'm pretty confident it will help you.",

I managed to get it under control by changing between 3 different actives,the order here represents their effectiveness,\"ketoconazol of course, selenium sulfide and zinc pyrithione\", the occasional use of steroid lotion on my scalp during attacks and use of salicylic acid scalp cleanser before shower to loosen up the flakes.\nOf course i had the same troubles as everyone with shampoos, losing efficacy after a while, dryiny my hair, thinning, shedding and even changing my hair texture i went from having loose waves to tight waves in the last 2 years.\nI was very unhappy about my hair health, it looked like i have to bargain between my hair health and scalp health all the time which was frustrating.\n\nAt the same time i had seb dem as well on my face in the typical zones- eyebrows, the sides of my nose, the sides under my moth and ear- and i was using steroid cream for that as well.\nOne day i decided to have a skin care routine as i am a female in my 30s , started moisturizing my face daily with urea cream + using some actives for aging skin and my seb dem vanished completely! My face is seb dem free for 9 months! So i thought what if i used a similar strategy for scalp moisturization as well and see?\nI started using the same urea and salicylic acid cream on my scalp, i would dilute it a bit with few drops of water to make it more lotion-y and massage it on my scalp in the morning and wash my hair with a REGULAR shampoo every 3 days and with seb dem shampoo once every 2 weeks.\n\nResults? I am seb dem free for almost 6 weeks! I had a one minor attack, scalp flaked a little but the flakes were loose to the point i can remove them by just combing through my hair. No big flakes stuck to my scalp, no redness, no crazy itching. During the attack i used scalpicin lotion as usual and the itching reliefed next day that i didn't have to use it for a course of 4 days like before.\n\nI won't tell the name of my product since i live in the middle east and probably you won't have it anyway, but Eucerin has a new urea lotion directed towards scalp moisturization that o can't have in my country but i guess it's available in Europe and the US. I would recommend this since it's designed specifically to use on scalp so i hope it doesn't make hair roots sticky.\n\nThis is my experience and i loved to share it as a new strategy to help us all!",

(you can use supplements but nutrition derived from natural sources can never be replaces , they are best for skin and you will glow from within)  \nAND BOOM - 90% of your skin problems will fade away , 70%..... if your skin is in really bad condition\n\n\\# skin care- if you are doing your diet properly all you need is - cleanser - toner - moisturizer (sunscreen in morning)  \nif your skin is bad due to hormonal disorder , you SHOULD consult a doctor , hormones can mess up more than just skin and you might find out when situations worsen.  \nif you are really busy ( a student or just usually busy) cancel out toner. moisturizer , sunscreen and cleanser is sufficient.  \nIf you live in really polluted areas (near industry or the pollution level is really high you need a deep cleanser OR double cleansing (oil cleansing first and and face wash later)\n\nsome natural skincare i do as an Indian (IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE)\n\ncleanser - gram flour (+ honey for dry skin) or deep cleansing using fuller's earth (NOT FOR DRY SKIN , ONCE AGAIN IM NOT A DERMATOLOGIST PLEASE DO PATCH TESTS OR MONITOR YOUR FACE AFTER USING)\n\ntoner- rice water cleanser (for all skin type)  \n\\- green tea (same)  \nexfoliation - gram flour and turmeric face mask exfoliate without scratching or chemical use ( just moisturize THOROUGHLY after that)\n\nmoisturizer - light weight non comedogenic oil in winters (for dry skin)  \n\\- deep moisturizing winter cream ( for oily and normal skin)  \n\\- light weight moisturizer in summers  \nvaseline's gonna grow your eyelashes ...... trust me , i tried and it worked  \nmask - rub aloe vera gel on your face (natural , market bought if not available)  \n\\- honey and cosmetic turmeric (not kitchen turmeric , or if cosmetic turmeric not available use a small amount of kitchen turmeric , patch test first)\n\nfacial hair removal - use cyperus essential oil diluted with carrier oil (non comedogenic) in ratio of 1:50 ml post waxing/threading for gradual but permanent hair removal\n\npeople with oil skin - moisturize thoroughly , your skin might be compensating by producing oil for lack of moisture\n\nYOU CAN REDUCE PORE VISIBILITY BUT NOT VANISH THEM WITH ANY AMOUNT OF SKINCARE !!!\n\nTry slugging once a week and see how your skin react to it\n\nfix acne-  \nneem for fungal acne  \ndeep moisture for sabaceaous acne  \n(i am not aware of any other acne tips , if you are please comment and i will update the post with your username)\n\n\\#workout plan\n\nstart slow - yoga , mild stretching , mild pilate , mild cardio etc - that's level 1 , you have to do each level atleast for 1 week  \nlevel 2- increase a little bit , add  some planks , some high impact , increase pilate session , a bit harder stretches  \nlevel 3 - start practicing split for flexibility (it's gonna take time) , do longer planks , longer cardio  \nrec video for it - [https://youtu.be/63bhMpFZnvQ?si=oHoPtghvddPLIrc6](https://youtu.be/63bhMpFZnvQ?si=oHoPtghvddPLIrc6)  \nlevel 4 - do more variety of cardio , harder stretches , longer Pilate sessions , longer planks and longer cardio  \nlevel 5 - now move on to whatever changes you want in your body (might not change your body 180degree but it WILL make you confident) , weight loss , weight gain , muscle gain ,toning whatever  \nfor weight loss of weight gain get a blood test done first , it can be due to hormonal mess up  \nweight loss- view dear peachie weight loss video , burn more calorie than consumed  \nweight gain - vice versa of weight loss  \nmuscles gain- view channel hybrid calisthenics  \ntoning- yt - vicky justize and hana milly\n\n\\#study  \nromanticize study  \nwatch Gilmore girls  \nwatch study with me videos (if possible) while studying  \ncandle trick - light a candle (smaller if you are just starting), grab your things (water , stationary , book and note book , coffee ) and study till the candle goes out , NO DISTRACTION WHILE THE CANDLE IS LIT !!!  \npomodoro method - split studies into short period of time with mini breaks in between -  \nfor eg- start with 25 min of focus and 5 min break , then gradually move on to 50 min of focus time and 10 min break  .science  has proven that people learn the best in short bursts of focus time  \ndopamine resensitization method- stare at a boring wall 5 or 10 min before studying (trust me) and then start studying with pomodoro method , during breaks go back to staring at the wall , this is going to make your brain so entertainment deprived that studying start feeling not so bad\n\nfor better understanding and retention - study right after waking up , even if you wake up at 7 or 8 or 9 , sleep with a book nearby and start studying right after waking up , even before brushing !!! our brain is at superhuman intelligence level right after waking up , proved ,so try the hardest subjects at that time, i can link details if demanded.\n\nalter ego method - practice having a trigger right before being super focused , maybe the trigger is going to a cafe/library to study , maybe it's getting ready before studying , maybe it is that scent of lavender , or maybe a small word or affirmation right before studying . once you master it , you are gonna get into focused mode whenever you pull the trigger\n\nand lastly your grades dont matter , it's your hardwork that matters the most , grades might not help you in long run but hardwork will help you always\n\n\\# mental health-  \ntake time to meditate , even if it is 5 min  \njournal your thoughts , do shadow work questions to understand yourself better  \npurse your hobbies , even if you are only free on weekends  , if you dont have a hobby......explore and find one  🙂🔪  \nwatch tam kaur's mental health videos , they have helped me a lot\n\n\\#diet-  \nnot much but 90% of your diet should be super healthy and nutritious and 10% can be whatever you want..............that's how you create a balance.\n\n\\#sleep-  \nfor a good night sleep , eat dinner 2 hours before sleeping  \nstretch to relieve tension before sleeping  \ndrink chamomile tea before sleeping  \nmeditate before sleeping  \nno screen 2 hrs before sleeping  \nif you have severe insomnia problem then take melatonin supplements after consulting a doctor  \nhere's how to increase melatonin production naturally- get exposed to sunlight for within an hour of waking up , if it's still dark , use get exposed to artificial light , and sleep in TOTAL DARK ROOM and low temperature  \nsleep early, wake up early  \nin india we drink tumeric milk 1 hr before sleeping for good night sleep\n\n\\#habits-  \nno fidgeting  \nno nail bitting or skin scratching or hair pulling  \nno mindless scrolling  \nstart daily workout , even mild stretching on sundays  \nwake up before 7 , 8 if it is sunday or breakday  \ndrink minimum 2 litres of water , 3-4 maximum , no more than that  \nconsistent and fixed sleep routine  \nstudy everyday even if it is small study session  \nshower everyday or atleast alternative days  \nno gossips  \nmind your own business  \ndetach yourself from negative situations  \ntake care of yourself EVERYDAY even if you feel horrible (ik , ive been there where even brushing your teeth is difficult but IT IS IMPORTANT , PUSH YOURSELF , DO IT EVEN IF YOU DONT WANT TO!!!)\n\n\\#makeup  \nwonyoung is kind , just like wonyoung , be kind and opt for cruelty free makeup brands  \nalways do patch test before using a new product  \nalways remove makeup with double cleansing, and never sleep with makeup on  \ndo it for yourself not for others\n\n\\# mindset-  \njust like wonyoung , stay unbothered , be kind and confident in yourself , have growth mindset and constantly keep improving\n\n\"what is your favorite thing about you\"  \n\"the fact that im am jang wonyoung\"  \n\\- wonyoung\n\n\"i will like to be born being myself even in next life\"\n\n\"no one is me,  \nthey can be smarter , prettier , more famous  \nbut they cant be me\"\n\n00100011 00100000 01101101 01100001 01101110 01101001 01100110 01100101 01110011 01110100 01100001 01110100 01101001 01101111 01101110 00100000 00101101 00100000 01110010 00101111 00100000 01001110 01100101 01110110 01101001 01101100 01101100 01100101 00100000 01000111 01101111 01100100 01100100 01100001 01110010 01100100 00100000 00100000 00100110 00100000 01110010 00101111 00100000 01110011 01110101 01100010 01101100 01101001 01101101 01101001 01101110 01100001 01101100 00100000 00100110 00100000 01110010 00101111 00100000 01101101 01100001 01101110 01101001 01100110 01100101 01110011 01110100 01100001 01110100 01101001 01101111 01101110 00100000 00001010 01110110 01101001 01100101 01110111 00100000 01101101 01111001 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101 01110011 01110100 00100000 01110000 01101111 01110011 01110100 00100000 01101111 01101110 00100000 01110010 00101111 01110011 01110101 01100010 01101100 01101001 01101101 01101001 01101110 01100001 01101100\n\n\\#inspirational people similar to wonyoung-  \nkazua  \nsong jia  \nthewizrdliz  \ntam kaur\n\nnote - i will keep updating more , this is all that came to my mind today, share your tips and i will update them with your username\n\n  \nu/4delia  thankyou so much for sharing these tips with us:-\n\nFor fungal acne - try washing face with anti dandruff shampoo as it probably contains zinc pyrithione or/and selenium sulfide or/and ketoconazole which has antifungal properties\n\nHigh porosity hair - focus on hydrating and moisturising and generally 'thicker' products and to retain moisture because your hair absorbs moisture quickly and also tends to lose it quick.

    "body": "Just wanted to share a win - I’ve now been clear for like a full month. I maybe get 1-2 very small spots on my forehead, but they go away in a day or two.\n\nI struggled with an FA breakout for about 4 months (end of Nov - end of March). I tried it all ketoconazole cream + shampoo, de La Cruz sulfur, head & shoulders, itraconazole pills, selenium sulfide, malezia BP + moisturizer, fully FA safe routine for months.\n\nAt one point I had about 30-40 whiteheads on my forehead…..\n\n\nStep 1\n-I had a gut test done - my results came back pretty terribly (I don’t have IBS though)..I had fungal + bacterial overgrowth that they thought  was affecting irritation across my body. \n\n-I started a routine to fully reset my gut which includes colostrum, better probiotics, oil of oregano, caprylic acid, etc \n\n-I started a routine to lower my stress levels as my cortisone was off due to stress specially at night \n\n-I lowered any gluten, sugar, dairy, alcohol, and caffeine intake to less than 10% of my diet. I try to follow a candida diet to best of my ability and maybe treat myself to something once a week\n\nStep 2\n-one final round of ketoconazole pills. I took 2 pills a day for 2 weeks, 1 pill a day for the next week. Have not taken any for over a week now.\n\nStep 3\n-skincare routine\n\nMorning - wash forehead with dermaharmony zinc bar, rinse rest of face with water. Followed by red stridex across entire face + forehead. Wait 30 minutes. Apply dermalogica calm water gel moisturizer on forehead, Biossance vitamin c serum + biologique recherche iso-placenta serum on rest of face, Biossance squalane gel moisturizer, elta md sunscreen\n\nNight - if I worked out at gym, wash forehead with ketoconazole shampoo. If not, use dermaharmony bar. Wash rest of face with vanicream gentle moisturizer. Red stridex across entire face + forehead. Wait 30 mins. Dermalogica calm water gel moisturizer + ordinary squalane oil on forehead, ordinary Hylauronic acid + Biossance squalane gel moisturizer on rest of face. If I have any active spots on forehead, I do an overnight spot manuka honey cover \n\n\nFor reference  - I work out 3-5 times a week and sweat a shitton. I also went to Coachella weekend 1 where I was sweating for hours etc and came back with NO breakout \n\n\nYou can get through this!!",

    "body": "For anyone out there struggling with dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis, I want to share my journey—because, honestly, this was the closest thing to a magic pill I’ve ever experienced. Looking back on how much pain and embarrassment this condition caused me, it’s almost surreal to take my now-healthy hair for granted. I have probably read every single subreddit regarding this in desperation on my journey, and to return the favor for the little bits that helped me along the way, I figured I would try and give back my experience and what helped for me…\n\nBackground: Over a year ago, my scalp started randomly becoming so itchy that I would scratch it until it would hurt, and I developed horribly dry flakes/dandruff. As a result, my black t-shirt heavy closet shifted to only white shirts to hide the flakes of dry skin and dandruff and I would plan out days that I would wear black shirts only after washing my hair so I could temporarily wear them. I tried countless foul-smelling concoctions of apple cider vinegar, strong essential oils, etc… leaving my hair reeking of vinegar for days. I went through bottles of Selsun Blue, niacinamide, ketoconazole shampoo, Head & Shoulders, selenium sulfide—none of it worked. In fact, most of them only made my scalp more inflamed, itchy, and dry, leaving my hair fluffy and stinking of artificial fragrances. \n\nThere wasn’t a day I didn’t seriously contemplate buzzing my hair off. I’d sit in class, purposefully making sure no one was behind me to see the flakes on my shoulders. I experimented with various essential oils like rosemary and Mielle, hoping for a miracle, but nothing changed. I was ashamed waking up and seeing the amount of flakes on my pillowcase. and I begged my parents to help me see a dermatologist. Since I lived away from home, I was never taken seriously, so I suffered in silence and continued to experiment with everything from no shampoo, to multi-stepped hair cleaning approaches.\n\nI tried everything. I bought a shower filter, changed my diet, and tried every product on the market. The real needle mover ended up being washing my hair with Egg yolk.\n\nSo in an act of pure desperation, I cracked an egg on my head in the shower. When I emerged with soft, shiny hair, I was shocked. Waking up the next day I was even more surprised to find that my scalp was the calmest it had ever been. The itching was practically gone, and for the first time in forever, there were barely any flakes on my pillowcase.\n\nCould it really have been this simple all along?\n\nAfter seemingly perfecting my egg-based concoction, my hair was healthier than it had ever been. Adding MCT oil and tea tree oil I managed to reset my scalp to the point where I only needed to wash my hair once every 1-2 weeks. In between washes I recommend brushing with a wooden comb, or boars hair brush.\nFor the past 8 months my hair has been great, with no itching and an amazing texture. It may sound crazy, but sometimes the most unconventional methods are the ones that actually work. So, if you’re in the same boat I was, you’re desperate and will try anything, so I highly recommend giving this a try. It changed my life and confidence so hopefully someone else can benefit as well.\n\n\nFor my mid length mens hair I used : 2 egg yolks, 1/4th tsp MCT oil (give or take), 2 drops tea tree oil\nI would dampen my hair in the shower, add the mixture to my scalp/hair and massage it in for a minute or so, then let it sit for 3-4 minutes while I wash my body and waited around for a bit, then rinsed it out. Remember not to do this with too hot of water or you may get scrambled eggs.\n\nBelow is the scientific reasoning behind eat ingredient, which I never thought too deeply about in the moment: \nEgg Yolk\nNourishing and Moisturizing: Egg yolk is rich in vitamins (A, D, E, and B-complex) and fatty acids that nourish and moisturize the scalp, which can be beneficial for dry and flaky conditions like seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis.\nProtein and Lecithin: Egg yolk contains proteins and lecithin that can help strengthen hair and improve its texture. This can be particularly helpful for conditions like tinea capitis and folliculitis, where hair health is compromised due to infection and inflammation.\nAnti-inflammatory Properties: The bioactive compounds in egg yolk can have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help soothe an irritated scalp affected by psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.\nMCT Oil\nAntimicrobial Properties: MCT oil, particularly those containing caprylic and capric acids, has been shown to have antimicrobial properties. This can help combat fungal infections like tinea capitis and bacterial infections associated with folliculitis.\nMoisturizing and Skin Barrier Protection: MCT oil can help maintain the scalp's moisture balance and strengthen the skin barrier. This is beneficial for preventing dryness and irritation seen in conditions like seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis.\nAnti-inflammatory Effects: The fatty acids in MCT oil have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce scalp inflammation and soothe irritation in conditions like psoriasis and folliculitis.\nTea Tree Oil\nAntifungal and Antibacterial Properties: Tea tree oil is well-documented for its antifungal and antibacterial properties, making it effective against tinea capitis and folliculitis. It can help reduce the microbial load on the scalp, preventing and treating infections.\nAnti-inflammatory and Soothing: Tea tree oil has anti-inflammatory effects, which can help soothe irritated and inflamed scalps affected by psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.\nSebum Regulation: Tea tree oil can help regulate sebum production, reducing the excess oil that can exacerbate seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nLong‑time lurker, first‑time poster. I’m a Vietnamese pharmacist who’s wrestled with seborrheic dermatitis for more than a decade—flaky scalp, red patches along the sides of my nose, and raw skin around my ears. The usual shampoo rotation—ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, oxalic acid—helped for a while, but the dryness, sulfur smell, and rebound itch kept coming back.\n\nLast year I stumbled on an r/SebDerm thread about pure MCT C8 (caprylic triglyceride).I started rubbing a few drops of straight C8 into my scalp and the stubborn facial patches every day. Within 2 days the itching calmed; within a week the flakes/redness around my ear and beside my nose were gone. Honestly, it felt like discovering fire.\n\n**The catch:** straight C8 is an oily mess—hair looks slick, pillowcases need daily washing, and it’s awkward if you have to run to a meeting right after. It also leaves my face shiny—great for selfies under oil‑painting filters, not so great in real life. I’ve been tinkering with lighter vehicles and reading up on **Propanediol Caprylate** as a potentially less‑greasy way to deliver the same punch.\n\n# Why I’m reaching out\n\n1. **Has anyone here failed with caprylic acid or even Propanediol Caprylate?** What went wrong—formulation, frequency, irritation?\n2. What’s your single biggest gripe with current medicated options (dry hair, smell, itch rebound, cost, etc.)?\n3. If you could fix *one* thing in a Seb Derm product for both scalp and face, what would rise to the top?\n\nI’m honestly excited—borderline obsessed—about turning this into something other people can use, but I’m also staring at a long road of formulation trials, stability tests, and maybe regulatory hoops. Any hard‑won lessons or “don’t waste your time on X” stories would be gold.\n\nThanks for reading, and mods, please flag me if I’ve crossed any lines—I’ll happily edit.",

I’m sure picking at the spots isn’t promoting healing for my scalp either. \n\nHas anyone found any strategies for keeping your hands off your scalp??\n\nFwiw the routine I’m currently trying is 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo daily (letting it sit for 10 minutes) and a malassezia-safe conditioner in the mornings, then liberally applying MCT oil (C8 and C10 only) and letting it sit overnight.

Paint your nails and take your time so while drying you will not be able to pick your head or touch anything. Try silly putty. Keep a keychain on your purse or jeans or wallet so you can distract your hands with that. Is there such thing as finger covers? I think Ive seen them before.

TL;DR - shaved my head out of desperation and realized just how bad it was, got very depressed. It’s a week later and I’m committed to sticking with these routines as I’m seeing improvement and feeling more hopeful. I even shaved my head again this morning prior to the pics below to compare apples to apples. \n\n[pics from week 0](https://imgur.com/a/vYLo7) \n[pics from week 1](https://imgur.com/a/dXD9j) \nEDIT 3/23/18: [Update from week 6](https://redd.it/86ned4)\n\nA few observations:\n*Overall, the scaling has drastically improved. You can really see this if you compare today’s vs. last week’s pre shower photos. \n*Overall, inflammation is down, and the spots are turning more “pinkish” than angry red. I know my post shower photos look angry, that’s because it’s usually inflamed from using products/washing. You can see how it looks most of the time by my before shower photo from today. \n*In addition to fading some, my patches are noticeably less “raised” from the rest of my skin. My skin feels flatter from a seb derm spot to an unaffected spot. \n*The area of some of my patches seems to be fading in towards the center. There’s a few small spots on the lower part of my forehead that have improved a ton. \n*Scabbing (which I presume was caused primarily from scratching my scalp before I cut my hair) is much improved, nearly gone. \n*Itching is significantly improved. I still have urges,  but it’s far far less frequent than before. Also, I’m not flaking all over my shoulders anymore. \n*Pain/stinging when washing or using apple cider vinegar on my scalp has significantly improved. Most of the time there’s no stinging at all. \n\nWhat I’ve been doing:\n*3 hour raw honey mask every two days. On off days, cleanse face with it and leave on face/scalp for 5 mins before showering. \n*In shower, I first use one of many shampoos to remove honey residue and deflake. I rotate between Coal Tar, Salicylic Acid, Selenium Sulfide, Pyrithione Zinc, Ketoconazole, and an unmedicated sensitive skin tea tree shampoo. I let it sit for about 5 minutes, then I use a scalp brush to scrub before rinsing with cold water. \n*Soak a washcloth in 1:3 raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar and hold it on my various patches for about a minute each.\n*Cold rinse\n*final step I did twice this last week was to use a coal tar or tea tree conditioner. \n*When I leave the shower, I apply various products to my scalp rotating: clobetasol solution, calcipotriene solution, ketoconazole cream, calcipotriene cream, hydrocortisone cream. Every few days I just put one more layer of ACV after showering and leave it at that. \n\nA few more things I think have helped (inspired by research or anecdotes from others):\n*Daily exercise - this is just good for my mental and physical health overall. Some have suggested sweating daily helps. \n*Daily sun exposure - often combined with my “exercise”, or sometimes satisfied by an afternoon walk if I exercised real early. Some have suggested that sun exposure has helped with their seb derm by killing yeast with UV r  ays. I make sure to get a minimum of 20 minutes of direct sun exposure in my scalp per day, and try to do so around noon time when the sun is highest. I make sure to walk weird zig zag routes so all angles of my dome get sun. \n*Forced exposure - this is a concept used in treating mental health issues which involves forcibly exposing yourself to your triggers/anxieties with the idea that anxiety reduces with repeated exposure. I have learned about it in treating my anxiety. I have held a lot of anxiety about others seeing my scalp. Forcing myself to get direct sun exposure requires me to walk around in the daylight where others can see me. I am feeling less stressed by others seeing it each day. Plus, it’s improving! I do wear a hat the rest of the time I’m “out” though 😼. \n\nA few things I’m considering experimenting with:\n*Getting the advice of a naturopathic doctor\n*Shaving my head to the skin rather than just buzzing it real short for better contact with my patches\n*Allergen testing\n*Elimination of alcohol, coffee, dairy, wheat\n*Light therapy\n*Blood work for immune system functioning\n*But since I’m already doing so much, I’ll save these avenues for if I plateau in the progress I’m seeing. \n\nYeah, I spend 1-4 hours per day doing things specifically to treat my seb derm. It’s an investment I’m willing to make to get to a maintenance stage. Healing this and my mental health are my #1 goals. I realize also I’m doing a ton of things at once. My philosophy is to keep attacking it from 1,000 angles until it gets to a point where I feel comfortable experimenting eliminating certain parts of my routine. For now, SOMETHING or SOME COMBINATION of things is working. \n\nHope this gives someone encouragement and hope today. You are all wonderful. ",

I just found out it got banned in europe and I can't import it anymore. I have tried contacting them and they are currently out of stock too so there is no way to get more.\n\nI have been trying other shampoos but all of them contain SLS or other irritants and dry my scalp out like crazy only making it worse. Selenium sulfide and salicylic acid don't work for me. I need something similar like free and clear that is produced in europe, maybe with piroctone olamine and no irrtants like SLS, fragrances, etc.\n\nI have an appointment at the dermatologist in 14 weeks to hopefully get ketaconazole again, eventhough last time it still left my scalp super dry and my hair super frizzy but atleast no sebderm.",

My eyebrows and scalp was always flaky and had a layer of skin deposit that I could scrape off. My clothes would look like it snowed on them. I tried to keep it under control using various off the shelf shampoos but they didn't really help significantly. Flareups would be bad, my skin would get red, itchy and would even bleed. I could wash my face, scrub for minutes and it would start to be flaky an hour after drying.\n\nOne dermatologist prescribed me Ketoconazole shampoo and that brought the flaking down a bit but it would cause my skin to crust real bad and then my face would be clear for a few  days and back again. I was also given Elidel ( Pimecrolimus ) and that was a bit like magic at first. It would get rid of the redness immediately and calm things down but didn't help in the long run (i didn't want to use it daily).\n\nRecently, I started getting flaking and red spots even on my neck and saw a different dermatologist who was finally able to help and I wanted to share what my routine was in case it helps anyone else\n\n* Fluconazole: 150 mg, once per week, for 4 weeks\n* Ciclopirox 1% shampoo: Use on scalp, face, neck daily for 2 weeks. Apply for 3 minutes before rinsing off. Once every 3 days or so afterwards\n* Econazole 1% topical cream: Use on face, neck, chest twice a day for 4 weeks.\n* I used no other cream/oil on my face during this time\n\nMaintenance:\n\n* Ketoconazole 2% topical cream: week 4-8. Apply once a day.\n* I cycle between Selenium Sulfide and ketoconazole shampoo on my face and scaly now that my ciclopirox has run out\n* I'm trying out squalane oil as a moisturizer now and it seems to not be causing any flare ups as far as I can tell.\n\nOther stuff:\n\n* Wash your pillow cover every other day for the first 2 weeks or so. I have a dryer with a steam sanitize function that I used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, after countless years of dealing with SD, my skin is finally back to normal with no signs of redness or flakiness. I had tried other things like oil cleansing my face and that helped reduce redness but would come back again after a few days. My theory is that SD would migrate from my scalp to the face or from other parts of the skin. This regimen sort of treated all areas at once and is probably why it worked for me.",

    "body": "**Background**: Got diagnosed with Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) when I was still very little; got it from my Dad. Doctor told me I got severe SD, got forced to take strong Corticosteroids (topical and oral) due to how bad it got. When I was younger I described my hair as \"snow world\" due to how much hair fall and damaged (inflamed, itchy, and *very* scaly) scalp.\n\nRight now, I haven't gotten severe dandruff in 2 years--probably some flakes here and there, but not that annoying or severe. My entire face and ears still gets scaly (due to weather and environmental conditions), but not to the point of bleeding or peeling.\n\n**Symptoms:** I get fungal acne (Malassezia folliculitis), (closed and opened) comedo, and all types of acne on the face and body, dandruff, very inflamed skin, with occasional bleeding.\n\n**Products:** I use different products for the hair, face, body, and the symptom that area is affected by.\n\nFor medications, I will put the generic name with its strength, then its brand name.\n\n# Fungal Acne, Comedo, and Acne\n\n**Face**\n\n1. **Differin 0.1% (Adapalene) or Tretinoin 0.05% (Retacnyl)**. *This is a retinoin.* Used five times a week at night (M, T, Th, F, St). Tretinoin is a prescription medication.\n2. **Ketoconazole 1% (Nizoral).** *This is an anti-fungal*. Used once a week at night (W).\n3. **Benzoyl Peroxide 2.6%** **(Cetaphil Gentle Clear Complexion-Clearing BPO Acne Cleanser)**. *This is an anti-acne*. Used once a week at night (St).\n4. **Salicylic Acid 2% (Cetaphil Gentle Clear Clarifying Acne Cream Cleanser).** *This is a chemical exfoliant.* Used once a week at night (Sn)\n5. **Sunscreen.**\n\n**Body**\n\n1. **Benzoyl Peroxide 5% (Differin Acne Face Wash).** *This is an anti-acne*. Used twice a week (M, F) for 2 minutes. After the bath, liberally moisturize the areas where BPO was used.\n2. **Ketoconazole 1% (Nizoral).** *This is an anti-fungal*. Used once a week at night (W, St) for 3 minutes.\n\n# Dandruff and Flaking\n\n**Scalp and Hair**\n\n1. **Ketoconazole 1% (Nizoral).** *This is an anti-fungal*. Used twice a week (T, F) for 3 minutes.\n2. **Zinc Pyrithione 1% (Head & Shoulders Bare).** *This is an anti-fungal*. For everyday (excluding Nizoral days) hair shampooing for 1 to 2 minutes.\n\n**Face**\n\n1. See (2) for *Fungal Acne, Comedo, and Acne: Face.*\n2. **Clotrimazole 10 mg and Beclometasone Dipropionate 250 μg (Candibec)**. *This is an anti-fungal and corticosteroid*. Apply only when needed on affected areas, not to be used for more than a week.\n3. **Miconazole nitrate 20 mg (Daktarin).** *This is an anti-fungal*.\n4. **Betamethasone Valerate 1 mg (Betnovate).**  *This is a corticosteroid*. Used with Daktarin as a last resort medication, for severe symptoms. Used only when Nizoral and Candibec don't work. Topically applied as a 1:1 pea sized mixture.\n\n# Skin Care, Shaving, Toothpaste, and Supplements\n\nThese are the following products I use as my skin care (excluding the medications I listed above).\n\n1. **Moisturizer (with Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide)**: Cetaphil Deep Hydration Skin Restoring Water Gel.\n2. **Oat Serum**: Aveeno Calm + Restore Triple Oat Hydrating Face Serum.\n3. **Mild Facial Cleanser:** Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.\n\nShaving really irritates my skin, and it really makes my skin get inflamed and start scaling very heavily.\n\n1. **Electric Razor**: Philips Norelco One Blade. A close shaving electric razor that doesn't have blades that physically touch my skin.\n2. **Shaving Cream**: Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. I use my mild facial cleanser as my shaving cream to avoid using other products on my face that might cause irritation or scaling.\n3. **Aftershave**: Differin Pore-Minimizing Toner with Witch Hazel. This has Witch Hazel, Aloe, and Chamomile to calm my skin down. I don't like using aftershave or splashes since it has strong scents and alcohol.\n\nUsing toothpaste also triggers scaling and (fungal and non-fungal) acne on my face. I found these toothpastes to work on me (I found mint-free toothpaste work). I use **Sensodyne Pronamel**.\n\nFor conditioner I use the **Nizoral Non-Medicated Deep Moisturizing Conditioner**.\n\nI also take a **One A Day Men’s Complete Multivitamin** every morning.\n\n# Routine\n\n**Face**\n\nSince I use a have a lot of products (I have but not *use* a lot of products). I want to determine what I want to attack for the day or week and use the specific routine for that symptom. Usually I'll prioritize flaking, bleeding, and inflammation; then, fungal, non-fungal acne, and comedo.\n\nIn the morning:\n\n* I wash my face with the gentle cleanser.\n* Shave (if needed)\n* Moisturizer\n* Sunscreen.\n\n>If I am not shaving, then I usually skip the moisturizer. If I have some flaking and/or inflammation, then I will put a *VERY* thin layer of Candibec.\n\nAt night, this is where the medications come in to play.\n\n* A usual day would be gentle cleanser, then oat serum, then Differin or Tretinoin, then moisturize.\n* If it's Saturday. I'd be using my BPO cleanser, then Differin, then moisturize.\n* If it's a Wednesday. I'd be using Nizoral as a cleanser, then moisturizing.\n* If it's a Sunday. I'd be using an SA cleanser, then oat serum then moisturize.\n* Regardless of the day, if there are flaking and/or inflammation. I'd be using my gentle cleanser, Candibec, then moisturize. The next day would a Nizoral day.\n\n# Sticking to things that work, leaving things that don't\n\nHaven't tried MCT Oil because I have already found products and medications that work well for me, and adding another step or product to my routine may change the \"stability\" of my SD.\n\nSelenium Sulfide (Selsun Blue) works well for me, but due to the side effects of hair loss (I already got hair loss as a symptom of my SD), Selenium Sulfide would just go in tandem with SD and make my hair loss severe.\n\nNow what your body needs, talk to other people with SD and to a dermatologist, and work your way to finding a routine that works for you. Doesn't mean something works for me or your dermatologist gave you a specific medication means that it will work for you.\n\nGone through 3 dermatologists, numerous treatments and operators. None of them worked, and that's not a bad thing.\n\n",

In a  Phase 2 clinical trial, AZR-MD-001 topical ointment (selenium sulfide, 0.5% or  1.0% concentration) was investigated as a new treatment for MGD. Changes in tear film stability, meibomian gland secretion and ocular  surface symptoms were monitored in adults with signs and symptoms of MGD.  \n \n\nMethods: For this multicenter, double-masked, vehicle-controlled,  parallel-group trial (NCT03652051), 245 adults were randomized to  receive treatment (AZR-MD-001 0.5% \\[n=82\\] or AZR-MD-001 1.0% \\[n=83\\]) or vehicle (n=80)  twice a week before bed. Eligible patients were ≥18 years old, had a Meibomian Gland Secretion (MGS) score ≤12 in both eyes, and an Ocular  Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score from 13 to 33, and TBUT <10 seconds. Prespecified co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in  Meibomian Glands Yielding Liquid Secretion (MGYLS) and OSDI score at month 3. Tear film stability was considered improved if tear breakup  time (TBUT; with 2% fluorescein sodium) increased by more than 2 seconds from month 3 onward. Patients were defined as asymptomatic if their OSDI  score was <13. Statistical differences from baseline were calculated for visit days 14, 45 (1.5 months), 90 (3 months), 135 (4.5 months), and  180 (6 months). Co-primary endpoints were evaluated using a hierarchical approach that controlled for family-wise Type I error,  using an ANCOVA model. Responder endpoints were evaluated via Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test using Wilson-Hilferty transformation. \n\nResults: AZR-MD-001 0.5% achieved statistically significant improvements  vs vehicle for both co-primary endpoints, MGYLS (p=0.0004) and OSDI  score (p=0.0438), at month 3, which continued through to month 6 (MGYLS:  p=0.0002; OSDI: p=0.0135). Tear film stability (TBUT) significantly increased from baseline in both treatment groups compared with vehicle  at month 3 (AZR-MD-001 0.5% mean change=2.2 s, p<0.0001 vs vehicle; AZR-MD-001 1.0%=1.5 s, p=0.0187 vs vehicle; vehicle=0.5 s),  with increases generally sustained at month 6 but no longer significant  vs vehicle (0.5%=2.3 s; 1.0%=1.3 s; vehicle=1.6 s; p>0.05 vs vehicle for  both concentrations). Many patients treated with AZR-MD-001 were considered asymptomatic for disease (OSDI <13) at month 3 (0.5%=47%,  p=0.0199 vs vehicle; 1.0%=38%, p>0.05 vs vehicle; vehicle=28%), which was sustained for the 0.5% concentration and improved for 1.0%  concentration at month 6 (0.5%=48%, p=0.0333 vs vehicle; 1.0%=50%  \n p=0.0205 vs vehicle; vehicle=30%).\n\nConclusion: Compared to vehicle, AZR-MD-001 significantly improved  meibomian gland secretions and tear film stability, which resulted in  clinically significant improvements in ocular symptoms after 6 months of treatment\n\nJones L, Craig J, Hinds M, Alster Y, Bosworth C, Ng A.. **Sign and Symptom Improvement Rates Among MGD Patients Following 6 Months of Treatment With AZR MD 001** American Academy of Optometry, New Orleans, October 12, 2023:\n\nPurpose: AZR MD 001, a topical ophthalmic ointment consisting of  selenium sulfide as an active ingredient (either 0.5% or 1.0%  concentration), was investigated in a Phase 2 clinical trial as a new  treatment for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Treatments for MGD seek  to demonstrate strong efficacy, restore gland function, and improve  patient symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the responder  rates for signs and symptoms in patients with MGD following 6 months of  treatment with AZR MD 001.\n\nMethods: For this multicenter, double-masked, vehicle-controlled,  parallel-group trial (NCT03652051), randomized patients (1:1:1) received  AZR MD 001 (0.5% \\[n=82\\] or 1.0% \\[n=83\\]) or vehicle (n=80) twice weekly  before bed for 6 months. Eligible patients were ≥18 years of age,  exhibited meibomian gland obstruction (Meibomian Gland Secretion \\[MGS\\]  score ≤12 for 15 lower lid glands), and were required to discontinue  topical prescription ocular surface treatments for ≥2 weeks and topical  ophthalmic preparations (including artificial tear substitutes).  Predefined responder criteria, based on literature thresholds, were:  Meibomian Glands Yielding Liquid Secretion (MGYLS) change from baseline  ≥5, MGS score >12, and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score  <13. Analyses included all data through month 6.\n\nResults: AZR MD 001 showed a higher percentage of patients with a  clinically meaningful improvement of ≥5 more glands yielding meibum  compared with vehicle (MGYLS: 60%, p<0.0001 for AZR MD 001 0.5%; 43%,  p=0.0218 for AZR MD 001 1.0%; 22% for vehicle). Significantly more  patients randomized to AZR MD 001 demonstrated normal meibum (MGS  >12) as early as 14 days (20%, p=0.0380 for AZR MD 001 0.5%; 19%,  p=0.0949 for AZR MD 001 1.0%; 7.6% for vehicle). Patients continued to  demonstrate normal meibum at month 6 (74%, p=0.0017 for AZR MD 001 0.5%;  63%, p=0.1273 for AZR MD 001 1.0%; 48% for vehicle). By month 6,  significantly more patients treated with AZR MD 001 were asymptomatic  for disease (OSDI <13: 48%, p=0.0333 for AZR MD 001 0.5%; 50%,  p=0.0205 for AZR MD 001 1.0%; 30% for vehicle).\n\nConclusion: Over 6 months, a statistically significant proportion of  patients applying AZR MD 001 demonstrated a clinically meaningful  response, with normalization of their meibomian gland function and the  achievement of asymptomatic status for disease.\n\nSource: [https://core.uwaterloo.ca/publications/?pub-year=2023](https://core.uwaterloo.ca/publications/?pub-year=2023)",

    "body": "37 m, had seb derm since my mid-late teen years - scalp, sides of nose, beard and more recently eyebrows.  Treated with medicated shampoos and creams in the past - nizerol, selenium sulfide - some hydrocortisone - have been lucky with no topical steroid complications.  It manages it ok for a few weeks when I use these products after a long break.  Brushing hair and beard regularly helped a bit but no particular magic solutions. \n\nIt's been super bad towards end of this year - tired, stress etc. I suspect rolling around training grappling all the time probably doesn't do it much good either.   Lifestyle has been pretty well in check - eating high protein and lots of fruits and vegetables, keeping super fit, sleep is reasonable.   Despite this it was too the point where huge flakes were just spontaneously forming and falling out of my beard and visible on my eyebrows without even scratching.  \n\n  \nBought a bottle of the bulletproof MCT and have been generously applying it each night before bed since beginning of this week - major decrease in symptoms.  Barely visible on my moustache area today where it used to be really bad, no flakes falling off eyebrows.  I've made no other changes so far except maybe getting a bit more sun than usual.  I haven't washed my hair at all this week - I've just rinsed it with water.  I should probably use something soon but a bit nervous of upsetting the good thing I have going.  I'm wondering if I give myself a break from the chemical shampoos I've had on rotation - coal tar & salicylic acid, selenium sulfide and nizerol and just find something gentle/natural? One place I read was having good results with tallow soap but have heard mixed things here! Not quite sure what to try. Maybe a tea tree shampoo or something? ",

I didn't buy anything fancy - just the Solimo brand from Amazon. I started doing nightly oil treatments on my scalp then washing the next morning. I use two shampoos - Trader Joe's Tea Tree shampoo first to get all the oil out, then follow with DermaZen shampoo and leave that on for a few minutes. I rinse and finish with Trader Joe's Tea Tree Conditioner. I dry my hair thoroughly after showering. I've been doing this every day for the past two weeks and my scalp is 90% better. Unfortunately I still have flaking, but the oozing and severe dryness have subsided. I really hope this continues to work!",

    "body": "Ive always had sensitive skin, since I was a baby. I first started showing symptoms when I was 15 (I am now 26), it started with an itchy scalp and mild dandruff. When Head & Shoulders quit working I moved on to T-Gel, then Selsun Blue, then H&S intensive care, then a prescription shampoo (active ingredient Selenium Sulfide). Each shampoo worked wonders...at first (it seriously felt like sticking your head in the freezer on a hot summer day), however they all stopped working after about a month. Then began using combinations of each shampoo, until that stopped working. When I found myself washing my hair with 5 different shampoos each night to simply *maintain* a tolerable level of itchy dandruff, I quit and went cold turkey. After 2 months my conditions returned to their original levels, but still persist to this day. From a scale of 1-10, with 1 being \"my head itches\" and 10 being \"my hair is falling out\" i'm usually in the 4-7 range. My father had the same condition, to some degree, when he was my age but now is clear of symptoms (at 65).\n\nAnyone else with SD that can share stories, advice? Im not looking for a cure, there is none. Im just interested in listening to other people's experience. Thanks!\n\nP.S. I would like to add that this condition is NOT all that bad, compared to say, cancer. If there was a /firstworldproblems for chronic health conditions this would fit. Just inconvenient, occasionally embarrassing, and kind of aggravating (think entire head sized mosquito bite itchiness). \n\n[For those who don't know what it is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seborrhoeic_dermatitis), there is a naturally occuring yeast that lives on the body, especially in the scalp and face regions. Normally the relationship is symbiotic, but occasionally it triggers an auto-immune type reaction from the body leading to inflamed red itchy skin, chronic dandruff, and cracked bleeding skin. Severity can vary.  ",

As far back as I can remember(6th grade in this case: 10 years ago), I have been told by fellow students that I have cradle cap, dandruff, and a few have jumped back in fear upon assuming I have lice.  It's humiliating to try to explain a condition you can barely pronounce and they won't understand.\n\nOver the course of my life, I've tried a cornucopia of products: T-Gel(Tea tree oil), Selsun Blue, Head and Shoulders, not to mention a couple handfuls of shower cap treatments.  The treatments were either too much of a lifestyle change or over time, they lost effectiveness.\n\nI would consider shaving my head, but haircuts used to be an absolute nightmare.  I let my hair grow out long on the top and medium on the sides just to hide the clusters that peeked out all the time.  I was fine with just \"getting by\" at that point...\n\nUntil I went to Supercuts one day.  I had gone there every month or so for at least 2 or 3 years before then.  Every person who worked on my hair was more than cautious.  With a simple comb-through, I could be wincing or even bleeding if the Dermatitis was snagged.  Anyway, one day I walk in and the stylist at the desk asks me if I still have Dermatitis.  I obviously said yes, to which he stated they would no longer be able to give me service.\n\nLuckily, I found a spa in my area that my parents were more than willing to use for me.  The stylists are more experienced, friendly, and aren't shocked by my condition.  After a few years of continued service, I caught wind of this product that was only available for use by salons that would be available to consumers very soon.  That's how I came across Kerastase.\n\nNow, I'm 21 and have a treatment every 6 weeks at the spa and I use Kerastase Shampoo and Conditioner.   Obviously, it hasn't vanished, BUT along with regular blonde highlights(Brown hair obviously accentuates the problem), I haven't had a single comment made to me in the past few years.\n\n**tl;dr kids acted like they were dermatologists and diagnosed me daily.  Most products didn't work, I can't shave my head, Supercuts refused to serve me anymore, but now I have blonde highlights and use Kerastase.**",

I have quite long, thick hair so I give myself a more intensive treatment than is listed on the bottle.  I generously slather the stuff on my dry scalp and then massage with fingertips while in front of the telly for a while - I usually let it sit for about 30 - 60 minutes before showering it out.  I'll do this after a bad flareup and then twice a week thereafter (alternating with other shampoos - selenium, salicylic acid, tar - whatever is around).\n\nI had my hair coloured professionally for the first time this summer - interestingly, after the process my scalp was quite tame for about a month.

I googled and I've seen the same symptom of SD. I went to the doctor and told me it was mostly a stress and gastritis related problem. Then she gave me Nizoral and a cream with cortisone, both worked good enough to control it for about 2 years. I received some advice from friends that told me that cream was not a very good option as it makes your skin thiner.\n\nLast week (back at home) I went to a new dermatologist. She banned me all alcohol, cigarettes, sodas, sun, sweat, dust contact and vitamins B1, B2 and B12 and, together with another medicines (Isotretinoina and Dapsona) and shampoos (coconut based).

I have had scalp SebDerm since I was born (epic cradle cap), started prescription shampoo at 8 yo (selenium sulfide was prescription in 1964).  I am 67 now. Very marginal control my entire life. Recently (maybe two years), it had gotten much worse to include severe face, underarms, groin, ears, etc.\n\nIn May 2023, a derm went all out IMO. The results have been excellent. Very happy.\n\nFACE: Pimecrolimus cream: A topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI). It works by suppressing the immune response that leads to inflammation and skin irritation. Started daily, but now only needed about once a week. Miraculous results for me so far.\n\nSCALP: Rotate all the typical shampoos daily (selenium, zinc, ketokonazole). Been doing that forever. Added Clobetasol Solution as needed, a very powerful corticosteroid. Seems I only need this about twice a month.\n\nEARS/UNDERARMS/GROIN: Triamcinolone Cream, another powerful corticosteroid. I have settled on about twice a week. Working great for me.\n\nOthers: She gave me samples of other meds to try on my face and report back how they worked. Said she would prescribe what I liked best. These are very new and I assume expensive. I haven’t tried these yet.\n\nZoryve: (FDA approved July 2022). Roflumilast Creme, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor. Previously used orally for COPD. How available as a topical creme.\n\nVtama: (FDA approved June 2022). A Tapinarof Creme. Activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) in the skin to reduce inflammation. The way it works is similar to topical coal tar, but without the nasty stuff.",

    "body": "I often see posts regarding keto rash. I don't know if this will help anyone. I have no medical learning. But many years ago I had a rash, I thought it was from the detergent I was using.\n\nMy Doctor said he didn't think so. He thought it was from 1 of three things, yeast or fungi on my skin from the air, or from toxins leaving my body as I was increasing my dry brushing, tea, and water intake. He didn't do any testing as it wasn't bothering me that much. But said if I wanted he could.\n\nWhat he did suggest was to try using Original medicated Selson Blue shampoo as a body wash. He said he had several people who said it was very effective.\n\nI tried it and for me it cleared up the rash along my neck that has been a persistent problem for me. I have used it for a long time.\n\nAgain I have no idea if it will work for others, but it's not overly expensive. When I felt like I was getting the start of a rash from eating low carb, again along my neck, I rubbed the shampoo into my neck line, before I got in the shower, waited a few minutes, then showered. It cleared it up and I have had no problem since.\n\nI hope this might help someone, while I have good health insurance and do not have to pay for a script, I think the shampoo is a healthier choice. Plus I can get it any time I want. It has 1% Selenium sulfide as the active ingredient. I have looked at cheaper store brands that have the same active ingredient, but some of the inactive ingredients were different, so I have only used the Sesun Blue brand. Maybe the cheaper ones would work though? ",

    "body": "Please forgive how messy this is. I'm just rather excited by this revelation.\n\nI just ate some junk food (a big no no, and my face started flamming up like crazy).\n\nUsually when I take MSM for rosacea, it is only preventive. It doesn't get rid of existing inflammation. By accident I took an extra amount of selenium with my MSM and within MINUTES, my rosacea was gone.\n\nI was absolutely baffled by what happened and started digging deeper into selenium.\n\nBefore I get into this, one potential cure for seb derm/ rosacea is selenium sulfide.\n\nSelenium is an important co-factor in glutiathione peroxidase which speeds up the cleanup of free radicals. My belief now is that, if MSM isn't working for you, you may potentially have a selenium deficiency.\n\nSelenium seems to have a LOT of connections to seb derm and rosacea. It protects against UV rays which is a trigger for rosacea.\n\nHIV patients are more often deficient in selenium AND are most often susceptible to seb derm/rosacea. \n\nStudies have shown that people taking selenium have less acne, as it's a powerful antioxidant. \n\nSUGARS and butters have been found to lower selenium levels, and Sugar is a known trigger for rosaceans. (I don't know about you guys but butter also triggers me)\n\nRosacea was known as a the masturbation disease in the victorian era. I know my rosacea flares up when I masturbate. Selenium is a needed element with zinc in the production of sperm. Hyper masturbation may have used up the reserves of selenium.\n\nSelenium sulfide is used as an anti-dandruff formulation. Rosaceans are known to have dandruff more often. While it's applied externally, I believe the issue is internal and producing selenium sulfide in the body is the key to solving this issue.\n\nAll of this said, important caveat. DO NOT take more than 400mg of selenium a day. It is HIGHLY TOXIC and can easily induce death. \n\nIF someone would like to experiment with me, I will be using selenium in 400mg doses combined with 4500mg of MSM together to see if this is a potential cure of rosacea... and it's cause. Since I know MSM has done wonders to my rosacea and for many others, perhaps it's only half of the equation we've been missing, and why some people don't respond to MSM. Perhaps they have plenty of sulfur but lack selenium. \n\n\nThis is all just a hypothesis now and I'm still looking into it. Please share your thoughts or experiences. \n\nEDIT:\nMinor update... I'm going to roll the dice and go for 1000mcg of selenium. If I die, I die. But I've read some chinese studies using as high as 1000mcg with no adverse affects, I don't recommend anyone else try this, But I will be. I will udpate in a week any results. So far nothing negative.\n",

I know people react differently to different products but I've tried this, and it has completely ended my SD after 4 years on CP.\n\nI used to have SD on my face (mainly on the t-zone area), my doctor prescribed CP to use which helped a lot, but would come back as soon as I stopped. So 3 months ago I decided to do some change to switch into a more natural approach.\n\nBased on the research that I did, I understood that in order to kill the fungus, you have to breakdown the biofilm that the fungus creates to protect itself. So what I did was use H&S clinical strength which contains Selenium Sulfide. I put that every morning for 5-10 mins until i felt it burning then I would rinse with cold water.\n\nAfter that, I apply some dead sea salt diluted in water which I spray on my face with a spray bottle and leave it for another 5-10 mins (this will burn but feels good). Then rinse with cold water again.\n\nDoing this not only kills the biofilm, but also kills Malassezia, However leaves your skin very very very dry. So the next step is crucial for keeping your skin baby smooth with no flakes whatsoever.\n\nI apply Cetaphil on my face in the morning and at night before I sleep. And I swear I've never seen my face this smooth before.\n\nI do the H&S +  Dead sea salt every 2-3 days 1 time in the morning\n\nCetaphil everyday ( morning + night)\n\nAvoid hot showers! Cold water  helped me alot :)\n\nAgain, I know this condition is a case to case, but if someone is desperate and is not allergic to any of the ingredients I have mentioned, then try it out for a day or 2 and see how it feels :) ( I got instant results just after 2 times of trying it).",

Here is a quick summary of some of the key insights from the report they released on the 27.11.2024:\n\nThe Phase 2 extension trial of AZR-MD-001, a selenium sulfide ophthalmic ointment, demonstrated its effectiveness in treating meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) over a 6-month period. The study found that both 0.5% and 1.0% concentrations of the ointment significantly improved MGD clinical signs, including meibomian gland secretion and expression, and alleviated dry eye symptoms, as evidenced by reduced Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores. The 0.5% concentration showed particularly strong efficacy, with more participants achieving normal meibum secretion. Safety was generally good, with treatment-emergent adverse events  being mild to moderate and decreasing over time. These findings suggest AZR-MD-001 may be a promising new treatment for MGD, offering improvements in both signs and symptoms, with a favorable safety profile.\n\nKey outcomes that improved included:\n\n1. **Meibomian Gland Yielding Score (MGYLS):** Both the 0.5% and 1.0% AZR-MD-001 groups showed statistically significant increases in the number of glands producing liquid meibum, with the 0.5% group showing a 1.9-point improvement and the 1.0% group a 1.1-point improvement compared to vehicle at 6 months.\n2. **Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI):** The 0.5% AZR-MD-001 group experienced a significant reduction in dry eye symptoms, with a 4.5-point improvement in OSDI scores at 6 months compared to the vehicle group.\n3. **Meibomian Gland Score (MGS):** Significant improvements in meibomian gland secretion quality were observed, with the 0.5% AZR-MD-001 group showing a 4.7-point improvement compared to vehicle at 6 months.\n4. **SPEED (Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness):** Both treatment groups showed reductions in SPEED scores, with the 0.5% group showing a 2.3-point improvement at 6 months, significantly better than the vehicle group.\n\nLink to the publication: [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39613259/)\n\nLet me quickly put this into perspective for those who are not familiar with clinical studies. The requirements are very strict, if medication manage to perform that well without serious side effects, this is a real reason for hope! I hope this makes your day. It for sure made mine.",

But basically keep your carb intake under 30-50g (have to find the carb threshold that works for you).\n\nI believe to truly see the benefits you have to eat this way for 3-4 weeks. Some people see results in less, but the main thing is being consistent. If you go one day keto, one day eat carbs, next day keto.. etc.. You'll never get into ketosis / a ketogenic state which is what I think may have a benefit for the immune system in fighting bad bacteria / fungus.\n\n==\n\n**#2 Fasting** \\- I do 18-20 hour fasts 1-3 times during the week. There is a process that occurs called \"Autophagy\" when being in a fasted state for 18 hours, you can google and see how autophagy can cause degradation of bacterial and even viral infections.\n\nMy simple way of doing it is.. last meal at 8pm, eat your next meal at 2-5pm.\n\n=\n\n**#3** I alternate between these shampoos throughout the week.  \n\\- **Head & Shoulders Classic** (contains Zinc pyrithione: anti fungal and has antibacterial properties)  \n\\- **Nizoral** (contains Ketoconazole 1%)  \n\\- **Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength Advanced Oil Control** (contains Selenium Sulfide)  \n\\- **Truseb** (it's a pet shampoo but contains both Chlorhexidine Gluconate 2%, Ketoconazole 1%)I know it's a pet shampoo, but if you read the reviews on Amazon, lots of people use for their scalp.\n\n==\n\nNote:- When I do #1 it slowly goes away, inflammation is lessened and eventually my scalp becomes 100% clear\n\n\\- When I do #1 and #2 , same as above but seems to clear the folliculitis even faster\n\n\\- When I just do #3 and eat a \"Standard American Diet\" enjoying burgers etc, it reduces folliculitis and after a few weeks use, my scalp will clear 98% but I will still feel the occasional tingling / itching and a bump may appear, but not as bad as it would without the shampoos.\n\n\\- When I do #1 and #2, My threshold seems to be having 2-3 \"Whatever I want\" meals in a week. I usually reserve this for the weekend and my scalp will still remain clear.- Also want to add that I do workout 3-4 times a week\n\n\\- I'm not 100% perfect with all this, sometimes I veer off and will enjoy whatever I want for some weeks, but it seems to always come with the trade-off of getting folliculitis symptoms returning. I'm just happy to have found something I can rely on that I know will clear it.\n\n==\n\nI recently  introduced **Probiotics (Acidophilus)** as I read a study that was done where this probiotic cleared folliculitis in some patients. [https://nahrainuniv.edu.iq/en/node/433](https://nahrainuniv.edu.iq/en/node/433)\n\nI also introduced **PanOxyl Acne Wash (contains Benzoyl Peroxide)** as a shampoo 1-2 days a week to try it out. I've read a lot of members here had good results with it. I have done a couple washes with it so far and I do think it's helpful.\n\nEDIT:- Just wanted to also note that keeping a good bedding hygiene routing is important (clean your pillow cases, replace overly dirty pillows)\n\n\\- I have tried using **PanOxyl Acne Wash** for a couple days on my scalp, but I believe my scalp / head is sensitive to it, as it made my ears red , itchy, and scaly for a few days. This appears to be a typical reaction for some people and is stated on the bottle... BUT the rest of my body seems to react well to it. It actually has cleared some folliculitis / acne I had on my shoulders. So I will keep using it for my body.\n\n\\- I'm 6 days into Keto after a few weeks of going off and not being religious about washing my hair, so I did get some mild folliculitis symptoms that returned, but after doing the above routine for just about 1 week, my scalp is already clearing again and my skin is becoming vibrant.- I think for me personally my body just does not react well when I introduce Wheat, Refined Carbs, Sugar, and anything with Flour or Yeast.",

    "body": "I've received some questions on how to build a shampoo routine as a follow up on this post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how\\_i\\_got\\_severe\\_sebderm\\_and\\_hair\\_loss\\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how_i_got_severe_sebderm_and_hair_loss_under/)), so I thought I'd share my experience. Not intended to be a professional guide or something but just a sharing of my personal experiences in the last several months of successfully controlling sebderm.\n\nNow my scalp is quite healthy: no itch, no soreness, normal shedding, no dandruff, very very mild redness after combatting shampoo for several months.\n\nEverything that I shared here is a result of extensive research looking into scientific evidence. But for convenience's sake, I will leave out the references in this post. I would post detailed references if asked on any specific point in the comment session.\n\n**Recap**\n\nSebderm is both internal and external. The following discussion is limited to external factors only. My routine/theory is based on the three/four-part components proposed earlier: (1) disrupt biofilm, (2) kill the yeast, (3) repair skin barrier, and (4) use gentler surfactants.\n\n**Hair Loss and Products**\n\nSince I also suffered from hair loss and scalp buildup, I prefer silicone-free shampoos and those with a shorter ingredient list.\n\n**Shampooing Frequency**\n\nMore frequent shampooing, even daily shampooing, does not cause hair loss or increased hair shedding. It is the irritation that causes increased hair shedding or hair loss, for example, by using a shampoo that is not suitable for your skin type, or allergy caused by certain ingredients in the shampoo.\n\nAfter trial and error, I found out that shampooing every other day (so about 4 times a week) works the best for me. If you have a dry scalp, you can shampoo less. But shampooing every 3-4 days when one has an oily and itchy scalp for fear of hair loss is not promoting good scalp health.\n\n**How I Built my Routine**\n\nMy current routine: (a) Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo, (b) Sachajuan Scalp Shampoo, (c) Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo, and (d) Ciclopirox Shampoo.\n\nWhen washing my hair, I use a silicone scalp scrubber (available on amazon and is quite affordable) to apply the shampoo evenly to my scalp and to massage my scalp. This serves three purposes: loosen the scales, apply the active ingredient to every inch of the scalp, stimulate blood flow for healthy hair growth.\n\nAfter blow drying my hair, I apply (e) a hydrating scalp spray.\n\n**Rationale for (a) T/Sal Shampoo and Alternatives**\n\nT/Sal contains salicylic acid. It's an ingredient recommended and used by dermatologist in treating sebderm. It serves the following purposes in this routine: reduces sebum production, removes product buildup, loosen the flakes, calms down inflammation, and unclogs pores for healthy hair growth.\n\nIf T/Sal is not available, there are some alternatives: Psoriasin 3% Salicylic Acid Shampoo, Selsun Blue 3% Salicylic Shampoo, and DHS Sal Shampoo.\n\nI think applying liquid salicylic acid to the scalp 10-15 minutes before shampooing and then using a shampoo that doesn't contain the acid would also work. Paula's Choice 2% BHA Exfoliant seems a good choice, though I've never tried it myself. I've conducted research into each ingredient and it would seem that it is safe to be used on the scalp.\n\n**Rationale for (b) Sachajuan Shampoo and Alternatives**\n\n(b) Sachajuan Scalp Shampoo is a shampoo that contains a gentler or second-line antifungal. Another rationale is that it's good to use multiple antifungals in one routine. Alternatives are Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, Happy Cappy 1% Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo, Free and Clear Medicated Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo, Kamedis Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo. I personally don't use zinc pyrithione shampoos because they are often formulated with microplastics, which I avoid because of concern of plastic pollution. But feel free to choose what suits your needs and values.\n\n**Rationale for (c) Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo and Alternatives**\n\nThe Apple Cider Vinegar is for disrupting the biofilm of the yeast that causes sebderm. It also uses gentler surfactants and is silicone-free. This shampoo is also great for maintaining a healthy PH balance of the scalp. Spraying diluted ACV directly on the scalp before shampooing would also help but I just think using this shampoo is more convenient. Some other alternatives are homemade 5% xylitol spray and dermaKB scalp Detoxifier.\n\n**Rationale for (d) Ciclopirox Shampoo and Alternatives**\n\n(d) here is about using a first-line stronger antifungal at least once a week. Alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide shampoos.\n\n**Rationale for (e) Hydrating Scalp Spray and Alternatives**\n\nThe scalp spray serves multiple purposes: repairing skin barrier, calming down inflammation, regulates sebum production, and encouraging skin healing. I'm using a DIY spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water. For more information on making skincare yourself, check out the DIYBeauty subreddit.\n\nWhile I'm using one that I made myself, there are ready-to-use products on the market. I stumbled across this a few days ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how\\_i\\_got\\_severe\\_sebderm\\_and\\_hair\\_loss\\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how_i_got_severe_sebderm_and_hair_loss_under/) (disclaimer: not affiliated).\n\nAloe vera? I tried using aloe vera gel but it causes some white stuff residue on my scalp so I'm sticking with my spray.\n\nWhen choosing toner for use on the scalp, it's best to choose a toner with a minimal ingredient list. The more ingredients, the higher the possibility of irritation to the skin.\n\n**MCT Oil?**\n\nMCT oil worked for me but I'm no longer using it because I don't like how it felt on my scalp. And since I have an oily scalp already prone to sebum buildup, I'm worried that frequent use of MCT oil may clog my scalp further.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions! And I welcome a good, friendly, and productive discussion.",

Thank you so much to the people who posted questions.\n\nBig takeaways were:\n\nSD really has an unknown cause, he said it's so multifactorial and individual.\n\nHe's a big believer in the trio that you all know about: zinc pyrithione, ketoconazole and selenium sulfide. No news there. He likes the idea of rotating those out a bunch.\n\nI asked about digestive/autoimmune and he said it depends on the person, sometimes it can also be an allergy. (Sorry, this isn't helpful..)\n\nBig thing was that he said it really shouldn't be causing hair loss mainly. If you're having hair loss it's due to something else probably and should be evaluated closely. For example, brow hair loss or eyelashes unless you have incredibly severe flaking/itching, should not cause rampant hair loss in those areas.\n\nSorry the update isn't more helpful, thanks again for taking the time to ask questions, I wish I had more specific answers and could have gotten to all of them.\n\nLet me know if you have questions about any of this stuff",

They help but none have been a game changer. But ketoconozol shampoo hasn't really made a difference for my scalp and I've tried all the others (zinc pyrithicone, selenium sulfide etc). \n\nI use a salicylic acid treatment (The Inkey List) and leave that on for an hour or so, then use a clarifying shampoo (just switched to Ouai Detox shampoo). I alternate that with coal tar (Neutrogena T Gel though I've found it's difficult to find outside the US).

I started putting it on before I shower and letting it sit for 30 min or so before I wash it out \n\nOne other thing worth checking might be the type of water you have in your city (hard vs soft). A water filter for your shower head may help a bit.",

I thought Vit D helped, it didn’t help long term (6 months). The advice on my previous post is outdated. \n\nBelow, I’ve written what has been working for me, sorry there’s no TLDR. If you try, please let me know!\n\n\nFor starters, get you some RoyceDerm* cream from Amazon, and follow the directions (2-3x a day for 10 days). *not sponsored at all\n\nThen use a salicylic acid wash to clear the scalp, I use Cerave (you can also use a high pH soap like Dr. Bronners but dilute at least 1:1 ratio minimum, I end up mixing this with Cerave) \n\nThen use a shampoo with zinc pyrithione AND selenium sulfide (use two products if need be, I use a Head&Shoulder shampoo and then conditioner)\n\nLastly, use something that is pH balancing for your scalp. (I use Cerave again, a baby shampoo that’s safe on eyes)\n\nI wash my hair once weekly, in order of what’s listed above. I have Afro kinky hair so this works best for me, it’s also a long wash process so I prefer minimizing water use and time.\n\nI use RoyceDerm once a quarter for upkeep (it’s steroid mimicking so best to not use frequently). \n\nWhile washing, make sure to rub with the pads of your finger tips and not use your nails. Also make sure to leave each product on for a minimum of 5 mins while massaging all over and focusing on problem areas.\n\nStay away from oils placed directly on the scalp in the first few months, shampoo and wash weekly, stop picking as best as you can. Never ever let a stylist put gel or pomades on your scalp for parting.\n\nStay away from heavy products and don’t put absolutely anything on your scalp directly. It may seem counterproductive but the fungus feeds on oil.\n\nI know it’s a lot but it’s what has helped me. Mine was caused by puberty 20 years ago and even with all of this I still deal with dandruff but it went from severe (spread to face, ears, inside nose and hair loss) to manageable with the above routine.\n\nThe only thing I dislike is the lingering sulfur scent in the hair but I’d much rather that than deal with flakes immediately after a wash. Scalp begins flaking about 5-6 days later which is a MAJOR improvement if you ever had severe sebderm.\n\nIt’s now been 9 months and this is the healthiest I have ever seen my scalp.\n\nGood luck! \n\n",

The flax gel is very soothing! Have read it is nourishing to scalp, dunno about that so far; but hair sheds less if I repeat hair mask once week.\nThen I tried adding 200ml liquid Ivermectin (sold as 1% sterile injectable for animals but no one would be stupid enough to inject ivermectin I’d hope, only use topically) to the flax gel, scalp seems to like that; scalp ache is much less. The flax/ivermectin mix is very nice as face/ear/neck mask as well\n\nFor dry patches on face, could try an anti-fungal creams effective against Trichophyton or ringworm if that’s all label shows..",

I started using apple cider vinegar+hibiscrub and washing my hair more often with antidandruff shampoos and the pimples went away, when i started shampooing every 3-4 days they came back so now i know that i need to shampoo more often to keep the pimples away, i dropped the cider vinegar cause apparently it was doing nothing and now i just use ketoconazole\\\\zync pyrithone\\\\selenium sulfide shampoos alongside hibiscrub daily. But i still wanna get rid of these flakes cause i see them every time i’m in natural light, i can’t see them on my body when i look in the mirror but i see them falling when i scratch. After i went to a different gp she said i had seborrheic dermatitis and told me i need to use ketoconazole shampoo then she got mad at me when i told her it’s not working and she said that’s all she can do. What else is there to say, i used finasteride for like 2 months and i stopped like 1 month ago, dunno if that might have caused the problem but i know it can mess your hormones. I think that’s all, again, no itchiness, no red patches(in 1 photo i got this mark on my arm that i think is fading dunno if it’s related and maybe 3-4 pimples on my right hand which seem pretty normal but nowhere else.

    "body": "I’m a 20 year-old woman with somewhat sensitive skin. My skin is clear and supple, but that hasn’t always been the case. I had horrible acne during my sophomore and junior year of high school. My skin cleared up during senior year (2017-2018), but I developed a fungal infection on my face in late 2019 that ruined my complexion. I took steps to cure my fungal acne, and as of March 2020, my skin has been consistently clear! Here’s what worked for me:\n\n1. Treating Malassezia \n\nIn December 2019, tiny itchy bumps began forming on my forehead. I had never struggled with forehead acne before, so this took me by surprise. I applied salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide and made sure to clean my hairline thoroughly everyday, but the bumps persisted and eventually spread to my temples and cheeks. \n\nI began researching my problem and learned that I was most likely suffering from a fungal infection caused by malassezia, a naturally-occurring yeast that can be found on anyone’s skin but can cause problems when it grows out of control. There were many suggested treatments for a malassezia infection, but the most viable treatment seemed to be applying a compound called ketoconazole to the skin. Many people treated their fungal acne with Nizoral, a shampoo that contains 2% ketoconazole. \n\nBut I didn’t try Nizoral first. I tried Selsun Blue, a cheaper shampoo that contains selenium sulfide which some claim kills malassezia. I applied the shampoo to my skin and left it on for ten minutes each night for about a week. I saw no improvement. My skin grew very dry. I developed an area of patchy skin under my chin, which happens when I use skincare products that are too drying. In short, Selsun Blue did not work for me. \n\nDesperate, I decided to spend the extra money and try Nizoral. I applied the shampoo ten minutes each night and saw improvement within the first few days of usage! By the end of the week, my skin was looking significantly better—almost normal! I was left with some mild scarring, but I was just happy that the bumps were gone. The results were miraculous.\n\nAfter two weeks, I stopped applying the product, figuring that I was all good and cured, but the bumps began to return within a couple days. Panicked, I began applying the Nizoral again every night, which solved the problem. But I grew worried that I’d be relying on ketoconazole for the rest of my life! What would happen if Nizoral was discontinued? If I grew tolerant? \n\nI researched ways to cure fungal acne without reemergence. Many people on Reddit and Youtube suggested replacing skincare and makeup products with ones that contain fungal-acne-safe ingredients. I used a website called Sezia to check which products could’ve been exacerbating my condition. Most of my products were problematic, so I developed a new routine with a few inexpensive ones that were supposedly safe.\n\n2. Fungal Acne Skincare/Makeup Routine\n\nI used “cleaner” skincare products in combination with Nizoral to cure my fungal acne: \n\na. I washed my face twice a day with Avalon Organics Intense Defense Cleansing Gel. \n\nb. I applied Nizoral to my problem areas for 5-10 minutes everyday, every other day, or twice a week depending on what I thought my skin needed.\n\nc. I used three drops of pure grapeseed oil as a moisturizer. Many moisturizers feed malassezia, so I played it safe with a light oil.\n\nd. [Morning] I applied Neutrogena’s Ultra Sheer Sunscreen Stick to my skin for SPF protection. \n\nRegarding makeup, I’m going to be totally honest: I had to sacrifice foundation and concealer for clear skin. I actually discovered this accidentally. My skin didn’t completely heal until quarantine began, when I stopped wearing makeup completely. You’re probably wondering, what if that was just a coincidence? I wondered the same thing, but every time I applied foundation or concealer to my skin, I’d get breakouts within a few hours! And I was using products that many deemed safe for fungal acne (Almay Skin-Perfecting Comfort Matte Foundation and ILIA True Skin Serum Concealer). I should note that these breakouts may have not been caused by malassezia and may’ve been an independent reaction to the products (more on that in another post). But in short, I didn’t have clear skin until I stopped using foundation and concealer. \n\n3. Fungal Acne Hair Routine!?\n\nThroughout my battle with fungal acne, I noticed something weird: My scalp grew dirtier, quicker. I normally can go 4-5 days without washing my hair with no problem—people with thick curly hair don’t need to wash our hair as often as those with straight hair—but my scalp would get itchy and oily only 2-3 days after washing. And it developed this weird smell...like...\n\n...yeast. \n\nYup! The malassezia had spread to my scalp—or did it originate there? After researching more about malassezia, I discovered that it can also cause seborrheic dermatitis, a skin condition that I have suffered from on-and-off for years in the top folds of my ears. Perhaps I’d had an overgrowth of malassezia on my scalp for years that hadn’t gotten out of hand until then? Regardless of where the infection originated, I knew that I also had to treat my scalp to avoid continuously spreading the yeast to my forehead. Treat the problem, not the symptoms.\n\nI washed my hair every 3-4 days using Nizoral shampoo. I washed my satin hair scarves and pillowcases frequently to avoid transferring yeast from my hair to my face while I slept. I throughly cleansed my hairline each night with either facial cleanser or Nizoral. Eventually my scalp began to smell normal again and the itchiness subsided. This (along with not wearing foundation and concealer) likely prevented the reemergence of fungal acne after treatment. \n\nConclusion:\n\nIt took about four months to completely cure my fungal acne and heal my scars. This may seem like a long time, but some people struggle with fungal acne for years. Research and experimentation likely extended my battle, but I learned a lot about how to take care of my skin and scalp from the experience. I should note that what worked for me may not work for you! It’s always safest to consult a dermatologist for tips on how to treat your skin issues. Nonetheless I hope this post was helpful!",

Switched to nizoral and it is helping a lot and I have only used it a couple times.\n\nI also started getting bumps on my forehead, I thought it was closed comodones, but it's most likely fungal acne. I started using my nizoral on my face every morning this week, I think it's already making a difference. I didn't think about my shower cap and pillow cases transferring the yeast though. I'll admit I'm horrible about changing those things. It was never drilled into me as a kid, and old habits die really hard as I'm learning in my adult life. Knowing it could take months to totally cure fungal acne makes me feel better though. I get frustrated when things don't work right away lol",

I've tried topical and oral anti fungals, I've tried anti-biotics all either working temporarily or not at all.\n\nBut lately it just disappeared like snow before the sun after making some drastic lifestyle differences and upping my vitamins and minerals. I went to the store and got a magnesium citrate supplement, something I initially bought for tinnitus but after a few days I just stopped shedding skin entirely (coincidence?). Anyway recognizing now that it's something that comes from within, not outside. I started maximizing health parameters so to speak, having a stable circadian rhythm. exercising 3 times a week, taking cold showers, multi vitamins etc and haven't had any skin issues for weeks now.\n\nMy experience: Nothing you can apply on the outside of your skin is going to have any lasting effects on your condition. This condition starts from within, whether you're producing too much sebum or oil or there's a bloodflow issue. Try to figure out the root cause of yours. Oddly enough magnesium did the trick for me and I can't find any sources as to why that happened. Anyway your skin is an organ, topical treatments only scratch the surface of that organ.  \n\n\nEdit: I did start taking probiotics around the same time as the magnesium so could be this and not the magnesium. I use a cheap \"acidophilus\" from pipingrock.",

This has worked for me and just wanted to update on my progress and share again! I haven’t had any flaking on my scalp in around a year and no flaking on my face for around 4 months. ",

    "body": " I'll apologize now because this is going to be a long post.  Even if one person reads it all the way through that is more than the 4 Dermatologists have done since the end of 2019.  This is super hard for me to share, the anonymity is the only thing giving me courage to do so. **I've always had perfect skin, occasional hormonal pimple here and there but I was truly blessed until almost 5 yrs ago.**  No hyperpigmentation, scarring etc.\nI don't think I've spent more than 10-20 mins with a dermatologist and frankly I'm exhausted from finding a doctor waiting 4-8 weeks for an appointment only to be dismissed. I've have been \"secretly\" drug tested (she must have thought I was a complete idiot), told to stop picking-I am not a picker, never have been, told it was related to mental health issues-seek psych doctor (if she had read my history she would've read I already do & talked w/ my doctor about it) I don't know what caused the initial issue but you now have secondary staph infection.  I was dx w/ Sarcoidosis in 2009. Spent many months taking high dose of prednisone until I just could handle it anymore. Then I was weaned off and switched to Methotrexate. I didn't have any skin issues w/ the Sarcoid in 2009-2010 but I know it can cause a myriad of symptoms so I asked dermatologist #2 about it. She emphatically said no. \n\nI've attached pics w/dates. \n\n Here is a list of past prescribed medications I can remember: \n**Bactrim 2x\n**Clindamyxin lotion\n**Mupirocin ointment\n**Nystatin \n**Betamethasone dipropionate ointment\n**Clobetasol propionate cream\n**Compound lotion (nystatin, hydrocortisone and Mupirocin) \n\nBack Story: \n**July 2019**- Spent 10 days in Myrtle Beach for a softball World Series. We spent anywhere from 10-14 hours a day out in the heat. Every night and in the morning when we didn't have to be at the ball field at the crack of dawn. (I always wear sunscreen 30-50spf). Despite trying to stay as clean as possible, I developed a yeast infection under my breasts. Treated it with OTC Monistat. When it cleared I was left with these barely raised brown spots under my breasts.  Now I have those brown spots between my thighs, on my forearms, legs & chest. They become much more visible when I self tan.  When I asked about them, they said it was no big deal probably caused my friction.  \n\n**Nov-2019**-When these \"breakout, flair-ups, issues\" started (honestly I don't even know what to call them).  At first it was one here and there on my cheek. Started as a small itchy bump. Then the skin would thin, peel after showering or washing my face and became a serious hot mess-weeping, itching, painful, and spreading (at one point I had them on my arms, some on my legs, back, chest & stomach).  They seemed to kind of heal but came back &  multiplied.  They would heal on the surface but not underneath and with a raised boarder.  This has been going on for several years.  Fall of 2023 I started having problems with my eyelashes. Ugh! The eyelid/lashline had this build up, scaling & flaking. My freaking eyelashes started falling out.  Eye doctor said she saw some Demodex but because I had already been using scrub wipes it didn't look terrible. Took about 6 months for that to clear. Only for it to start in my eyebrows and scalp. \n\nOTC treatments,I am currently using: \n\n**Malezia-5% Urea Lotion, treatment gel, cleansing balm and MCT cleaning oil (these products have helped immensly)\n**Nizoral Shampoo\n**Butenafine Cream (currently using started this yesterday)\n\nOTC products used in the past that have seemed to help some but never completely cleared it. Note: when I tried the OTC anti-fungal creams I didn't know they needed to be used for several weeks\n\n**clotrimazole cream (helped more than  miconazole\n**miconazole cream\n**Selenium Sulfide Shampoo worked until it didn't (I didn't know you should rotate)\n\n\nOver the years I have noticed several things: \n1) Always reoccurring in a previous location\n2)There is a cycle-flaring up every 6-8 weeks \n3)Being outside in the summer makes it worse. This is one of the hardest things because I love summer. \n4)When it starts to flair up it gets extremely itchy and there is a plethora these hair like structures all over my face. They're short, white in color and very coarse-different from typical vellus hairs. As it runs its course most of these \"hairs\" decrease. \n\nLastly, I've had blood work completed a couple times.  There were a few things that were off but because they were low-normal or high-normal no one seemed to be concerned. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you. Thank you for your time and any help/advice you may be able to provide. ♥️ ",

    "body": "Before you comment anything, please read what I want to say.\n\nI’ve been having problems with my sebderm for around 2 years and never actually had it under control. I tried literally every possible shampoo, oil, method to get rid of it but unfortunately nothing worked. However, I could somehow keep it “normal” with vichy dercos shampoo. Two weeks ago, I was at my friends house and after some talking we ended up on the sebderm topic. She had some problems with dandruff too, but it was mild and it wasn’t sebderm. However, she gave me her shampoo and said that it helped her so maybe it can help me too. I was sceptical about that and didn’t want to try it, because I didn’t want to make things even worse. But I took and and tried it the same day. The shampoo is called Kerastase Symbiose. \nGUYS, I think I finally found something that works for me after two years! After only one wash, my sebderm was much noticeably and there was almost no dandruff. I never wanted to try these kind of stuff, because it didn’t look medical. The shampoo smells weird, but at least it does work. I use it two times a week and you wouldn’t believe what results it made. The best thing is that it isn’t that harsh like shampoos that contain selenium sulfide or zinc. \n\nI also want to say that my sebderm wasn’t at its worst, so if you don’t have any significant problems, give this a try! The only downside is that it’s super pricey and doesn’t have a pleasant smell. I am from Europe, and here we also have conditioners and exfoliants from the same line, so if someone tried these, I would really like to hear if it’s worth buying.",

Bonus points if they are also salt-free, as I have a keratin chemical straightening treatment done, and both those things eat away the treatment.

I've ordered it anyway because my scalp it's behaving extra itchy.\n\nI'm also looking into the following:\n\n\\- D'Aveia DS and anti-dandruff shampoo. It's a Portuguese brand and I can't find the INCI or if they have SLS.\n\n\\- Topicrem DS+ Shampoo and DS+ Baby Shampoo. I think they have SLS, but I'm not sure as I can't find the INCI. KA Keracur Plus Lotion looks amazing, though.\n\nAlso, Zinc Pyrithione has been forbidden in cosmetics shampoos in the EU since March 2022. I can still find shampoos that have it, but I'm avoiding them, as Piroctone Olamine it's a good alternative.\n\nIf anyone has good recommendations about hair products (shampoos, lotions, scrubs...) that aren't Oribe Serene (I wish!), I'd be very thankful.",

Your skin will produce more sebum and that will feed the fungi. Use mct c8 oil or anything that can destroy the biofilm before using the antifungal treatments.

I was on ketoconazole 2% (topical) for 8 years to manage fungal acne, but during that time, I developed unexplained liver issues. It took me a while to connect the dots, but once I realized ketoconazole was the likely culprit, I stopped using it—and my liver health improved significantly.\n\nThe problem? My fungal acne started coming back, and I had to find an alternative. Unfortunately, I’m pretty reactive to coconut oil and selenium sulfide, so my options were limited.\n\nWhat ended up working for me:\nPanOxyl 4% Benzoyl Peroxide Foam – I leave it on for 15 minutes in the morning before rinsing off.\nVanicream Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo – I lather and leave it on for 2-3 minutes in the shower.\n\nIt’s only been about two weeks, but my face is looking even better than when I was using ketoconazole!\n\nJust a reminder to be cautious with prescribed antifungals—even the topical ones. If you’re experiencing unexplained health issues, it might be worth looking into. Hope this helps someone out there!\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience?\n\n",

Plus I might have made an GIGANTIC idiotic mistake so please guide!\n\nMy current routine given by my dermatologist is supposed to be Isotretinoin B.P (0.5mg) every night and soap with Salicylic Acid. I've been following it on and off for the last 7 to 8 years. I say supposed to be because I don't apply Isotretinoin every night. \n\nI also just realized that the soap that I've been using every chance I get (usually before sleeping, upon waking up, and a few times during the day) is not Salicylic Acid but actually Selenium Sulfide.  The switch up probably happened two to three years ago because both bars of soap have extremely similar names and design and I never bothered to check it properly.\n\nI'll immediately switch to Salicylic Acid soap now, but wanted to confirm a few things.\n\n1. Is the frequency with which I apply the soap too much? Like if I switch to Saciliyc Acid (today probably), should I be using it once a day, twice a day, etc?\n2. I have oily skin and the dermatologist told me to keep it oil-free so if the answer to Q1 is just once, then how do I wash the skin if it becomes oily again? Some gentle facewash/soap?\n3. Should I be taking any vitamins etc that help skin recover? If so, which ones are necessary in what quantity?\n4. Is it likely that the blackheads on my nose + the acne scars not disappearing for months was because of the selinieum sulfide? If I switch to Salicylic Acid, would it become better?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance!  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

And if you wash twice a day use the salicylic acid at a separate time as the tret if you really feel like you need it. Thats too many actives at once.\n\n2. Your skin is oily because you're over washing and not using a moisturizer. Your skin is trying to make up for the natural oils lost and its overcompensating. Stop washing so much and use a moisturizer and a gentle cleanser.\n\n3. Not necessarily. Just eat well. Eat probiotic forward foods, like fermented foods. That helps me a lot.\n\n4. The scars arent going away because you're not wearing sunscreen\n\nStart really paying attention to your skin and be gentle. I personally wash my face once a day and use a gentle cleanser, tret, and double moisturize with a moisturizer and castor oil around my eyes at night. In the morning i splash my face with water and then occasionally put on vit serum and then always sunscreen. know it takes at least a month to really see a difference so don't switch out too many products at once because then you cant tell what works for you and what doesnt.",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI've had success with a method i've developed through a bit of trial and error. The ingredients are relatively cheap and the process isnt painful or that difficult. \n\nI had a very bad flare up for nearly 6 months, after starting this method i've been relatively sebderm free for around the same amount of time. It has reoccurred, but only when I didnt keep up with it.\n\nMy aims were to balance the microbiome on my scalp instead of annihilating it with ketoconazole or selenium sulfide. Both as you know stop doing much after a period of time. They dry out your scalp, dried out you hair, and don't solve much long term\n\nWith this method I have been able to reduce all inflammation on my scalp, prevent the overgrowth of Malassezia, remove flakes, and make my hair look nice and healthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The ingredients I have been using are:**\n\n* Dead sea salt/sea salt\n* MCT oil\n* Rosemary oil\n* Tea tree oil\n* Spray bottle\n* Warm water\n* Exfoliating brush\n* Hair assist shampoo\n* Hair assist conditioner\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The method consists of:**\n\n1. Add 250mL of warm water to a container (my spray bottle is 250mL)\n2. Add 1.5 Tablespoons of dead sea salt, 10 drops of MCT oil, 6 drops of Rosemary oil, 2-3 drops of tea tree oil\n3. Shake until homogenous and pour into spray bottle\n4. Go outside or into the shower and spray directly onto scalp in between your hair \n5. Apply to all areas necessary, scalp, facial hair, eyebrows, skin. Continue to shake the bottle to keep the mixture homogenous.\n6. Leave on surface for 20-30 minutes or longer\n7. Use exfoliating brush in the shower and gently exfoliate scalp.\n8. Balance hair oil levels with Sebderm friendly shampoo as necessary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I use this method roughly 3-4 times a week when I have visible flakes, and 2-3 times a week during remission.* \n\n*Tea tree oil is quite strong, do not over do it, only use tea tree oil during flare ups or when you have visible Sebderm.*\n\n*Your scalp will be different to mine, it may be more or less oily, you will have more or less hair etc etc. Adjust the quantities to what suits you.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My reasoning behind this method:**\n\n* Dead sea salt is a great base for microbiome balancing, it is full of minerals that are beneficial for scalp and hair health. \n* MCT oil will provide a neutral oil to hydrate your skin and hair and will help carry the other oils. It does not feed Malassezia, neither do any of the other oils (to my knowledge).\n* Rosemary oil has centuries of use for hair growth and health, studies have compared its efficacy to minoxidil, it is also antimicrobial.\n* Tea tree oil is a very strong antiseptic, it is to be used sparingly and only when necessary. If you ever get it in an open wound or cracked skin this will become apparent.\n* Hair assist shampoo and conditioner are Sebderm safe, I am unsure if these are available outside of Australia, but other Sebderm safe shampoos and conditioners exist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith these ingredients combined, and gentle exfoliation, my scalp is no longer ever itchy, my Sebderm is at bay and my hair doesn't look like its been in an airfrier. The ingredients also smell far better than Selsun gold. I love this method because it feels safe, natural and healthy. There is no mystery behind the ingredients and they seem to work pretty well. \n\nThis is not a cure, you need to keep up with application. If you go a week without application the Malassezia population will increase again. But if you keep on top of it, your scalp wont itch, there wont be flakes and your hair will look better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where to buy:**\n\n* Dead sea salt - Can be found **online**, it is cheap and will last a very long time. You can use sea salt but it must not contain anti-caking agent, as store bought table salt does. A 1kg bag of Dead sea salt lasts me up to **4-6 months and costs $20**.\n* MCT oil - Is available **online** and at **chemists**. A 500mL bottle costs **\\~$25 and will last you several years**. \n* Rosemary oil - Is available online and at some chemists. It is the most costly ingredient but is worth it. A bottle may cost **$25 and will last a roughly 1-2 months**.\n* Tea tree oil - Is also available online and at chemists. It is roughly the same price and will last you much longer.\n* Hair assist shampoo and conditioner - Available online and at some chemists: [https://www.mychemist.com.au/shop-online/1151/hair-assist](https://www.mychemist.com.au/shop-online/1151/hair-assist)\n* Nubrush -  For exfoliation: [https://www.salonshoponline.com.au/products/nu-brush](https://www.salonshoponline.com.au/products/nu-brush)\n* Any spray bottle will work\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's pretty much it, if anybody has any suggestions please let me know, and if you have any questions I will try and answer them.\n\n&#x200B;",

It solved my itchy scalp, was cheap to maintain, and saved me a few bucks a month. I will say I was not \"doing\" my hair at the time, no products or gels or curling. Not sure how bronners would work with that level of maintenance. I also sometimes soaked my head/hair while taking an Epsom salt bath, which also helped the itching.

    "body": "I have tried AIP diet, cutting out certain foods (eggs, dairy, etc), medicated shampoos (still using 2% keto, selenium sulfide, T-sal, etc), oral anti-fungals, topical corticosteroids ... NOTHING has worked except: sleeping and also not touching my hair and not applying traction (hairstyles and excessive combing) when I'm awake. My scalp feels amazing every morning when I wake up, but progressively worsens throughout the day. I have long hair and when I can leave it down and not touch it AT ALL (like minimal movement of hair), it is the most calm. But it's very difficult. Shorter hairstyles have not helped that much before. And I can't go too short bc my hair is too thin right now. \n\nAnyone else find this? I realize that if this is my main trigger of inflammation, then shaving my head is he best solution, but I'm a woman with long hair and that would be a difficult change. Anyone else have this and found a different solution/have any suggestions that have helped you without shaving your head? \n\nThanks 🙏🏼",

    "body": "I wanted to share something, because I finally found my \"holy grail\" solution but first some backstory you can skip, I'll do a paragraph break for the tip.\n\nSo I've had sebhorreic dermatitis on my scalp since I was a child. I'm in my thirties now and I've been trying things forever to try and stop it, it flares up worse sometimes and now I'm going grey it's really noticible. So, list of things I've tried include: Tea tree, ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid, oiling my scalp, avoiding sodium lauryl sulfate in shampoos, and a lot more I'm probably forgetting.\n\nWhat I finally found that works *for me* and might help others is washing my hair with a sillock base emollient ointment (you can find no name brand tubs of this at your pharmacy), make sure it says on the container that it can be used as a soap substitute.\n\nWhen washing your hair, in the shampoo step, spread it on your fingertips (works best to be precise) carefully get it onto your scalp, cover your scalp in it, then massage it in then let it sit for 3-5 mins, then wash out. Then, continue with routine as normal. \n\nI also found that spot treating any scales that are on your scalp with hyaluronic acid can help, too.\n\nI think that a lot of actives for this problem can be very, very drying, and I was just so fed up I went the other way and tried hydrating, and it worked. My scalp has been clear for about a year now. \n\nTl;dr: sillock base emollient ointment as shampoo, spot treat with hyaluronic acid.",

It checks a lot more positive boxes than any other shampoo I've used before. Normally I find that other shampoos help 1 symptom but not others. It's nice that this one has given me an \"overall\" improvement if that makes sense.\n\nIt has ketoconazole in it, but really the other ingredients and formulation are what make it stand out.\n\nIt's sulfate-free (doesn't have the ingredient in normal shampoos that completely strips the oils and nutrients from your hair) so it allows the moisture to remain on your scalp and doesn't damage your hair.\n\nIt has healthy oils specifically chosen to provide relief, and my scalp really has been so soothed by it. My incessant itching and the pain on my scalp has decreased a lot. My scalp still itches but it doesn't feel like it's on literal fire like it did before. Just feels like normal mild itching now.\n\nIt also combats the hair loss caused by sebderm, because it has saw palmetto (blocks DHT, the hormone which causes hair loss), caffeine (improves blood flow to the follicles), a menthol derivative (also increases blood flow), niacin, vitamins B3 and B6.\n\nI've had a lot of significant hair loss from my sebderm but now I have a bunch of brand new short little hairs coming in all over so I feel like the shampoo is helping for that.\n\nThe menthol stuff in it feels really good too. I leave the shampoo on my scalp for about 5-10 minutes and the whole time it gives this super cold cooling feeling that feels like sweet relief if your scalp is irritated.\n\nThat's all I can remember about the formulation right now but there's a few other moisturizing and enriching ingredients too. Honestly feels like someone who actually has sebderm must have worked on the formulation of this product because it's so detailed.\n\nI order mine on Amazon. The Regenepure brand also has a whole line of other products intended to be used in conjunction with the DR shampoo but the ingredients in those didn't really interest me like the shampoo does. Worth taking a look at though maybe since you're looking for other stuff to use beyond just shampoo.",

But I’d say Magnesium did the most part.\n\n\\- Never had Acne or severe acne when I was a teenager.\n\n\\- Took lot of antibiotics because I was always sick of Sore throat.\n\n\\- Was not diagnosed but at risk of having fatty liver when I was 19.\n\n\\- Developed Dandruff when I was 21.\n\n\\- Combination skin (face) when I was 22 and had Redness and Dry spots on my face, specially on winters.\n\n\\- Started with creams because of reason above, until I developed Malassezia Folliculitis.\n\n\\- Since then, I still have Malassezia Folliculitis on my face, back, shoulders, and chest sometimes (not much really, but not cleared 100%, Id say I cleared 98%).\n\n\\*\\* 5 years doing full research and now under control\n\n\\*\\* “fix”(under control) by improving diet AND using Selsun Blue shampoo (selenium sulfide) as facial mask.\n\n\\*\\* Quit shampoo (I only use it maybe once in 2-3 months when I have a “fungal acne flare up”\n\n\\*\\* I feel Carbs (vegetables, parboiled rice, sourdough or buckwheat bread/pasta) work better for me than Fat foods (I think it might be due to my Nervous System - Ectomorph body type).\n\n\\*\\* Used [Ritual.com](https://Ritual.com) brand Multivitamin for 6 months and worked very very well: energy improved, almost no flare-ups\n\n\\*\\* Quit multivitamin since it had low magnesium, don’t want to supplement on vitamin D every day.\n\n\\- Had dyshidrotic eczema 3 times 3 years ago\n\n\\- Had a big stye in one of my eyes and the day before scheduled surgery I went away (was taking vitamin A (retinol) pills to avoid that and worked?)\n\n\\- Red face\n\n\\- Never got into prick tested to check up on allergies/intolerances.\n\n\\- Used Probiotics for 3 months to restore my gut flora after many years of antibiotics usage.\n\n\\- Never had constipation or similar problems. So I think my skin problems come from the Liver rather than my Gut?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent:\n\n\\- Redness rashes: usually on my face (once a week)\n\n\\- Fungal acne flareups (1 in 2-3 months)\n\n\\- Foruncle (usually once a year): now armpit but I had it in the back of my head, butt, behind ear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings to add:\n\n\\- I don’t move my body as much as I should do. I use to do some push ups (once a week), stretching, and walking outside\n\n\\- I am not extreme with my diet and sometimes eat shtty foods AND drink alcohol once a week (more on vacation).\n\n\\- I try not to eat high PUFA content foods like nuts.\n\n\\- I am a Flight Attendant. I think that raises my cortisol levels, stress, dehydration, cosmic ionizing radiation.\n\n\\- Not concerned on Zinc, DHA, Selenium since I eat a lot of seafood and salmon. 1-3 times a week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThinking of:\n\n\\- Eating more seaweed foods (high in iodine content) and other trace minerals\n\n\\- Ditching fluoride-water and anything linked to fluoride. Drinking Spring Water only.\n\n\\- Quit any Vitamin D supplements unless deficient and trying to get most of it from the Sun to get beneficial UV light to optimize my hormone synthesis and antioxidant melatonin levels, and help reset my circadian rhythms.\n\n\\- Getting veggies, meat, A2 dairy, etc. from local small farms to ensure micronutrient density.\n\n\\- Eating kelp or seaweed regularly, it gives you an amazing spectrum of trace minerals and Iodine\n\n\\- Quitting Coffee and drink Green Tea or Matcha only. Not only there are several studies that indicate it improves eczema and malassezia folliculitis, but wears off free radicals produced by ionizing radiation (and I fly very often…). However, I am concerned about Tea because it contains DAO Blockers and it inhibits the release of histamine in your body (bad for eczema - and seborrheic dermatitis is a kind of eczema).\n\n\\- Taking Diseccated Grass-Fed Beef Liver supplements since I don’t like eating this particular food and I need a strong vitamin A food source.\n\n\\- Taking Vitamin E, full-spectrum (mixed tocopherols) pills or buy Red Palm Oil from Nutiva brand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would you suggest me to do? Any response will be highly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks,",

The ketoconazole worked for a very long time until this time last year when I was planning a wedding and stopped taking fluoxetine and all of a sudden had a massive flare up of scalp issues. I was prescribed Selenium Sulfide 2.25% shampoo which feels barely effective. The days of like using the ketoconazole every once in a while and being symptom free seem to be gone and I hate it.\n\nI am just wondering what else to start trying because I had like, 4 years of wonder and I cannot go back to this. I also deal with eczema and roseacea if that helps.",

    "body": "TL;DR: initial improvement, followed by plateau. Trying to add other routines. Still trying to find a more effective solution. \n\nI posted a while back about starting the raw honey routine. For the first two weeks I shaved my hair with clippers every two days and combined raw honey treatment with rotating medicated shampoos (coal tar, selenium sulfide, salicylic acid, and pyrithione zinc. \n\nThe scaling reduced rapidly over the first 3-4 days, then the redness reduced to a more pinkish color. Around the two week mark I hit a plateau. It was certainly better than it was but didn’t appear to be continuing to improve. \n\nI read advice to try using honey only to cleanse my face and head and discontinued use of the shampoos for two weeks. I also showered the first week every two days and the second week every day. This seemed to make it worse, causing plaque to start building up again, faster than I could exfoliate it. Especially during the every-two-days period. So I resumed using shampoos. \n\nDuring all this time I’ve been doing tons of research, and I found anecdotes about shaving to the scalp with a razor being effective. I also read about using salt water to help heal lesions, and eating raw garlic, apple cider vinegar, and raw honey every day to promote internal healing. Also read a few studies that showed OTC antifungals with butenafine as the active ingredient shows superior results do all other antifungals in treating seb derm. \n\n[Here’s where I am today.](https://imgur.com/a/nhuQ7)\n\nAnd here’s what I’ve been doing the last week. Shaving with a razor each morning. Follow up shaving with apple cider vinegar solution. Let this dry and then apply honey treatment. Take a shower, and wash with one of the products mentioned above. Spend 5 minutes scrubbing flakes off with fingers. Soak a cloth in salt water and hold it on my spots for around 30 seconds each. Rinse head. Every few days use ketoconazole based shampoo. Finish with applying butenafine-based antifungal, and reapplying at bedtime. I’m not sure this regimen is causing any further improvement, but I like to give each test a two week period so I plan to continue with this plan. \n\nReflections on things I’ve tried:\nHoney: initial strong reduction in scaling, itchiness. Plateaued after about two weeks, no further improvement. \n\nApple cider vinegar: I soak a cloth and spread this kn my head at least once a day, more recently immediately after shaving as an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal. I have a theory that shaving may be causing issues because I’m not very good at it still and nick myself most days and also because it gets more direct contact with all areas of my scalp, though it doesn’t seem to be spreading. Topical apple cider vinegar is really helpful if I’m having uncontrollable itching. I’ve noticed stinging has significantly reduced, which to me is a sign that lesions are less “open” than they were. \n\nSalt water: first few days stung really bad (as I was warned) and had to quickly rinse the residue off my skin. By day 3, stinging was gone. I see this as a sign that it is helping minimize having open lesions, and imagine it’s helping with healing and nicks I’m causing myself from shaving. It’s actually quite soothing now to use. \n\nMedicated shampoos: definitely helps exfoliate so I can treat yeast underneath\n\nScalp brush: I purchased a two-sided boar hair bristle brush. Initially I would use it to scrub in shampoo in the shower. That seemed to help reduce the thickness of scaling in my more problematic areas quickly, then didn’t seem to do much once the scaling was reduced and stayed that way. I use it now in two ways. If my scalp is really itchy, it’s a great scratcher. That wayI don’t use my nails and risk breaking open scans/lesions like I used to do a lot. I keep it by my bed at nighttime. If I feel a lot of buildup on my lesions, or they are particularly flaky, I use the brush to help loosen these pieces. I often use the brush before doing my daily regimen because it seems logical to me that exfoliating skin overgrowth helps medication delivery to the yeast underneath. \n\nTherapy: I’ve increased the attention and commitment I’ve given to therapy for treatment if my depression and anxiety. This started around the new year, a month or so before I started the honey treatment. In general, I am happier, calmer, more content, and less stressed. I’m making a lot of progress in this area. It’s also helped me with the ways specifically that my skin issues contribute to depression and anxiety, self-shame, and the importance of acceptance. \n\nSunlight/exercise: I have read sunlight and sweat can be helpful. I walk 20ish minutes  per day, after doing my regimen to give the sunlight the best penetration in terms of its potential effect. This has helped my depression a lot, and I’ve noticed several times that there seems to be quite a big reduction in inflammation for the remainder of the day. Doesn’t seem to be staying though. \n\nDiet: I have been eating better. I am eating few refined carbs these days. I eat fruit and veggies every day and high quality protein, typically organic meats or beans/lentils. Very little in terms of sugary snacks, desserts, or beverages. Minimal dairy consumption (like.. maybe once per week). Minimal consumption of simple carbs like  bread and pretzels (some of my favorite snacks), and eating  brown over white rice. \n\nDrinking/weed: used to use these too much to self-medicate, and they likely weren’t helping my condition. Have gone from drinking 2-3 beers and smoking 1-2 times per day down to doing each 1-2 times per week. \n\nSupplements: daily cocktail of 1 clove garlic, splash of ACV, and squirt of honey diluted in warm water. Daily supplementation of fish oil, turmeric, multivitamin, b12, and probiotics. \n\nStress reduction: daily meditation, affirmations, visualization of being free of seb derm. \n\nTopical steroids: used daily for two weeks without improvement. \n\nNext steps: I remain optimistic though it seems like I’ve hit some barriers in continued healing. I will continue with the raw honey and combining it with alternate treatments in two week periods to try to find the next level of success. A few things I’ve heard can be helpful, and I’m looking at exploring:\n-cutting out drinking/weed completely\n-more vigorous exercise (more sweat->more relief?)\n-food sensitivity testing/elimination diet\n-rotating topical anti fungals\n-BioM8\n-topical turmeric and/or probiotics\n-shower hard water filter\n-UV might therapy\n\n[original post](https://redd.it/7w93zx)\n\n[pics from week 0](https://imgur.com/a/vYLo7) \n\n[post one week 1](https://redd.it/7xtz7v)\n\n[pics from week 1](https://imgur.com/a/dXD9j) ",

I decided to start adding xylitol to the mask, and once I starting doing that, I started healing quickly and became symptom free about two weeks later. Your symptoms look to be a lot more severe than mine were, so I'd give it an honest go for a month before deciding to give up on it.\n\nI would add about a half teaspoon of xylitol to a 1/4 cup of warm distilled water and then stir until it was as dissolved as it was going to get. I then added that water to the honey instead of regular water \n\nNot sure if you're aware, but the reason seb derm is so hard to treat is because the yeast creates biofilms over the colonies to protect itself. Thirs prevents medication from penetrating the problem areas. Two things that are proven to break down yeast biofilms are xylitol and aloe vera. Look up \"Tom Busby biofilm\" for more elaboration on that, this dude knows his stuff about seb derm. \n\nI also used Benton aloe propolis gel, applying it in clean skin about 10 min before applying the mask just to make sure I was hitting the yeast with everything l had. This stuff is really great at soothing itching and inflammation as well. \n\nI would stop using medicated shampoos and other treatments while you try this. A lot of those are extremely irritating with a lot of sulfates and will make the problem worse or at the very least, prevent healing. \n\nGood luck!

    "body": "Hi guys, I’m guessing if you’re on here then like me you suffer from seb derm. It’s such an awful disease - I really do feel for anyone suffering with it. I’m a 33 year old male living in the UK. Randomly started to develop SD when I was about 28 - suffer mainly on my forehead but also have some SD in my hairline, on my eyelids & at the sides of my nose. \n\nLong story short - I went to the doctors numerous times, saw a dermatologist, watched all the YouTube videos, read every article possible to try to help me understand what makes this disease tick (which helps) - I felt I tried absolutely every cream & shampoo you’ve heard of, I just couldn’t seem to get it under control unless using an unhealthy amount of steroid cream on my face, which as we know isn’t good. At times it was so bad it me cry.\n\nHowever, over the last year or so I would say I’ve gotten this disease about 90% under control with a routine I do practically everyday which I’m going to share with you now. Some of the creams/shampoos I use that work now for some reason didn’t seem to work in the past - I put it down to consistency & using them in the correct order. \n\nFirstly from the Supermarket you can get in a bottle raw Apple Cider Vinegar mixed with honey. As you probably know ACV is anti-fungal & anti bacterial, and, most importantly in my opinion (I will tell you why shortly), excellent for exfoliating the skin. Honey is also anti-fungal & anti bacterial. In a morning before I have a shower, I simply pour a bit in my hands (neat) and gently rub it directly on my face & try to leave it on for about 10 minutes. I brush my teeth & do abit of tidying whilst it’s on ha. I’ve been using it for a while so my skin is used to it but if you haven’t used it before then you will definitely need to dilute it with some water otherwise you’ll burn your face off.\n\nI then get it the shower & rinse off the ACV/honey off with COLD water. I’ve learnt/realised over the years that hot water is an absolute no go. Apparently hot water makes your skin produce more oil which we absolutely do not want or need. \n\nI then use a combination of 2 shampoos AT THE SAME TIME. \n\nI use Bioderma Node P, which contains salylictic acid (good exfoliator), 2 antifungal ingredients & Xylitol, which is apparently good at stopping fungus creating a “biofilm” (if you’re not sure what a biofilm is then Google it). \n\nThe other shampoo I use is 2% ketaconazole which is only available on prescription. In my case Nizorel 1% wasn’t strong enough. If you have used Nizorel or the 2% version & it seemed to make it worse then I implore you not to ditch it. What took me a while to find out is that our skin takes time to adjust to different products. It definitely made my SD worse at 1st and I ditched it numerous times over the years before deciding to stick it out. \n\nEarlier I said why I thought it was most important that ACV is a good exfoliator. It’s important to use ACV 1st as this 1st exfoliates the skin & allows the 2% ketaconazole (along with the the other anti-fungals) to penetrate deeper into the skin. Since using the ACV/honey mix 1st before shampooing I’ve noticed a huge difference. I don’t think using ketaconazole alone would have worked.\n\nEvery 3rd or 4th day I do the exact same routine but swap the 2% Ketaconazole for Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength (Selenium Sulfide). Not sure how important this is but alot of articles I’ve read say you should rotate shampoos to stop fungus building a resistance to it so I just do this occasionally to mix things up. \n\nI then wash it off, again with cold water. It doesn’t have to be freezing, just “cold”. Just to add - I still have a warm shower, I just don’t stick my head under the water! \n\nI then dry my face & hair with a towel (gently) and moisturise with Cerave Smoothing Cream, paying special attention to the areas most affected by SD. This cream has been an absolute God-Send. I was extremely sceptical about using a moisturiser at 1st as every single moisturiser I had tried in the past just made my skin worse. But this is different stuff. If I don’t use this cream as part of my routine I still get flare ups.\n\nAnd that is basically it. I do this nearly every morning before work & my SD is practically non existent. Some days if I’m in a rush in a morning I’ll just give my face a quick splash with the ACV/honey, wash off & moisturise, seems to do the trick as a one off (I haven’t trialled doing only this long term). Occasionally in the evening as well I try to give my face a quick rinse with the ACV/honey before bed, or if I’ve got a free night sit with it on my face for an hour or so. If I ever start to feel an itch anywhere I try to dab some of the ACV/honey on it straightaway. All about maintenance. \n\nTo sum up, my general advice to anyone struggling with this condition - if you feel like you’ve tried all the shampoos & they haven’t worked - would be to use ACV or something with salylictic acid in it 1st before using an anti-fungal so it can penetrate deeper. And definitely use that Cerave moisturiser afterwards! \n\nAny questions please ask 🙌🏻",

And they not sell the Davines shampoo here, so that's why my seb derm came back, and if  like me, you have redness and itchiness, I have a cream that works very well on my skin. the red patches disappear in two to 3 days with this cream, and it's Eucerin skin calming cream with natural oatmeal enriched. This cream save my life and my social life when the sebderm hit my skind hard. You have to put this cream as soon as your skin start to itchy, dont wait for the red to start.  \nAnd for the shampoo as I dont have my Davines shampoo in here, I make my own research about this shampoo and the active ingredient is the Selenium sulfide, and I find Selsun a shampoo that use that same active ingredient, so I give a try.",

Could kill 2 birds with one stone. \n\nI just got diagnosed 3 weeks ago. Derm gave me an antibiotic for 7 days and a corticosteroid cream but I did not use the cream because I’ve had issues with it before. Went back for a follow up because it kept getting worse and he prescribed isotretinon, I don’t have acne, I will not take that medication, I did it once and had to stop because side effects. \n\nI have rosacea and struggled for years until I had it under control. It lasted about 4 years and now sebderm. Which is only making my rosecea flare up. I tried a PHA toner only on my t zone, so it would gently exfoliate the area and the treatment would work better, then waited a day before starting Ketoconazole 2% (my idea) morning and night for 6 days and it is getting worse. So I’m stopping the ketoconazole. \n\nI’ve read that the sebderm could be autoimmune issue. So going to read more on that. I’ve been plant based for 10 years and I did notice a big change when I stoped ingesting dairy, now I don’t know , do I stop eating wheat or soy? \n\nThey say stop stressing and avoid the heat and sweat. Where I live is always hot and humid, so I need to stay inside all day in the AC; and the stress, I don’t know why doctors always say that for everything. If I could I would be stress free, it is not a choice. \n\nYou really game me some ideas that I will delve into. I really hope you find a cure.",

    "body": "Hello all,\n\nSo I started experiencing dandruff after the \"scalping\" of boot camp where everyone lines up, you get your head shaved in less than 2 minutes and you move on. This happened back in 2014. Since then, I have had mild to moderate dandruff but it has been quite an annoyance and since getting out of the military and moving back home, my dandruff has gotten worse. I have tried many different shampoos and treatments over the years. Regular H&S, Selsun Blue, T/Gel, etc. More recently, \n\nI have tried Tea Tree treatments and currently have Denorex (3% Salicylic Acid), H&S Clinical (1% Selenium Sulfide) and Biolage Scalp Sync (1% Pyrithione Zinc). If I use the Denorex, H&S Clinical and the Biolage in that order, I get reduced flakes and no itching for a day or two but have to use the process every time I shower. \n\nI was also recently given the advice from a hairstylist/cosmetician/etc whatever, that as a male, I over shampoo and that if I go a week without shampooing, my flakes would go away because my scalp's oil is allowed to rebalance or something and if I go two weeks, the itching will go away. I have tried this and it has only made the issue worse but has helped to show to myself that while my scalp is all jacked up (seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, dry scalp, who knows) I also have naturally oily hair. \n\nSo my question to the professionals here is what they would recommend? This has been such a constant issue for me that I am willing to try anything at this point and am currently working to try and get a referral to a dermatologist for it as well as some wonderful back acne that has sprung up recently.  Now, if you'll excuse me, off to take a shower and perform my process.\n\nP.S. - Can peppermint or other mints help or hurt your scalp? seem to notice a lot of shampoos for men have mint in them and maybe that might also be an issue.",

Turns out that they're all formulated to work on dandruff caused by some external factor - they're intended to kill fungus or treat psoriasis or whatever.\n\nTurns out that, at least for me, it was none of the above. I have dry skin. That's literally it. I started treating my scalp the way I treat my face - exfoliate and moisturize. I got a scalp scrub that I use in the shower and then I use oil on my scalp once I get out of the shower to moisturize the skin. You can get some nice oils that come in a dropper (so you can avoid making your hair look oily and gross) that might help. \n\nMy personal favorite brand for this is Ouai, but I'm not sure you'd like the smell - it's not exactly masculine. In that case, my dad uses Briogeo on his beard - both the scalp scrub and the scalp oil. The scrub is a little less gritty than the Ouai one, but the oil is my favourite.",

In the beginning I sprayed it on my scalp every other night & rinsed it out in the morning. Once the dandruff is under control, you can experiment with how often to do a ‘maintenance’ treatment, or just reapply as needed.

Both worked at first but then it came back a month later. I noticed it also leaves me when I go on vacation, usually to warm places by the sea 🧐\n\nLast doctor I had said it’s really due to stress, and gave me Flucloaxillan. He said to take a pill whenever I have stressful times at work coming up…. \n\nBarbers have told me to try lime juice, honey, and apple vinegar. On here I read about BP, haven’t tried it though. I saw 2 success stories with a complex formula of Selenium sulfide and Zithrin and another who used Oregano oil. Should I just try all of them until one works? Or is it really just based on stress. Should I start meditating and doing hot yoga? \n\nAny help or motivational stories help! Thanks!",

I posted this thread before: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/x7a6fu/help\\_with\\_hair\\_loss\\_due\\_to\\_sd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/x7a6fu/help_with_hair_loss_due_to_sd/)\n\nIt's been nearly 3 months and I just want to update everyone on regrowth is going.  \nFirst things first, I've managed to maintain a SD free scalp. relatively SD free as there were no scales, no itch, no inflammation but my scalp was rather greasy and oily but I don't reckon that inhibited regrowth.\n\nThe way I maintained a healthy scalp is by showering every 4 days and using zinc shampoo and selenium sulfide once a week. showering every day didn't help much.\n\nI didn't hop on fin or any DHT blocker and my thickness is slowly but surely coming back. The hair I already have has got thicker from the roots, and small new hairs are growing in all the thinned spots.\n\nThere is definitely progress and regrowth is very much possible unlike what a lot of people have told including my derm who said that MPB would inhibit all new regrowth even though i'm fairly young (19) also regardless of how long you've had SD, I had it since 13 and suffered from hair loss since then.\n\nAnyways have a good day everyone and best of luck!",

Now I know this is sub is about sebderm but honestly this you guys are the only ones that purely talk about malassezia despite it being an only sebderm sub. I started my routine around 3 months ago. It got a little better (maybe?idk) but it’s really hard to fight it. \n\nI have been on a candida diet for 2ish months, the first months was pretty strict, basically keto then a month ago I started to go a bit less strict as recommended by r/candida, now I also eat carbs like fruits(mostly) berries, I also eat things like, oats, psyllium husk, sweet potatoes etc. \nI also did a weight loss diet a year ago which was purely keto, it was pretty aggressive for 8 weeks, nothing really changed.\nFor us it seems to have started when I got a hair cur, my father (yes he cuts my hair) shaved the hair on the back of my neck and it got small red dots, we didn’t think of it much, I just washed my hair after and now here we are…\n\nFor skin care this is my routine:\n(If I go to the gym, I do this the moment I get home so about 15mins after finishing my workout)\n\nApple cider vinegar to destroy biofilm, leave it on about 3-5 mins\n\nSelsun blue selenium sulfide 1% shampoo and nizoral rotated every week (after apple cider vinger), leave on 10 mins\n\nI then rinse it with lukewarm water (never hot or cold)\n\nThen I dry it with a towel that is freshly washed every time\n\nThen I apply cerave moisturing cream the big tub (not the lotion, it’s not malassezia safe)\n\nThen I seal it in with pure c8 mct oil mixed with a little bit of pure tea tree oil\n\nI also use uv light therapy 10 minutes every other day and 15minutes of red light therapy 2x a week.\n\nI change pillow case every day and my pillows every week.\n\nI also treat fungus internally with anti fungal\n\nI think I am doing everything I can at this point or is there anything you could think of?\n\nI have been to a dermatologist 2 times about a year ago, once I got prescibed an anti-bacterial cream, didn’t do anything…then gave me anti-biotics and it became worse….I was so hungary all day especially for sugar which made me suspicious that this is indeed fungal. I also sent a sample of gunk that comes out of this bastards and sent it into laboratory and it came back as *nothing*….",
