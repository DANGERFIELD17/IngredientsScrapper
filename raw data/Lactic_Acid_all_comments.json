Why is Imane being punished for hers?",

    "body": "I used to be a fat and lazy guy and some day I decided that I need to change my life, started paying much more attention to what I am putting into my mouth. Just by changing my diet habits I was able to lose around 20kgs, my body has changed but unfortunately lots of problems from my previous self remained. Because I wasn't training at all during weight loss I became a skinny-fat person, I had a body with no visible muscles and lots of excess skin, I did not have much strength, and because of sitting office job I have been suffering from chronic back pain.\n\nBelieve me the thing have changed drastically for me when I started doing a weight trainings.I started with little fitness knowledge but I did not want to pay a ton for a personal trainer because I wasn't sure if I am gonna stay motivated. Luckily during lockdowns lots of fitness trainers started working online and currently there are tons of resources on YouTube that helped me to get started and guided me step by step in my transformation journey.\n\nI also did not want to go to gym, for me the the most important factor was that I was simply ashamed of myself. I felt that all those well-built guys are gonna stare at me and make jokes, so I decided that I will exercise at home at least 3 times a week.\n\nAt first I started with just weight of my body doing stuff like squats, lunges, push-ups, negative pull-ups. This set me on right track for success so I bought my first piece of equipment which was a 6kg kettlebell. I did couple of full body workouts found online and damn it was a blast, lactic acid all over my body. After some time I felt that 6kg is became to light for me so I increased the load and started training with 12kg. In order to add a bit of a variety I bought two resistance loop bands and incorporated those into my trainings. Couple of days ago I switched from 12kg kettlebell to 16kg in order to maintain progressive overload.\n\nSince I started doing the weight trainings I lost over 5% of body fat and developed muscles.Composition of my body has changed, I am now much more active and stretched, my body is no longer giving me as much movement issues as it used to. I strengthen my core, my posture looks way better as I do not slouch that much anymore, also my back pains ceased to exist. Apart from obvious health benefits body transformation gave me significant boost of self-esteem, I know that I look just a bit better but I feel million times better. This also positively affects my work and personal life because I am much more confident in myself.\n\nSo based on my personal experience I am giving you the best Life Pro Tip I can - start doing weight training, maybe it is gonna change your life the same way it changed mine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nMany of you replied about the gym mocking, the problem is rather imaginary and such guys are minority. The problem is that as na obese person with low self esteem you just subconsciously feel that you don't belong here. It is like being on suit party dressed in shorts and dirty t-shirt :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2:   \nI have added a comment with recommended YouTube channels that worked the best for me.",

Here is what I found to be the most effective for me:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@AlexCrockford](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexCrockford)\n\nI started my kettlebell trainings with Alex, it was great for start as he talks through the exercises and gives you  advices like \"squeeze your glutes\", \"drive your hips forward\" and so. As a novice I found those tips very helpful and it allowed me to establish a proper technique.\n\nHis 30 minutes full body as well as chest workouts are great for start.He also has a great  resistance bands band videos, can totally recommend push and pull routines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@DANIELPTFITNESS](https://www.youtube.com/@DANIELPTFITNESS)\n\nFor strength training I would recommend Daniel, he is not talking at all, you just go with the music and lots of positive energy. Every time I do the workout with him I am sweated like a pig. Bear in mind that in his workouts he is incorporating lots of lower body exercises such as lunges and squats which is good for maintaining proportional body, but hurts like hell for novice like me. After one of his routines I had to take a one week break :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@CarolineGirvan](https://www.youtube.com/@CarolineGirvan)\n\nFrom time to time I do training with Caroline, her kettlebell workout is basically HIIT, first time  I tried it she gave me really hard time an I struggled to finish it. She also has a lot of routines that does not require any equipment, which can be great for starters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@BullyJuice](https://www.youtube.com/@BullyJuice)\n\nI also tried arms video from Billy Juice.

I am not gonna give up until i reach 10 each side. \n\nI don‚Äôt know if this is the best strategy since everyone is always about variations and muscle groups.

One of the advantages of honey over traditional antibiotics is that it contains a complex mixture of antimicrobial compounds, such as bee defensins, enzymes and molecules derived from plants (e.g. methylgloxal and flavenoids). The nature of a complex mixture means it is difficult for bacteria to develop resistance, which is particularly important when treating infections involving multi-drug resistant bacterial strains (e.g. MRSA). \n\nAlthough honey directly kills bacteria (i.e. it is bactericidal), it also has interesting properties which counteract bacterial virulence factors. This includes preventing bacteria from producing exotoxins or forming drug-resistant biofilms (plaques). Some honeys also contains proteins which stimulate a patient's own immune system (a 5.4-kDa protein in manuka honey stimulates TLR-4, which elicits an innate immune response). \n\nFinally, there are advantages in applying honey itself to the wound. The high sugar content helps to debride dead and infected tissue by drawing out water by osmosis. This is particularly useful for treating chronic wounds like diabetic ulcers. \n\n[Here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24199801) is a nice review which outlines what I've said in more detail and with references. I think it's behind a paywall though so I've also hosted the paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7N2WLiBOCPwY0p0NTF1R2MtMHM/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nObligatory edit: Thanks for the gold stranger!",

Women with PCOS for example, can have testosterone levels that are 5x that of a typical woman.\n\nHowever, the rule that is preventing the Nambian runners (and others) from competing in the Women's division only applies to athletes with differences of sex development (DSD). This is a wide category for people who do not have typical male/female development and/or gonads. In the case of Castor Semenya, she is a 46XY individual that has external female genitalia but also has internal testes. DSD individuals can have testosterone levels that are comparable to a typical man for their entire lives. Semenya's \"natural-born advantage\" isn't an anomaly like Phelps's, as every typical male has XY chromosomes and testicles. The \"advantage\" she has is from competing only with women who typically do not have testes and do not go through male puberty.\n\nIn a nutshell, the IAAF has been trying to construct regulations that respects athlete's gender identities, while reconciling the fact that they have XY chromosomes, and typical male development.\n\nCheck out the 800m final at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

The women are competing in the category of \"be the best you can be without performance enhancing drugs or tools AND with a testosterone level below some value\". This category is commonly known as \"womens\" but that name isn't perfect because you can mentally identify as a woman with a testosterone level that would have you outcompete basically all women, and you would not belong to that category.\n\nYou could define \"women\" as XX chromosome, but that restricts XY women who took testosterone blockers from a young enough age, who should probably compete in the same bracket. And also XXY or various other intersex cases I know little about.\n\nYou could define \"women\" by their current genital setup, but that feels a bit arbitrary.\n\nYou could define \"women\" by giving them a survey of who they identify with and what gender they relate to in the culture they were raised in. That has tons of problems.\n\nSo it comes down to your definition of \"women\". The fairest one for competition seemed to be testosterone level, which sucks for these Namibian women who don't count as \"women\" by that metric.\n\nMaybe the whole idea of having a gender based or hormone level based category is flawed, but it seems important to a lot of people so there's no great option.

        "body": "In my view, the issue here is the difficulty of coming up with rules for athletes that can preserve fair competition that are evenly applied to everyone. The reason we traditionally had a differentiation between men and women‚Äôs sport is because men have different characteristics than women do that give them distinct physical advantages in many types of sport (e.g., higher bone density, different bone structure, muscle mass, etc.). If we didn‚Äôt differentiate between the two groups, then women would get dominated by men in most competitive sports and there would be little incentive for women to compete because they‚Äôd have no realistic chance of winning. Of course, these are all general statements and I‚Äôm not trying to say that some random dude off the street is capable of running a 100m sprint faster than the female gold medal winner at the Olympics, that‚Äôs obviously not true. But if you look at the performance of all of the male Olympic competitors in the 100m sprint, even the worst of those competitors will set a time that‚Äôs above or near the women‚Äôs world record time due to these inherent biological advantages. Obviously, we don‚Äôt want a situation where a female athlete trains for years to the peak of her abilities just to lose in a competition to someone who didn‚Äôt train as hard but wins simply due to an inherent biological advantage, so we segregated sports based on sex to preserve *fair competition*. This is the same reasoning behind banning athletes‚Äô use of performance enhancing drugs. \n\nOk, that‚Äôs all well and good but what about trans and intersex athletes? Don‚Äôt we want them to be able to compete too? Yes, of course we do. But we also want to be inclusive in how we do so (I.e., by not using biological sex as the determining factor) and also come up with a set of rules that preserves fair competition for all competitors. So how do we do that? Well, rather than differentiating based on what we observe (men tend to perform better than women do), we instead look to the source of that differentiation. As it turns out, one of the main driving forces in the disparity is testosterone levels. People with higher T levels have much higher physical performance (due to a variety of things that T-levels affect), and men have way higher testosterone levels than women (it‚Äôs not even close, even a man with extremely low T has higher T than a woman with extremely high T), so it makes for a pretty good metric. The advantage of using T-levels to differentiate is that it looks to the source of the performance gap, so it allows us to differentiate between, for example, a M2F trans person who transitioned years ago and has been on hormone treatment for a long time (eliminating the biological advantages from once high T-levels) and an M2F person who was a top-level athlete per-transition who only transitioned two weeks ago (and so still retains many of the physical advantages from their pre-transition biology). It also allows us to differentiate between different types of intersex people (it‚Äôs far more complex than just Xs and Ys, there are an enormous variety with different characteristics out there) as well. And best of all, this means that everyone gets to compete against people with similar baseline physical advantages to themselves, so no one feels like they‚Äôve trained for their entire life just to lose to someone whose inherent physical advantage is so strong that it‚Äôs impossible to overcome. \n\nUnfortunately, the T-level system has a few drawbacks, one of which is that a line has to be drawn somewhere. With any set of universally applied rules, there will be people that end up on what is arguably the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù side of the line, as you noted with the Namibian athletes in your post. The problem is that if you start making case-by-case determinations, you‚Äôre going to end up with a bunch of athletes complaining about unfair treatment (why did you let X compete in Y category but not me?) and a bunch of competitors complaining about unfair treatment in the opposite direction (why did you put X in the Y category, it‚Äôs unfair to make me compete against X because X has an unfair advantage over the rest of the Y category competitors). And that‚Äôs saying nothing of the inevitable politicking and back room dealing that‚Äôs going to infect every one of these case by case determinations. That‚Äôs not to say that the precise spot the line is currently drawn at is the ‚Äúright‚Äù place, this is a relatively new rule set and there‚Äôs always room for reevaluating and modifying the rules over time to try and create more fair results, but a line has to be drawn somewhere or we end up with a completely unfair competition (e.g., if every Olympic event was co-ed). \n\nNow to your final point about genetic differences between individuals. You‚Äôre right that Michael Phelps has a genetic advantage over basically everyone that‚Äôs not Michael Phelps because he has a body that‚Äôs essentially perfect for swimming. I think I can say with certainty that even if I trained every day from 5 years old, worked out perfectly, had Michael Phelps‚Äô swimming coach, and even took some performance enhancing drugs to boot I still wouldn‚Äôt be able to beat him in any swimming event. I could say the same thing for: me vs. any NFL player, me vs. any UFC fighter, me vs. any NBA player, me vs. any Olympic gymnast, etc. I simply don‚Äôt have great genes for athletics (for reference I‚Äôm a pretty lanky 6‚Äô1‚Äù normal dude in my 20s who was never good at any sports) and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve learned to accept. So to a degree, you‚Äôre right that because of the genetic differences between individuals there is and will always be an element of ‚Äúunfairness‚Äù in any competition between people. \n\nBut is there anything we can do about that? No, not really‚Ä¶ or at least there‚Äôs nothing we can do that still allows for much meaningful competition of any kind. If we were to try to account for *all* of the individualized differences between people, we‚Äôd end up with an enormous number of categories where each person ends up with a tiny pool of potential competitors (‚Äúin other news, Michael Phelps won gold in the Swimming God, aka the ‚ÄúPhelps‚Äù category of the 100m freestyle today, marking his 75th consecutive gold medal in this event‚Äù). Obviously I‚Äôm taking this to a bit of a logical extreme here, but even if the categories were a bit broader, having something like 10+ different categories for the same event at the Olympics would be kindof ridiculous and defeat the point of having a competition in the first place (seeing who‚Äôs the best at a particular thing). Some genetic imbalance between competitors is something I think that we as a society have learned to accept and think of as ‚Äúfair‚Äù, and I think it‚Äôs something the athletes in these competitions believe is fair as well, seeing as they still choose to compete (even when Michael Phelps is one of the people they‚Äôre competing against). We see this in all aspects of our daily lives as well, even though we don‚Äôt notice it. For example, people have varying levels of intelligence, which affects everything from our academic performance, to our career prospects and outcomes, to whether we win a chess game that we play with our friends (of course there are many other factors at play in all of these outcomes, but intelligence levels play a large role in our performance). All of these are forms of ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù, even though we may not think of them as such, yet we don‚Äôt tend to think of them as ‚Äúinherently unfair‚Äù and are still willing to compete. \n\n\n*TL;DR* and to conclude: there‚Äôs a balance to be struck here. Some differentiation in athletic competition based on natural genetic advantages is good because it allows for different groups of people to compete on a (relatively) fair playing field (e.g., the traditional separation of sport into ‚Äòmen‚Äôs‚Äô and ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs‚Äô categories) and provides an incentive for people in those groups to strive for peak physical performance and participate in athleticism generally. We also want to be as inclusive as possible so that everyone has the ability to participate in competition if they want to compete. \n\nAt the same time and for the same reason that we traditionally differentiated between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs sport, we want to make sure that everyone competes in a category that (generally) aligns with any inherent physical advantages they may or may not have as a result of their biological/genetic makeup so that no one is put at a distinct advantage or disadvantage relative to the other competitors. It turns out that measuring T-levels is a really great way to do this. Unfortunately, this also requires drawing a line somewhere for what T-level puts you into one category vs. another. There‚Äôs room for debate as to where that line should be drawn, but wherever it‚Äôs drawn there will invariably be some people who end up on one side of the line and think that they should be on the other side, and that‚Äôs unavoidable. But even though this may be somewhat unfair, the question is: unfair as compared to what? And here, the alternatives are either more unfair or eliminate meaningful competition entirely. No line looks like an Olympics where only men win medals. Too many lines and you end up competing with like 1 or 2 other people. And a case-by-case line invites back room dealing and politicking (which there‚Äôs already way too much of in the Olympics) and complaints from both sides about whatever result is reached. Thus, the T-level system is the best option. \n\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in reading more on the subject by someone with actual expertise who sits on the Olympics‚Äô anti-doping policy board, I would highly recommend reading some of the articles written by Doriane Lambelet Coleman. She did a series of articles on Reason that covers the science and the reasoning behind the current policy, and I think that you‚Äôll find it very informative.

The rule applies to distances 400m to 1600m if there's a line to be applied based on T levels shouldn't it be applied across the board? Furthermore in the case of the Namibian athletes and Caster Semenya their performances while significant in women's athletics would not even register at the high school boys level. So if these athletes under no limitations register performances consistent with what we see from elite female athletes and there's no reason to believe they've come by their performances through artificial means. It becomes difficult to take their bans at face value. Once again in the examples above not a single one of these athletes hold the world record in their respective events. Not one of them has performed anywhere near the men's level. Of course a decision needs to be made but as far as I can tell there's not really enough data to make the determination that IOC has unless they are willing to argue that all performances better than these hyper androgenous athletes were achieved either by other high in excess of \"normal\" testosterone athletes.",

It‚Äôs to foster a community and industry around these games. That means people want to compete in them and people want to watch them. In the extreme application of your argument (my understanding of it) men wouldn‚Äôt be banned from any sporting division and they‚Äôd outcompete women at every competition. That doesn‚Äôt sound very good for the community and industry. So we have an arbitrary rule for some competitions, no men, and now we‚Äôve expanded the sporting community by a lot. \n\nTo take this back to banning athletes for more subtle natural advantages like high test, to me it links back to the original goal. Is it good for the sport as a whole? To be honest idk. It seems test limits were introduced in an attempt to improve the sport by applying a concrete standard that accounts for non cis women that want to compete while trying to limit abuse or something. It‚Äôs an arbitrary standard with probably good intentions, but perhaps some negative outcomes worth reviewing. If it bothers enough people it can always be changed for the future.

        "body": "The whole point of having women's competitions in the first place is to penalize competitors with natural-born advantages (i.e. men) by excluding them. And if you're going to have women's competitions, then you have to draw the line between who is a man and who is a woman. For 99.9% of people this is clear cut, but there are certain people who blur the line between who is a man and who is a woman. Trans people occupy this space, but this issue is really entirely separate from the \"should transwomen be allowed to compete in women's sports\" debate.\n\nTake Caster Semenya as an example. She is biologically XY (male) with all the hormones and natural-born advantages associated with being male. But she was born with (what looks like) a vagina, so she was raised as a girl and nobody ever really thought about the issue until she started developing in a masculine direction. Through the benefit of her male physiology, she was able to dominate the women's competitions that she entered.\n\nWhen you get down to it, there are many methods which could be theoretically used to define who is eligible for women's sporting events, which each have their pros and cons:\n\n* Female genitalia\n* Self-identity\n* Whether the individual was raised as a woman\n* Female genetics (i.e. XX)\n* Hormone levels\n\nCaster Semenya would qualify as a woman under the first three checks and not under the last two. I think most people initially gravitate towards the 4th check (genetics) - which, again, would disqualify Semenya - but I feel the 5th one (hormones) is superior. First of all, there are many edge cases with testing genetics - there are XX and XY people yes, but there is also X0, XYY, XXY, etc. Yes you could go in and define these unusual chromosome make-ups as male or female (e.g. X0's count as female, XYY's count as male), but it's not always super clear which decision to make. With hormone levels you can make a clear distinction. And besides, imagine if Semenya were the same she is but had low male hormone levels - then she would have no advantage so the need to exclude her wouldn't exist. And finally, under the hormone system athletes like Semenya have a recourse - she can use medication to lower her male hormone levels - that wouldn't be available under a pure genetics system.\n\nAlternatively, if you used one of the first three systems (genitalia, self-identity, or birth identity) you'll end up having to do embarrassing inspections or having a system that is open to being gamed, or where \"ordinary\" women can't compete because they'll be in competitions that are dominated by competitors with male physiologies. Again - if you wanted to force women to compete against men then you could just abolish gender based divisions in sports, but obviously that would virtually eliminate any possibility for women to compete in sports at all.\n\nFinally, I think the Michael Phelps comparison is not the same. Male events are essentially open events - women may technically be barred but they wouldn't have been competitive anyway. When Phelps swam he was competing against the best swimmers in the world, period. The goal is to find the best swimmer overall, not the best swimmer who satisfies certain criteria.",

Then this morning I went to work where I have to stand all day (typical 8-5 retail) and it was so busy I forgot to drink any water.\n\nAfter work I went to the gym to work upper body, and by the last exercise my legs started cramping. A little at first so I didn't think too much of it. So I sat down to try to stretch out my legs and both my quads seized up and I was in the worst pain I think I've ever felt. I could not stand up. I couldn't even even unbend my knees. \n\nSo I just sat there drinking water thinking it will pass. Well 30 minutes pass by same pain, it did not pass. I was just sitting there in the middle of the gym during peak hours. I was starting to panic and I thought I had to go to the emergency room cause I thought my legs were not getting enough oxygen and they might have to amputate lol.. \n\nSo I called over to a trainer for help and he got the gym manager Chuck. Chuck gave me two ibuprofens and refilled my water bottle twice I think i drank like a gallon of water in 2 hours. \n\nChuck tried to help me stretch but I was in too much pain. Then he got a PVC pipe and just told me to roll it over my legs to get rid of the lactic acid. By this time the ibuprofens started kicking in which helped a bit and after two hours of rolling my legs out with the pipe I could stand up but legs still in pain. \n\nI just thanked Chuck and walked out of the gym and went home. \n\nHats off to Chuck who stayed with me through the whole thing. \n\nTL;DR: Did not drink water, went to workout, got cramps, felt worst pain in lifetime, Got help from Chuck \n\n",

It was like a mega Charlie horse in the muscle behind the thigh, but still above the bend in the leg. Is that a quad? I was in so much pain, began to realize I had to throw up, and my eyes started blacking on my way to the bathroom, nearly lost consciousness before I got to the toiled and hurled everything I had with the force of 57 Megatron's. It was awful as all hell. And my legs were sore for like a week. But the worst part was my vision getting blurred and going dark. Don't know what happened.",

I had forgetten my water jug, it was new construction so there was no running water and I didn't want to bother the neighbors. On my way home, 2 miles from my house, I passed out due to dehydration. It was a 2 way, I was going 40, veered into the left lane and hit a Chevy k2500 head on in my 98 Ford contour. I was airlifted to mass General hospital, it was a very close call. Ended up breaking my left knee, left hip, right femer, left shoulder, broke my neck C2, punctured both lungs, broke a bunch of ribs, severed my femeral artery, almost lost a leg. And to top it off the lady 2 cars behind mine, who was a nurse pried her way into my car and held my head to drain the blood out because I was chocking on it unconscious. Also broke my jaw, actually partially ripped off my face. Now I have a pretty badass joker looking scar on my face. Luckily I was 20 at the time and at that age you're made out of rubber bands and magic, so I snapped right back together for the most part. A year after it happend I working construction again. I'd say I healed 70% out of a 100%. I'm thankful to say the least. Stay hydrated Reddit",

You see, the other night, I finally finished the Not Forgotten quest line, and the strangest thing happened.  I sat down to dinner with my wife, and I looked over at her and said ‚Äúafter seven years of this, I‚Äôm just downright tired of this weak ass cooking.   Can‚Äôt you do any better???‚Äù  She started crying, and I didn‚Äôt even care.  Then, when she ran into the other room, I had the sudden urge to begin kneeling and standing up repeatedly on the kitchen table.  \n\nIt‚Äôs happening to me everywhere.  Kneeling, standing, kneeling, standing.  My legs are exhausted.  Even worse, just this morning, I went into the office and had a major presentation to our company‚Äôs board of directors.  When challenged about whether or not we‚Äôd meet our quarterly deadlines, I replied back and yelled ‚ÄúHow about you MEET DEEZ NUTS!‚Äù \n\nI then knelt and crouched repeatedly, dabbed, and walked out.  I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs gotten over me.   I‚Äôm now jobless, my wife has left to stay with her parents, and I‚Äôve got more lactic acid in my legs than Lance Armstrong after the Tour De France.  \n\nSomeone, please help.\n",

Although we want to go through FDA approval process to gain more credibility, the funds required are too high for us at this current stage of the company. Plus it makes much more sense to go down FDA approval once we are going the clinical route (diagnosing and treating), which we aren't at the moment. That said, we will definitely be visiting this proposal in the future.\n\nAre you applying to grants or an IRB?\n\n- Yes! We actually just finished out SBIR and in process of completing the application for an IRB.\n\nWhy don't you market this as a \"citizen scientist\" project? \n\n- Although we have a strong following with quantified self and citizen scientist, we believe the quickest way to advance this area is to get everyone involved. Unfortunately, not everyone classifies themselves as citizen scientist (which we believe they should!) and we want everyone to be included in our microbiome discoveries. \n\nAre you a medical diagnostic service / company? \n\n- No we are not. We offer microbiome testing, diet recommendations, and probiotics. We do not provide diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and cures for diseases. \n\nWhy do you have disclaimers about your product / service?\n\n- We are very clear that we aren't solving medical issues and providing \"cure-alls\". We are in no way a medical device / therapeutic company. So we have to say the following: Thryve is not intended to diagnose a disease or other medical condition, or tell you anything about your risk for developing a disease or condition in the future.  Thryve is not intended as a substitute for medical diagnosis or treatment, and should not be used as the basis for a diagnosis or treatment.  You should always consult your physician or health care provider about any health issues and before making any changes to your current care.\n\nDo you have any Ph.D's and medical staff? \n\n- Yes, we have 1 Ph.D Candidate in Bioengineering and another Ph.D from Stanford on our team and another industry veteran Ph.D from Stanford in Bioinformatics. \n\nWhat type of sequencing do you conduct?\n\n- We use Illumina MiSeq Machines to conduct 16s rRNA microbial sequencing on the v4 region that brings in roughly 10-15M reads per run. \n\nDo you keep my data and what are your guidelines on privacy?\n\n- We allow all our users 100% access to their data and fastq files (raw microbial genetic data) and everyone can choose to opt-in as anonymized research participants. Or they can always opt-out.\n\nDo you plan to partner with research / hospitals / academia in the future? \n\n- Absolutely. We are currently seeking out opportunities in this space to scale faster in our research and build credibility. We are small startup so it'll take some time. Bear with us! \n\nWhat makes you different from other companies in the space? Like uBiome, AmericanGut, etc...? \nFirst off, we love what uBiome, AmericanGut, and others are doing in this space. They have done an awesome job making microbiome science more mainstream, which means more research, funding, and discoveries. \n\n- More accurate collection method. We noticed that the current dry swab and liquid buffers on the market were not preserving the microbes very well. Microbes tend to change based on temperature, environment, etc... Thus, there was a lot of noise with what was being sample vs. sequenced. We did some internal tests to ensure that our collection method made our sequencing more accurate. \n\n- Diet recommendations. \n\n- Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (still in process), to summarize 3000+ microbiome research articles displayed side by side with your own microbial profile for more education and data for informed decisions. \n\n- Metabolism and Digestion metrics. We are utilizing [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) pathways and [FishTaco](http://borenstein-lab.github.io/fishtaco/) to provide insights to these parameters. \n\n- More personalized probiotics (still in process). We currently, offer a standard cocktail of strains in our probiotics. The hope is that we collect more data and provide customized probiotics based on the machine learning and data provided by our users. \n\n- Community Sharing and Journaling. We are building out a chatbot that asks our users daily about their lifestyle information (symptoms, diets, supplements, etc...) and that information gets funneled back into our system which makes the platform more powerful for users who submit their data, but also for everyone else on the platform. For instance, once we collect enough data users would be able to query the following [crohns_disease][USA][Male][top_3_overgrowth_bacteria][lifestyle_data_that_lowered_top3].\n\n- Yeast and Viruses. We have a yeast protocol coming out in Q3'17 and Viruses early '18\n\nAre you available internationally (UK, Canada, Asia, etc...)?\n\n- We will be in the next 3-6 months. Email us at support@thryveinside if you want to be updated. \n\nAre you snake oils salesmen or con men?\n\n- No. We honestly are working hard on the science and have gathered experts in the field of machine learning, bioinformatics, and biology to help us work toward a common goal. To learn about the microbiome and help others. Feel free to check up our team [here](https://www.thryveinside.com/team)\n\nDo you offer discounts for first time customers?\n\n- Yes, please email me at support@thryveinside.com or DM your email address \n\nHow do you feel after the AMA? \n\n- Fantastic. Honestly, it's been an awesome learning experience for myself and the team. We saw a split between 40% had negative sentiments about our product, 20% on the fence (need more credibility and data), 40% positive response and wanted to learn more. Although trolls are impossible to avoid on the internet, we genuinely believe there were scientist / concerned folks who had really great feedback and input. We thank everyone for their contributions. Maybe we'll do another AMA sometime in the future, once I crawl out of the fetal position :) ",

    "body": "UPDATE: Did you know citrus zest isn't acidic? I've been updating [this blog post](https://www.culinarycrush.biz/all/the-types-of-acidity) with details I've learned since I posted this to reddit.\n\nChances are, you are already incorporating acidity into your cooking. But are you thoughtful about ***which*** ***type*** of acidity to use for a given dish? Because lemon doesn't work with everything.\n\nIn this post, I describe the different types of acidity and how you can incorporate each into your cooking.\n\n# What's acidity?\n\nTo chefs, acidity is control. When used judiciously, acidity can brighten a heavy or fatty dish, bring attention to subtler flavors in a dish, or add complexity. Acidity can also diminish the perception of sweetness and bitterness or decrease the salt required to balance your dish.\n\nWhen adding acids to a recipe, it‚Äôs helpful to think of acidity as not a flavor but a *category* of flavors. There are different *types* of acidity, and each type has its pros and cons. Knowing which type of acidity to reach for (or knowing when to combine types of acidity to make a dish more interesting) will make your dishes more cohesive and thoughtful.\n\nSo let‚Äôs walk through the types of acidity ‚Äî what they are, what they‚Äôre good for, and where to find them.\n\n# Citric acid\n\nWhen most people think of acidity, they think of citric acid. That‚Äôs because citric acid is the primary acid in citrus fruits such as lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange, and yuzu.\n\nTo me, citric acid tastes like early morning sunshine. It‚Äôs bright, it‚Äôs assertive, and it can stand on its own. It is the most acidic (i.e. it is lowest on the pH scale) of the popular acids.\n\n***When to use citric acid***\n\nI prefer to use citric acid in dishes that I want to taste *fresh*. Think salads or white fish preparations. When saut√©ing vegetables, for example, you might find that your vegetables taste less vibrant after you‚Äôve cooked them; a squeeze of lemon can revive those cooked vegetables ‚Äî bringing out flavors that are more reminiscent of the vegetable in its raw form.\n\nCitric acid loses much of its characteristic tang with heat. You can use this to your advantage if hoping to subdue citric acid (e.g. cooking oranges with braised duck), or you can choose to add your citrus towards the end of the cooking process. The rinds of citrus tend to contain more citric acid, so don‚Äôt be afraid to zest.\n\n***Where to find citric acid***\n\nIn addition to buying citrus, you can also buy pure citric acid. This can be useful when you want to incorporate the effects of citric acid without the flavors (particularly the sweetness) that come along with citrus. I often use the powder in the *leche de tigre* for my ceviche when I want more control of the acid levels. This method enables me to marinate my raw seafood in a liquid like shrimp broth instead of using just citrus juice.\n\n# Lactic acid\n\nLactic acid is the primary flavor associated with lacto-fermentation. If you‚Äôve tasted pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, or yoghurt, you‚Äôve tasted lactic acid. Even sourdough bread‚Äôs acidity is due in part to lactic acid.\n\nI think of lactic acid like turning up the dimmer in your living room. It‚Äôs a softer, rounder glow than citric acid ‚Äî almost milky. I typically associate lactic acid with a bit of funkiness too, partially because it is usually derived from the fermentation of some other ingredient.\n\n***When to use lactic acid***\n\nI use lactic acid in dishes that need an uplifting note that is not distracting. Earthy broths or sauces seasoned with lactic acid still feel earthy but nonetheless sip lighter.\n\nI often add brightness to vegetable dishes by seasoning the vegetable with its lacto-fermented self. For example, when making celery root puree, I find that adding lemon (i.e. citric acid) is too noticeable ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt belong! So I season my celery root puree with fermented celery root instead.\n\n***Where to find lactic acid***\n\nThe best way to find lactic acid is to ferment something! Lacto-fermentation is easy, and it enables you to add subtle funk to your dishes. I also like to preserve lemons in order to mellow out the citrus‚Äôs citric acid with some lactic acid.\n\nBut you don‚Äôt have to rely on fermentation to add lactic acid to your dishes. You can also buy powdered lactic acid and incorporate it as needed. For example, I have a stash of lactic acid powder that I add to my yeasted pizza dough recipe to simulate a bit of the sourness of sourdough bread.\n\n# Acetic acid\n\nAcetic acid is the acidity you associate with vinegar or kombucha. It‚Äôs also found in trace amounts in sourdough bread (alongside lactic acid) and wines (especially natty wine or those described as having ‚Äúvolatile acidity‚Äù). Acetic acid is usually produced when alcohol is fermented in the presence of oxygen.\n\nI think of acetic acid like shining a flashlight on the heavier elements of your dish. Thanks in part to its pungent smell, it sticks out a bit, never quite mingling with the other ingredients.\n\n***When to use acetic acid***\n\nThe beauty of acetic acid is the accessibility of vinegar varieties. From rice wine vinegar to balsamic and everything in between, it‚Äôs easy to find a vinegar that complements your salad or main course.\n\nMore so than other types of acidity, vinegar begs for fats to complement its sourness and tame its smell. Emulsions of vinegar and butter or olive oil serve this purpose well.\n\n***Where to find acetic acid***\n\nI don‚Äôt just buy vinegars. I make them, too. Homemade vinegars (especially those made from fruits and vegetables) can have a thicker mouthfeel and sweeter taste, making them more balanced and almost a sauce on their own. The Noma Guide to Fermentation is an incredible resource for making your own vinegar.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm not planning months ahead with a custom vinegar, I also like to flavor otherwise neutral vinegars (like white wine vinegar). For example, before making mushrooms, I might throw mushroom scraps in with the vinegar I plan to use the next day.\n\nMost often, I opt for an extremely strong vinegar called √§ttika. From Sweden, √§ttika vinegar is four times as strong as regular vinegar, so it works well when you want to adjust acidity without imparting other flavors. I have a little spray bottle with √§ttika vinegar that I use to spritz a dish when I realize that it wasn‚Äôt as acidic as I was hoping.\n\n# Malic acid\n\nMalic acid is the acidity in a green apple. It‚Äôs also the principle acid found in apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, mirabelle plums, peaches, pears, and quince. A cheap cooking wine tastes like malic acid to me.\n\nI think of malic acid like sunshine through a stained-glass window. It‚Äôs subtler than citric acid in a way that I can only describe as warm.\n\n***When to use malic acid***\n\nI find that malic acid works well to bring life to meat-centric dishes ‚Äî particularly pork. It mingles well with sweetness, too, making it great for desserts.\n\nI don‚Äôt use malic acid much on its own, but I do try to incorporate it into dishes that are already acidic to add more complexity. A sauce with multiple types of acidity can taste like a whole fruit basket! For example, I often add both white wine and vinegar to butter sauces (i.e. I mix malic acid with acetic acid). Fermenting blackberries, similarly, is a means to add lactic acid to malic-rich berries.\n\n***Where to find malic acid***\n\nI keep some reduced white wine handy to adjust the malic acidity in dishes. Otherwise, I keep powdered malic acid on hand to adjust the liquids I use in my ceviche.\n\n# Other acids\n\nThe four acids I‚Äôve described only scratch the surface. But the other acids don‚Äôt have as many culinary uses.\n\nOxalic acid (found in wood sorrel, chives, and purslane) certainly comes in handy (and is reminiscent of acetic acid), but excessive consumption of oxalic acid can be toxic. Tartaric acid plays an important role in lowering the pH in wine production, and it‚Äôs mixed with baking soda to become baking powder. Meanwhile, ascorbic acid is common too ‚Äî because it's vitamin C!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHope this was helpful. And when life gives you lemons, be sure to think twice about whether that‚Äôs the acidity life really needs right now.\n\nEdit: A couple folks asked about the blog where I post similar thoughts on food. Only a few weeks of content so far! But it is [here](https://www.culinarycrush.biz/).",

    "body": "There seems to be a lot of interest in ceramides and not a lot of transparency on the part of skincare companies, so I thought I‚Äôd make this post. Super long, so bear with me.\n\nFull disclosure: I work in the industry.\n\nTL;DR - most products that are marketed as having ceramides have a ridiculously low amount and in the wrong ratios when combined with cholesterol and free fatty acids, which they ideally should be combined with. They may still work for you because lotions and creams are generally moisturizing, but the ceramides are likely adding nothing. Hopefully skincare companies will become more transparent and honest as time goes by and more consumers demand it.\n\n*\\[Edit: I did not expect such an overwhelming response! Because there have been so many questions about this, I want to emphasize - many of the products mentioned in this thread have* ***worked very well for many people***, and they should\\* ***continue to use the products that work for them***\\*. *Are the concentrations too low to reflect some seminal research findings regarding ceramides? Many times, yes. Are the molar ratios incorrect? Many times, yes. Does that mean that the product will not work for you? No. It just means that it's a bit dishonest to market the product on the back of research findings that the product does not actually reflect.\\]*\n\n**What are ceramides, and why are they beneficial to skin?**\n\nCeramides are waxy substances that, in part, make up the ‚Äúmortar-like‚Äù barrier in between the ‚Äúbrick-like‚Äù corneocytes that prevents skin from losing water (transepidermal water loss, or TEWL). The other major components are cholesterol and free fatty acids. Together, these components form a liquid crystal structure that is very efficient at preventing water loss. The application of this would be for skin suffering from atopic dermatitis, skin that is adjusting to retinoid usage, or skin that has been stripped by aggressive treatments or environment factors (aggressive acid treatments, stripping cleansers, very cold or dry weather, etc.).\n\n**Do ceramides need to be combined with cholesterol and free fatty acids to work?**\n\nIn short, probably. There is research by Mao-Qiang and Feingold (they are experts on this topic and have a number of very good papers on this - google their names and ‚Äúphysiologic lipids‚Äù and you can even see some of their full papers as pdf‚Äôs) that indicates that when any one of these components is used in isolation of the others, or in the wrong molar ratios, it actually delays repair of the barrier.\n\n**What ratios are ideal for ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids for barrier repair?**\n\nThe research indicates that a 1:1:1 to 3:1:1 molar ratio of any of the components works to repair the barrier. Some research shows different populations benefiting more or less from ceramide, cholesterol or free fatty acid-dominant blends. For example, aged skin benefits more from a cholesterol-dominant ratio, while infants benefit more from a free fatty-acid dominant ratio, and eczematic skin benefits more from a ceramide-dominant ratio. All three work for irritant contact dermatitis (caused by aggressive treatments, weather, friction, etc.), which is good news, since most people in the general population looking for ceramide-laced products would fall into this category.\n\n**Can I depend on the fatty acids found in plant oils to provide the free fatty acids in a product?**\n\nYou could, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Most of the free fatty acids in plant oils are bound to triglycerides, meaning that it must go through an enzymatic process for the fatty acids to be freed. That process is not especially predictable (microflora on the skin seems to affect this as well, such as those suffering with malassezia overgrowth) and can vary between people. The free fatty acids should ideally be provided in predictable, precise quantities to ensure a proper ratio to the ceramides and cholesterol. Labmuffin has a good post on her blog about this as well, so look there if you want more detail.\n\n**What % of ceramides is useful to skin?**\n\nThe research by Mao-Qiang and Feingold shows that a total combined concentration of 1% to 1.6% of ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids is capable of repairing the barrier. When examining the optimal 3:1:1 molar ratio, researchers they tested a total concentration of 1%-1.2%.\n\nThat means at an optimal 3:1:1 molar ratio at a concentration of 1-1.2%, with any component being dominant, the ceramide concentration needs to be .3%-.7%.\n\nIt‚Äôs useful to note, at this concentration, the lipid mixture outperformed petrolatum by the 2-hour mark, which is impressive since petrolatum is often considered the gold standard in preventing transepidermal water loss.\n\n**How does a ceramide/cholesterol/free fatty acid combo differ from an occlusive such as petrolatum?**\n\nPetrolatum acts as a physical barrier to moisture loss (occlusive), and provides about a 50% recovery from baseline immediately upon application to skin. Over an 8 hour period, this stays pretty consistent, with just a minor drop by the 8 hour mark.\n\nA proper blend of ceramides/cholesterol/free fatty acids, however, does not provide an immediate physical barrier to water loss. Instead, these lipids get incorporated into the skin‚Äôs natural pool of lipids, where it then is incorporated into the liquid crystal structure that forms skin‚Äôs natural barrier. This takes time, which means that the benefit is delayed. However, by the 2-hour mark, an optimal 3:1:1 blend outperforms petrolatum, providing a 55% recovery (vs 50% for petrolatum), and by the 8-hour mark, the difference is even more dramatic (90% recovery vs 40% recovery for petrolatum). It‚Äôs notable that combining the two strategies provides the benefits of both immediate partial relief and long-term recovery for a damaged barrier.\n\n**Okay, so what products follow the research?**\n\nUnfortunately, not many. Most companies use a raw material blend called SK-Influx, which is a combination of an emulsifier (sodium lauroyl lactylate) along with 1.5% ceramides, .5% cholesterol, and 3.5% free fatty acids and .5% phytosphingosine, per the manufacturer‚Äôs own document ([https://personal-care.evonik.com/product/personal-care/downloads/downloads/sk-influx.pdf](https://personal-care.evonik.com/product/personal-care/downloads/downloads/sk-influx.pdf)). They sometimes, more vaguely, say that it has ‚Äú2.5% active matter‚Äù, but they are adding .5% cholesterol and .5% phytosphingosine in addition to the 1.5% ceramides to get to that number.\n\nThe maximum recommended usage for SK-Influx is 15%, which would result in a .2% final ceramide content. This gets close to the .3% ceramide content supported by the research mentioned above. However, SK-Influx is more typically used in concentrations of 1-5%, which would yield .015%-.075%. That is approximately 10x less than what researchers showed to be effective.\n\n**How does SK-Influx fare in terms of the molar ratio of cholesterol, ceramides and fatty acids?** Simply calculating the ratio between the weights % of the components to calculate ratios is different from molar ratios, which factor in the molar mass of each material. Using the specific molar mass of cholesterol (386.65g/mol), an average molar mass of ceramides (700g/mol), and a typical molar mass of fatty acids commonly used in skincare, such as linoleic, linolenic and stearic acids (280g/mol), we can calculate the molar ratios of the lipids in SK-Influx. This results in *1 part cholesterol, 2 parts ceramide, and 10 parts free fatty acids, or 1:2:10*. This is quite far from the 1:1:1-3:1:1 ratio recommended by research!\n\nu/the_acid_queen *and* u/BurgundySnail  *pointed out that it is hard to pinpoint what the source of the free fatty acids are in Sk-Influx from looking at the ingredient list, and* u/the_acid_queen *kindly pointed us to the  document linked below, which despite not explaining the source of free fatty acids in the blend, nonetheless states in bullet three under \"properties,\" that the product is a \"a concentrated mix of different types of ceramides, cholesterol, free fatty acid and phytosphingosine\". The likeliest source of free fatty acids is the sodium lauroyl lactylate, which at acidic pH's, breaks down into lactic acid and lauric acid, the latter of which being a free fatty acid.*\n\nlink\\*:\\*[https://personal-care.evonik.com/product/personal-care/en/products-solutions/concepts/pages/tattoo-care.aspx?valueId=20409&productId=31225&download=custpropfile](https://personal-care.evonik.com/product/personal-care/en/products-solutions/concepts/pages/tattoo-care.aspx?valueId=20409&productId=31225&download=custpropfile)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this mean that all the products containing SK-Influx on the market will damage your barrier? Probably not - the concentrations of the lipids are too low, and most products will contain a number of occlusives, humectants and emollients that will act act as a partial barrier to water loss. However, it does mean that the dusting of ceramides in those products are mostly for marketing purposes and provide little to no functional benefit.\n\nPopular products that use SK-Influx:\n\n* Cerave (most of their ingredients lists suggest they‚Äôre using SK-Influx at a 1% concentration or less, meaning .015% ceramides or less)\n* Drunk Elephant (Lala Retro Whipped Cream with Ceramides, C-Tango Eye Cream - both ingredient lists suggest they‚Äôre using SK-Influx at a 1% concentration or less, meaning .015% ceramides or less)\n* Stratia Liquid Gold (especially concerning because the product is often marketed as having the ideal 3:1:1 ratio which SK-Influx is ridiculously far from; the test version on the founder‚Äôs blog originally used 10% SK-Influx, resulting in .15% ceramides, but the current ingredient list suggests they‚Äôre using it at a 1% concentration or less, meaning .015% ceramides or less). Edit: u/the_acid_queen clarified that it's at a 10% concentration, meaning the total ceramide content is .15%, not .015%).\n* Paula‚Äôs Choice (Omega+ ~~serum~~ moisturizer and all of the other products touting ceramide content; most of the ingredient lists suggest they‚Äôre using SK-Influx at a 1% concentration or less, meaning .015% ceramides or less) (thank you for the typo catch, u/Gopoj!)\n* Chemist Confessions Mr. Reliable (props to them for telling you straight up it‚Äôs 3% SK-Influx, meaning it has .045% ceramides so still low but better)\n\nAgain, you may use and love some of these products. Just saying you‚Äôd probably love them just as much without the ceramides. One of the few exceptions that is commonly available is Skinceuticals‚Äô Triple Lipid Restore moisturizer, which at 2% ceramides, 4% cholesterol, and 2% free fatty acids gives a 1:4:3 molar ratio, which is not perfect but not bad. However, the total lipid concentration (8% vs \\~1% shown to be effective in the research) and price ($128 for 1.6 oz) are overkill for most.",

        "body": "I love posts like this! Thank you so much for taking the time to share your expertise. I do have some questions about the conclusions being drawn, hopefully you can help clear things up?\n\n1. I'm a little confused by the statement that 1-1.6% ceramide/cholesterol/fatty acid is \"capable of repairing the barrier.\" The barrier isn't something that can be described in an on/off way as either repaired/working or broken. It's constantly in flux - at some periods it's stronger and has higher concentrations of lipids and less permeability, and at other times it's weaker and has less lipids and more permeability. So, at what point are they claiming that the barrier is \"repaired\"? And doesn't that depend on exactly how damaged the barrier was to begin with? Or are they talking about a percent improvement?\n2. Are ceramides dose dependent? In other words, do concentrations less than 1-1.6% have no benefit on the barrier, or just less of an effect? If that effect exists, does the amount of benefit increase proportionally to the amount of ceramides included, or does it increase at a different rate?.\n3. Did that research take into consideration the effect that other ingredients may have on ceramide penetration and efficacy? For example, apparently there are a number of ceramide promoters and augmentors, including but not limited to: niacinamide, lactic acid, phytosphingosine, proanthocyanidins, glycerrhetinic acid, MultiVesicular Emulsion Technology, and so on, and these ingredients are included in a lot of the products you mentioned. Taking that into consideration, I was thinking quantities less than 1-1.6% could be effective.\n4. I'm curious as to what you thoughts are on [QV Intensive with Ceramides - Light Moisturising Cream](https://www.qvskincare.com.au/product/qv-intensive-with-ceramides--light-moisturising-cream)? Based on the ingredients list and the fact that ceramides are listed after NaOH, I'd assume it's a less than 1% concentration... but the manufacturer published a study showing decreases in atopy compared to vehicle, and I'm sure Valeant did similar tests with Cerave and trans-epidermal water loss when developing MVE.\n\nAgain, thanks for your insight, I hope you might know the answer to some of these questions!",

This results in 6 parts cholesterol; 1 part ceramides; and 58 parts fatty acids, or a 6:1:58 molar ratio. This is quite far from the 1:1:1-3:1:1 ratio recommended by research!\n\nThis is how I counted:\n\nFor the given percentages, I assumed that the total mass is 100, and gave grams instead - so it gives me 0.5g of CHOL, 1.5g CER, 3.5g FA.\n\nTranslated grams into mol, by dividing grams by molar mass: 0.5/386=**0.001295** mol CHOL; 1.5/700=**0.00214** mol CER; 3.5/280=**0.0125** mol FA;\n\nThe smallest number is from cholesterol so this is the 1 in ratio; 0.00214/0.001295=1.6 for ceramides and 0.0125/0.001295=9.65 for FA.\n\nSo i get **1:1.6:9.65** ratio of cholesterol:ceramides:fatty acids. \n\nWhere was I wrong in the calculations? How did you get 58 number? Yes I see it's still far from ideal, but not that drastic as yours. And this is assuming that fatty acids in fact are there, which I am still not clear on.",

It's not an ingredient you see manufacturers listing percentages so I always thought that was interesting. Now I wonder if I'd get the same benefit from using Vanicream or some other cheaper generic cream without the ceramides compared to CeraVe....hmmmm lol.\n\nI also found the discussion about overlap between dermatologists vs. cosmetic chemists really interesting and I appreciate that you kept a professional and nuanced perspective on it. I suspect this is partially why many products that use particular \"wonder\" ingredients aren't super effective, though my knowledge of the literature and skin science is lacking.

Something that really helped me get things under control however is a lactic acid supplement that I take every other day. It comes in a powder form and you dissolve it in water, wait for a minute and then drink it on an empty stomach. \n\nAbout a week ago I had just mixed the supplement with water and had the glass sitting on the counter while I was preparing my breakfast. My roommate (21m) came into the kitchen and asked about the mysterious liquid in the jar. I replied that it's a supplement for gut and vaginal health that I take regularly. He seemed a bit confused but said \"ok\" and continued doing whatever he was doing in the kitchen.   \nYesterday I was again preparing breakfast with the supplement sitting on the counter when the same roommate entered the kitchen again. He noticed the glass and said I should start taking the supplement in my room instead of the kitchen since that makes him think about my vagina. Apparently he thought it was invasive that I told him what specifically I was taking the supplement for. I told him that I'd continue preparing it in the kitchen and that I was also storing my tampons relatively openly in the bathroom so he should be aware of the fact that I have a vagina anyways. \n\nNow I'm not stupid - I get that it's kind of direct to say my supplement is for vaginal health. I do also think however that we shouldn't continue stigmatizing talking about that sort of stuff. Vaginas are an organ like any other and I don't think anyone would care if I had said the supplement was just for gut health only. It's not like I started talking about my history of vaginal infections in great detail when he asked about the supplement so I don't think it was invasive or that I shouldn't consume it openly anymore. He did seem pretty uncomfortable however - so AITA?",

Your body takes the energy from food, but it can't use all of it so you poop the waste out.\n\nThe different parts of your body are like little mini bodies. They take in energy but then make waste. If too much waste builds up too quickly then that part gets tired. You need time and rest to clear which part of your body you are using.\n\nYour brain is what you use for thinking. When you think hard or have to focus, that means you use up more energy. If you use more energy you will make more waste. But the brain is a little different compared to other parts of your body. It can't clear up the waste very fast from resting alone, you need to sleep to clear the waste up faster. \n\nAnd that's why you need to sleep.

You can trick your brain and go beyond your normal capacity though, just like you can always push a lit bit harder physically, but the risk of damage or injury increases. \n\nHere's a bit of detail: when your brain uses ATP molecules to power itself, the molecule is cleaved into 3 phosphate molecules and the adenosine part is leftover. This adenosine part then gets to receptor sites -- shaped to accommodate this specific molecule -- and activates them, and this causes the feeling of drowsiness and mental fatigue. So this is essentially a safety mechanism in your brain, similar to how your muscles will not be able to work over a certain threshold to prevent physical injury. It is always possible to go beyond your physical or mental capacity through external aides, but there is risk of damage.

As the special chemistry runs low and the waste builds up, your brain cells find it harder and harder to do their job.\nRest allows your system to wash some of the waste away and recharge some of the special chemicals.\nSleep is a special mode of super-wash and super-recharge that your brain really needs, like a spring clean and restock of the shelves.\n\nEDIT: Also regarding muscle fatigue specifically.... lactic acid is certainly a major source of medium term muscle fatigue (24 hours to a few days in extreme cases). But immediate muscle fatigue - eg can do no more reps at the gym - is actually due to exhausting the neurotransmitters in the neuron-muscle gap at the local muscle site. That's why it takes a minute or two rest to go again, the ions (building blocks for the neurotransmitters) need to recharge. It's also why higher electrolytes and magnesium in the body helps slow the onset of muscle fatigue and allow faster recovery.\n\nI'll quote the scientific journal about this if I can dig it up.",

Here is a story that is important to me:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor 23 years (and not knowing it for 17 years) I had a symptom of uncorrectable mental fatigue....feeling like I'd been several days without sleep, even on first waking up. It destroyed large parts of my life. After 17 years the disease 'hepatitis C' was discovered, and I learned that I had it, but there was no cure. Seven years later a cure was found, and my terrible mental fatigue was cured the first time I got a good night's sleep. My liver had been unafffected by the virus.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMost doctors never believed what a minority of hep C people were telling them, that no amount of rest or sleep is clearing the mental fatigue. They attributed it to 'depression'. But if you google search what all the hep C people said where the virus didn't attack their liver, and who had a high viral load, almost all of them mention that sleeping didn't do anything to decrease mental tiredness. And that this was *important* and affected day-to-day functioning. And you'll read doctors saying, well, these are probably ex-drug abusers, or they are probably depressed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReason I mention that is, if I'd asked the doctors  \"what causes my mental fatigue\" they would have said, \"Your symptoms are caused by depression.\"  They don't know, and the most anyone ever said would be things like \"It might be related to seratonin.\"",

It is more likely that higher processes in your brain cause your muscles to fatigue intentionally to not cause injury to the muscle. It also is likely to be a multi cause scenario where many things cause the muscle to fatigue. For instance, production of lactic acid, lack of oxygen, and other information are picked up by the PNS and sent to the CNS, in which the brain then tells the muscle to fatigue because it could reach a point of injury.\n\nSource: physiology 290 class, prof was very careful in trying to answer this question because to an extent, it‚Äôs still quite unknown.

We had not had any problems that I was aware of. So as I'm realizing what is happening. As fast as you see a lightning bolt in a thunderstorm. I stopped her and asked her. I said hey hey what's up wait a min before I got here to pick up our daughter did you have a conversation with the me inside of your head and you are now directing the way it went in there on the me out here. She laughed and said yeah. I was like wow you can't do that. She kept on though. Is that ok enough for you. Or do I need to keep going. How does one tell another that they are ok without a preload response. So easy to say what ever is easy because it's not yours it was learned through other people. I was raised by a vet and I do not act anything like him I did not come from where he came from. I do not form so easily by what is outside of me I am me and can only be me I don't want to do anything that anyone around me is doing and I get confirmation every day that I am still me.

I know I fell like Clark Kent always bumping  into people and pushing up my glasses when I need to answer someone.When I , myself  am left looking at every little detail . Seeing it from all different angles. From the other persons point to  taking myself to the point that my understanding is something like a object that is always in motion till I meet the unmovable spirit. In turn a lot of things I am aware of. Stress is the main factor it will do something that no drug will. To me it feels like being what I would have to imagine what it would be like to go into a black hole from what NASA and only NASA will ever tell me about a black hole. I am not going to debate anyone about the perception of my reality. I am on a different world. I have been judged by so many. I gave this guy a few dollars  the other day and told him I was not doing it because I felt sorry for him or nothing. He thanked me likehe appreciated that part but then I said I have not been real far from where he was but I stopped. I know he could have took that in any way if he didn't  have an opinion about my scrambled information that was coming out of my non social mouth and let it in to his feeling of the moment that he had that would give birth to what I like to see it as the opinion . He probably thought that I had what looked like a nice car and didn't think I have ever been homeless myself. I'm had to be ok with it because I know what my daughter  who is about to turn 5 and knows daddy because he exhausted every resource i had to to contend with people , my family her mother and every one else the crazy hospital not because I was crazy because when you drive for 3 months straight in your  share ride app in what is not ur car because someone just rear ended you at a red light and you were working at a place with airplanes that everyone knows in cusomes  just received full custody of my daughter  and I just couldn't recover after such a loss so when I let her get to her mom who I thought we were going to do stuff together to be a family and a year later hear we are after I lived at the homeless shelter and I don't even want to go into all the events that took place before all thos when my daughter was one and her mom took her and ran off to Panama city Florida to try and live with her biological father who she had just met and and it broke my heart when she called and told me she was come back closer to me but I cried myself to sleep for two weeks before I realized your brain does not like that at and me and the spirit well I use to sing songs to it when I was a kid yes he is my God. Don't even go their with me it's pointless i can only hope their are ppl like me if your header had not been something I have been going to the university of the hardest knocks you would never know this you would just think i was a positive logical  thinker, self aware that i have emotions and that they are not me. My ability to understand.  Well let's just say I have noticed when I needed to sit still because I felt like the sun and I needed to be as still as water in a pond and let my thoughts run free like the Rapids With all that to me. I'm  left to believe that I'm all alone in my little world no matter what I do at this moment.  So thank you for that if I lost you I'm sure some professor giving some lecture on some on line class. I can see with out seeing and I am free of having to explain myself because I am in motion just like the cosmos thanks NASA when can I go see that the earth is round and not flat under my feet. I finally said I know what I wanna be when I grow up but I was grown up. Can you guess. Make yourself blessed not be blessed I don't know how you would to that but I can be quiet.......",

It happens, right?\n\nMy shitty Toyota jumped the curb, and I was out the door without even putting it in park, sprinting with everything I had. \n\nFifteen years of baseball and four years of rugby had taught me how to explode and cover a short distance quickly.\n\nBut that was a far away time in a long-gone place.  I was run down and ragged these days.\n\nApparently I still had a step in me.\n\nThe incidental benefit of adrenaline is it doesn‚Äôt leave lot of room for second-guessing. Instinct snaps up the controls. We‚Äôd probably all be better if that were the case most of the time. \n\nNot much thought went into spearing him right in the side and slamming him onto the gravel path. \n\nI could hear what I thought was sobbing behind me. It felt like blood was pulsating in my ears, denying me my hearing. The whole world sounded like if Charlie Brown‚Äôs parents had done a few whippits. His screams were inaudible ‚Äúwah-wah‚Äôs.‚Äù\n\nThe attacker certainly had size on me. But I‚Äôd spent a good chunk of my life getting into fistfights. Even won a few, too. \n\nHeaven hates an Irish temper.\n\nThe element of surprise and my ruthlessness really saved the day.\n\nHe tried to use his superior size to flip me over as my knees dug into his chest. I drove down, using my stocky frame and low center of gravity to hold tight, and slammed a fist into his exposed neck. \n\nI ignored his gasps and flailing. A punch to the nose. Now the eyes. \n\nSpasming like a salted slug, he finally managed to fling me off him. \n\nHe was off like a rocket, tearing into the night. Tough piece of shit, I remember thinking. My gut said chase him down. The hunter following the bloodened tracks of a deer leaking from a body shot. \n\nBut when I looked back in saw her, I knew I couldn‚Äôt. \n\nShe looked‚Ä¶off. There was fear, so much fear, but it felt like a mask. Sobs that felt like a recording. Professions of thanks that seemed overly enthused. A pantomime.\n\nShe flung her arms around me. I called the police. They came and took her statement. Sally Rigby was her name.  A senior, doubling majoring in computer science and Chinese language. \n\nSally Rigby was the future, and I, a shell of a person, a glorified worm, an unplugged toaster, had saved her. \n\nWe told the police everything we knew. \n\nHe was black, and given Sally‚Äôs adorably white disposition, meant the police would actually pursue this with vigor. They found his knife in a bush a few feet from where we tussled. I didn‚Äôt get a great look, but it appeared weirdly ornate. Like a dagger in a cornball movie trying to convince the audience the weapon is ancient and ambiguously ethnic. \n\nSally never left my side. Beaming up at me. Holding my arm. Thanking me in that weird Stepford Wives meets Tom Cruise‚Äôs empty eyes sort of way for saving her from inevitable rape and death. \n\nThe police took our information, and Sally asked for my number before they took her to get checked out at the hospital. I figured that was the end of it, unless they caught the creep, and I had to testify.\n\nApparently, four girls had gone missing on campus in the last two months. The always loathsome police slapped me hard on the back, saying I might‚Äôve just beaten down a serial killer. They dug under my nails for DNA. \n\nI wish that had been the end of it. God. Be grateful for all the things you don't know. \n\nThe next day Sally began texting me. She oscillated between discussing her trauma and endlessly thanking me. I felt obliged to muster real responses. She had suffered something truly horrible. I might not have a kernel of faith in humanity, but I wasn‚Äôt a monster. \n\n*I* wasn‚Äôt. \n\nBy the second day, the texts her turned flirtatious. Compliments I would never expect. Questions about my life, my past, my hobbies, my beliefs. \n\nI called her. I was worried one of two things was happening; either she felt she owed me something, to make me feel good, or she was becoming attached to me as a sort of trauma response. \n\nNeither was a good path, so I wanted to nip it in the bud as gently as possible. \n\nThis had nothing to do with delusional narcissism on my part. I took this line of thinking, dear reader, in large part because, well, in no possible other scenario would Sally be interested in me. \n\nAnd who could possibly blame her? She was twenty-three, more than ten years my junior. Blonde, fit, brilliant, witty, gorgeous, vivacious. I was a broke down car that somebody threw a shitty paint job on. Nihilism, whisky, and a degenerate lifestyle do not a pretty visage make. And surly to boot.\n\nThe plan derailed quickly. Sally insisted we go out, that night. A vibrant restaurant and bar I sometimes picked up orders at. A sea of humans bolstering plastic smiles with the false hope only ethanol can provide. \n\nEvery time I tried to break through to explain, she talked over me with greater exuberance. \n\nFinally, I snapped. \n\n‚ÄúSally. I‚Äôm like, forty pounds overweight, rundown, not particularly pleasant, way too old for you. You don‚Äôt owe me anything. You do the right thing because it‚Äôs the right thing. I don‚Äôt want someone to go out with me out of obligation.‚Äù\n\nThere was a long pause. It felt angry, pregnant with rage. \n\n‚ÄúI genuinely like you, Pappy.‚Äù \n\nI‚Äôll spare you the masturbatory recounting, but she heaped an avalanche of compliments, putting up a fierce argument oozing with sweetness. \n\nI gave in and met her two hours later. \n\nI never imagined the date from Hell being taken in the literal sense.\n\nWe never even made it inside. \n\nWhile we waited for a table, our conversation took one wild turn after another. So many common interest and hobbies. Similar perspectives, though hers a significantly softer version. An uncomfortable amount of similarities coming out of left field. That should have been a red flag, but the Venus flytrap doesn‚Äôt go hunting, now, does it? \n\nPappy the fly, they call me. \n\nA few whisky sours while we waited and pretty soon, we were slammed up against a wall in the alley. While I was kissing her neck and running my hand slowly up her leg, she whispered in my ear. I expected a sensual moan, maybe a little dirty talk. \n\nNope. NOPE.\n\nI jumped about four feet back. \n\nWhat she said didn‚Äôt make much sense then, but it was her voice. \n\nImagine the screech of an angry goat mixed with the hoarse gasp of lifelong smoker battling emphysema. Now throw in the squeal of a slaughtered pig and a demonic baritone that would have bested Johnny Cash. *THAT* is what I heard in my ear, and *THAT* is why I jumped back.\n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here. And I want you to watch what you wrought, you empty thing.‚Äù\n\nI stared at her as she transformed. \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt like the movies. Bones didn‚Äôt stretch and squeal. Skin didn‚Äôt inflate and shift. It didn‚Äôt have the feel of slow animation. \n\nOne minute a solid ten in a slinky black dress was there, and the next, Hell's special little abortion stood in her stead.\n\nMy first thought was, I just made out with a fucking gorilla.\n\nAnd that I‚Äôd be the first person to say that in retrospect literally.\n\nA seven-foot ape completely covered in crisscrossing black and white hair glared me down. But this wasn‚Äôt *George of the Jungle*. This was an acid trip gone horribly awry. \n\nFour eyes, each a different color. Red, sapphire blue, a deep purple, yellow, in a perfect line across the forehead. An impossibly large mouth with a single tooth descending nearly six inches out of the creature‚Äôs mouth clicked against it‚Äôs twin that shot up from its lower gums. A single horizontal slit for a nose, and with every fresh breath, black smoke came pouring from it. Where ambidextrous paws should be were massive, humanoid hands, almost comically large. The creature rested on the outer palm of each one. Protruding out were at least twenty five fingers, each ending with a bone jutting out, sharpened to an infinitely fine shank tip. \n\nI just stood and stared. You can‚Äôt outrun the Tsunami. You can just sit back and enjoy the last moments in the sun.\n\nThey came in screaming, each clutching the same odd knife. A sea of men in black hoodies, black pants, and white gloves. \n\nEvery swing was batted away as the creature moved with impossible dexterity. It ripped a man‚Äôs head off and ate it with a single crunch. A swipe of one hand disemboweled another. Two hands smashed a chest, turned the man's body gelatinous. One by one, the small army was eviscerated in ever escalating displays of grotesque violence. \n\nI was frozen. The‚Ä¶thing began what I suppose was a laugh midway through the maelstrom. \n\nWith that voice that felt like a kidney stone zig zagging through my body echoing, ‚ÄúYOU DID THIS YOU DID THIS YOU DID THIS‚Äù gleefully as it turned burly men into viscera with ease.\n\nNo knife came even close to striking what was Sally, and the ground was littered with them, along with every organ imaginable. \n\nI picked a dagger up. Not to test my abilities against whatever the fuck this nightmare was but to just cut my throat. \n\nI felt a hand, strong but human, stop me and pull me away, and we were running, the sounds of ghoulish laughter and human skin being ripped off not far behind us. \n\nAfter what felt like miles, we hid in an alley.\n\nThe man took off his hoodie and I finally got a glimpse of him. \n\nIt was the attacker, the one I stopped. \n\nHis eyes looked badly damaged; his nose was still askew. I had done a number on him. \n\nIt dawned on me then that might have only been because he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me.\n\n‚ÄúWhat have I done?‚Äù\n\nMy whisper held more emotion than I‚Äôd expressed in the better part of a year. \n\n‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt know.‚Äù \n\nHis accent was African, though in my ignorance, I could not place it. \n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶what the fuck is she?‚Äù\n\nThe man steeled his gaze.\n\n‚ÄúThat is no ‚Äòshe.‚Äô That is not even an ‚Äòit.‚Äô We have a word for them, but there‚Äôs no real translation to English. The closest thing is ‚ÄúDecayed Whore.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúD‚Ä¶decayed whore?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBefore white men, before Christ, there was a small village in what is today Uganda. What the villagers thought was simply a man, a traveler, passed through the village. \n\nWhen he asked for water, he was given water. When he asked for food, he was given food. \n\nWhen he asked for souls, the villagers chased him far off, into the night. All he did is laugh as he ran. \n\nThen came the decay. \n\nThe rains never came. Crops withered away and died. Any trace of game to hunt disappeared entirely. Sickness never seen before stole the life from children. Every night, booming laughter could be heard echoing in the sky. The minds of the villagers began to twist and knot. \n\nFinally, the man who was not a man passed back through when the remaining villagers were summoning their strength to try and migrate somewhere where life persisted, where hope still lay.\n\nHe said would never let them leave. But they had a choice. \n\nDie horrible deaths or give him the souls he asked for. \n\nMany villagers, women and children among them, died trying to kill him. This man that was not a man. This wandering demon of the ancient world. Those who refused him, he let live to rot away. \n\nThey and the others died heroes.\n\nEleven villagers did not. \n\nThey agreed. Gave up. Surrendered their souls. \n\nHe chained their bodies together, dragged them into the mountains. No one knows what he did with them. But by the time he finished his dark works, they had turned into monsters. \n\nThe demon added insult to injury, bastardizing the sacred, peaceful form of the gorilla into something only pure evil could imagine, let alone wrought.\n\nThose amongst us that hunt the eleven are the descendants of those who found the villagers who lived before they died horrible, agonizing, and slow deaths. \n\nWhen our ancestors went to dig graves for these pour souls, they found buried in each hole the same dagger. Put there by some spirit of the earth or heavens, we assume. A chance to rid the world of what should never have been. \n\nIt‚Äôs our duty to destroy these abominations. We have hunted them for thousands of years. We‚Äôve learned subtle clues that help us track them.\n\nI am called Adroa. You, I believe, are Pappy.‚Äù\n\nTears streamed down my eyes. \n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we‚Ä¶can‚Äôt we find her when she turns back into Sally? Kill her then?‚Äù\n\nAdroa sighed wearily.\n\n‚ÄúThere is no Sally. The Decayed Whores can take on the form of anyone. It changed into that form just to mock me as I missed swipe and after swipe. It was just playing with its food. I thought I had surprised it, just this once, in time to kill it. \n\nThe real problem is, they like to take up roost. Unadulterated violence and stark terror have become boring to them. They like to establish a hunting ground, pick through a population, drive up panic. It‚Äôs a game to them. Subtlety that creates fear they can smell, laugh about, marinade in. Then they corner their prey and quench their bloodlust.\n\nBut it will eat up all the organs and lick up all the blood of tonight and tomorrow, it will move out of its form and walk among those students, playing its sick game. More will go missing. Ripped apart. Eaten.‚Äù\n\nAdroa looked completely defeated, but a single glance in his eyes told me he‚Äôd never give up. He‚Äôd die upon his sword. Or, dagger, as it may be.\n\n‚ÄúAdroa. You said there were eleven Decayed Whores in the beginning that came down from the mountains. [How‚Ä¶how many have your people killed?‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wtfxj2/clinical_trial_87_part_1/)\n\nHis head dropped in his hands, a dagger listlessly hanging at his side.\n\n[‚ÄúNone.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ws2br2/no/)",

    "body": "Hey-Oh! So, I see some form of this question multiple times per day in various skin and personal care subs: How do I deal with my hyperpigmentation? I also asked myself this question a few years ago. See, I'm prone to freckles and a little melasma and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern, especially among people in their 30s. This started as a small post about my routine and ballooned into a massive book about hyperpigmentation. I hope it's helpful!\n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* I use the term \"brightening\" instead of \"lightening\" which is a subtle distinction. None of the ingredients or methods I recommend bleach your skin as \"lightening\" would suggest, but they can reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. \"Brightening\" tends to be a confusing term in skincare, but for the purposes of this post, I use it as a descriptor for anything that helps prevent or reduce melanin in hyperpigmented skin.\n* I will use the term \"hyperpigmentation\" ad nauseam as a catch-all term for excess pigmentation in the skin including freckles, melasma, PIH and dark spots. This does not encompass moles which are different. This is also different from redness, which is a whole other post.\n* Speaking about hyperpigmentation requires some sensitivity to very real issues around it including cultural implications. This post is not intended to moralize hyperpigmentation nor is it intended to alienate the normal melaninization of skin across various tones. Hyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production on the skin in the form of spots that are darker than the surrounding skin. It's not bad or wrong, nor does it speak to anyone not \"doing a good enough job\" of taking care of themselves.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't have any products I've formulated myself to promote. \n\nThis is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:hyperpigmentation. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need:\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Hyperpigmentation\n2. What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n3. How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n4. How to Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n5. Body Hyperpigmentation\n6. Nuclear Options\n\nLet's get to it!\n\n# Types of Hyperpigmentation\n\nHyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production in the skin, but it can actually take a couple different forms. Knowing the type of hyperpigmentation you're experiencing is key to understanding if and how it can be treated.\n\n**Freckles:** Freckles are incredibly common, especially for people with lighter skin tones. They are small, brown or reddish-brown dots often clustered on the skin. They develop on the surface and are not raised bumps. Freckles can appear anywhere on the body but are common on the face. Freckles are permanent, but the color, contrast and severity can vary and be tempered.\n\n**Melasma:** Melasma appears as dark patches or splotches around the face, though usually found on the forehead, upper lip, and high on the cheeks. Melasma forms deeper in the skin and appears more amorphous than freckles, moles, or age spots. It can create a ‚Äúmuddy‚Äù appearance and is very common among pregnant and postpartum women due to hormonal factors. But it can literally happen to anyone and anywhere on the body.\n\n**Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH):** Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) occurs when damaged skin forms melanin during the healing process leaving dark spots. This is common after acne, injuries, eczema, burns, and other trauma to the skin. Exposure to UV rays during healing can make PIH worse. Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) is similar, but leaves pink or red marks on the skin as a result of damage to the capillaries from injury or inflammation. Basically, when skin is compromised by injury, as part of the immune response cells will begin to generate melanin in an attempt to prevent further damage from UV exposure, so what will happen is the wound/legion/blemish will heal but the pigmented skin remains.\n\n**Age Spots:** This is kind of a forgotten form of hyperpigmentation. Sun spots, also referred to as liver spots, and solar lentigines are large spots/patches of dark skin with distinct borders. They vary in color from light brown to almost black. They develop on the surface of the skin usually later in life, but reflect damage that often occurred from improper sun protection at a younger age. They can appear on the face, neck, chest, hands, and arms, usually on areas that had UV exposure. For many people, they can begin to appear in your 30s or 40s.\n\n# What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of hyperpigmentation. Generally, it forms as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Everyone is unique, but these are some of the most common causes of hyperpigmentation and dark spots:\n\n**Genetics** can play a role in the development of hyperpigmentation and dark spots in several ways:\n\n* **Melanin production:** Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount of melanin produced and distributed in the skin is largely determined by genetics. People with a greater genetic predisposition to melanin production in their skin are more likely to experience hyperpigmentation and dark spots as a result of sun exposure, hormonal changes, and other factors. People with darker skin are also more prone to melanin production in the form of hyperpigmentation.\n* **Genetic anomalies:** Certain genetic anomalies, such as oculocutaneous albinism, can affect melanin production and distribution in the skin, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n* **Family history:** If you have a family history of hyperpigmentation or dark spots, you may be more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\n* **Enzymes and genes:** The enzymes that control melanin production and distribution are regulated by specific genes. Variations in these genes can impact melanin production, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n\n**Sun (UV) Exposure.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, UV exposure is the leading environmental cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. It acts as a natural sunscreen (but don't treat it like natural sunscreen!!! This isn't the point of the exercise), absorbing UV radiation to protect the skin from damage.\n\nWhen the skin is exposed to UV radiation, the melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in the skin go into overdrive, producing more melanin to protect the skin from further damage. This increased melanin production can result in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation on the skin.\n\n**Hormones.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, hormones and hormonal sensitivity is a leading internal cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots.\n\nOne of the most well-known examples of hormonal hyperpigmentation is melasma, a condition characterized by dark, amorphous patches on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. Melasma is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, hormonal therapy, or birth control pill use. The hormonal changes can stimulate an increase in melanin production, resulting in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation. This can happen irrespective of UV exposure, though the sun does exacerbate it.\n\nHormones can also affect melanin production by altering the skin's metabolism and pigmentation pathways. For example, high levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands during stress, can trigger an increase in melanin production, resulting in hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Inflammation, Injury & Trauma** to the skin can result in hyperpigmentation by triggering an increase in melanin production. When the skin is inflamed or injured, it triggers a response from the body's immune system, which can stimulate an increase in melanin production as a protective measure.\n\nFor example, acne breakouts or other skin injuries can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which is characterized by dark spots or areas of discoloration on the skin. The dark spots are a result of an increase in melanin production in the affected area, which occurs in response to the inflammation or injury. In addition to acne and other skin injuries, other conditions that can result in PIH include eczema, psoriasis, and insect bites.\n\n**Medication Side Effects.** Certain medications can cause hyperpigmentation on the skin. Medications that can cause hyperpigmentation include:\n\n* **Tetracycline antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline, can cause discoloration of the skin and teeth when taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Chemotherapy drugs:** Certain chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, can cause hyperpigmentation, especially in areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun.\n* **Hormonal medications:** Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills and estrogen replacements, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if they are taken for an extended period of time.\n* **Antimalarial drugs:** Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Isotretinoin** aka accutane when taken for acne can cause hyperpigmentation due to the increase of cell turnover and exposing delicate new skin cells to UV rays before they have shored up.\n\nIf using these medications is necessary for your livelihood, it is not recommended to stop their use without the recommendation of your doctor.\n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n\nWhen looking for skin care products to treat and prevent hyperpigmentation and dark spots, it's important to look for ingredients that can help encourage cell turnover, curb melanin production, and block harmful UV rays. A lot of these things overlap with treatments for other conditions like acne and general anti-aging, but I've noted ones that specifically work on the mechanisms controlling melanin production. Now, this is an extensive list, but I know it doesn't have everything. I've included the ingredients that had the most compelling evidence and/or worked the best for me or people at my practice. But it's also not necessarily a shopping list. You don't have to have all of these things to treat hyperpigmentation, but I'll get to that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets hyperpigmentation based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include:\n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat hyperpigmentation by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help fade dark spots and improve overall skin tone by replacing pigmented skin cells at the surface. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen hyperpigmentation if you're not vigilant about sun protection and avoidance. Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms.\n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. UV exposure is one of the biggest causes of fine hyperpigmentation and wrinkles so adequate protection is essential. I know I'm not winning any science awards for this declaration, but a lot of people who struggle with hyperpigmentation aren't adequately protecting themselves from the sun. But you also have to be kind of realistic. Even with perfect protection and avoidance, sometimes your hyperpigmentation will still flare. This happens during the summer for a lot of people and something even I grapple with. The key is to do your best and SPF actually works well with numerous other ingredients (like the ones listed below) to help solve that problem.\n\n**Arbutin** is a Tyrosinase Inhibitor that blocks melanin production. Arbutin, or the synthesized version called alpha arbutin, is a favorite brightening ingredient because it's a slow-release derivative of hydroquinone that inhibits melanin production. This results in both healing and prevention of dark spots, especially when paired with topical acids. It metabolizes on the skin into hydroquinone which is super effective for hyperpigmentation while being a less controversial and hard-to-come-by ingredient than pure hydroquinone. More on hydroquinone in part 6.\n\n**Tranexamic acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. This was first used in wound care and it was found to have profound effects on hyperpigmentation. Although it's an acid, it's not a chemical exfoliant, kinda like how hyaluronic acid is not a chemical exfoliant. The exact mechanism by which tranexamic acid works to reduce hyperpigmentation is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by reducing inflammation by blocking plasmin which contributes to melanin production when unchecked. It is particularly effective in treating melasma and one of my personal favorite ingredients.\n\n**Kojic Acid** is *another* Tyrosinase Inhibitor. Kojic acid is a natural skin brightener that is derived from various fungi. Kojic acid can also help to exfoliate because it's a slight chemical exfoliant, which can remove dead skin cells that contribute to hyperpigmentation and improve overall appearance. But it does both things: block melanin production and turn skin cells over.\n\n**Azelaic Acid** has a lot of things going for it that can help with hyperpigmentation. It's an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic that disrupts melanin production. Azelaic acid works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin like those other tyrosinase inhibitors. In addition, azelaic acid also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which help to improve the overall health and appearance of the skin by reducing melanin production as a result of injury or inflammation. It's also an anti-acne ingredient that can address the root cause of PIH by reducing acne on the skin. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths.\n\n**Niacinamide** is another one that directly and indirectly addresses hyperpigmentation. It's a skin soother that decreases inflammation and it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne which can curb PIH. It actually took me a little while to figure out that this was another solid hyperpigmentation treatment for these reasons because I used to look at it as being more of an acne treatment. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that works by inhibiting the transfer of pigment within the skin, which can help to reduce the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone. So while it doesn't block tyrosinase, it prevents transfer of pigmented skin cells to the surface.\n\n**Vitamin C aka L-ascorbic acid** is an antioxidant that fights free radical damage. It treats and prevents hyperpigmentation in three ways. First, it reduces free radical damage from UV exposure which helps increase the effectiveness of SPF when worn together. Second, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor that blocks melanin production. And finally, vitamin C encourages skin cell turnover. The key is finding a nice stable version of it.\n\n**Glycolic and Lactic Acid.** Since this list is getting long I am going to group these together. Glycolic Acid is a water-soluble alpha hydroxy acid that penetrates into the pores to treat pigmentation by providing general exfoliation and resurfacing of the skin. The result is improvements in dark spots, texture and other signs of aging. Lactic Acid is also an AHA but with a slightly larger molecular size than glycolic acid so it doesn't penetrate as deep and acts more as a surface exfoliant. As a result it provides more gentle exfoliation to buff away surface pigmentation with an added benefit of acting as a humectant to seal moisture into the skin.\n\n**Licorice Extract** is a plant extract that inhibits melanin production. Licorice root extract contains a compound called glabridin, which has been shown to have skin brightening effects as, you guessed it, a tyrosinase inhibitor. In addition, licorice root extract also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and inflammation associated with hyperpigmentation. I'm seeing more and more of this pop up in skin care.\n\n**Soy Proteins** are another plant extract that inhibits melanin production. They contain compounds known as isoflavones, which have been shown to help reduce the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the skin. Additionally, soy proteins have antioxidant properties that can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation.\n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n\nThis is adapted from numerous comments, posts and DMs I've written on the topic and also comprises a large portion of my own personal routine and routines we recommend to patients. This is a generalist routine meaning it targets all the forms of hyperpigmentation I've mentioned; freckles, melasma, PIH, and age spots though it can be tweaked to address these individually more specifically. This is really my jumping off point for people to get a good idea of what they can achieve as a baseline with OTC ingredients before fine tuning or enlisting the help of a dermatologist. For a lot of people, this is enough to fully resolve, but even if it gets you part of the way there, this should give you a good idea of reactivity.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n* Freckles cannot ever be 100% eradicated. You can however reduce their appearance and prevent them from getting darker. It's important to have realistic goals and understand that sometimes our genetics will overrule any routine we have.\n* This routine and any hyperpigmentation routine will not address moles. Moles are a totally different thing that can only be eradicated through removal by a medical practitioner. Moles can be raised or not, but no amount of topicals will get rid of them.\n* Melasma is a beast. Sometimes it can be treated with OTC topicals, sometimes it requires prescription strength topicals like hydroquinone, sometimes you need in-office procedures like fractal lasers or IPL. Again, this routine is a jumping off point to see what you can accomplish at home before going down that road (and more on that at the bottom in part 6).\n* You'll notice I don't mention products with all the ingredients I listed above. This is because the more you put on your face, the greater your risk of causing irritation. Again, you can adjust and tweak by switching out products with these ingredients or add/subtract as it suits your personal needs.\n* If you're struggling with hyperpigmentation while pregnant or breastfeeding, these recommendations may need to be paused.\n\nAlright, let's get to it!\n\n**AM routine -- The Goal: Heal, Protect, and Prevent. In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n* Azelaic acid\n* Alpha Arbutin\n* Vitamin C serum\n* Moisturizer\n* SPF\n\nThe combo of C+AZ+AA+SPF is an absolute powerhouse for healing existing hyperpigmentation and preventing new hyperpigmentation from forming. It makes your SPF more effective, it inhibits the production of melanin from UV exposure (not your natural melanin production though), and it speeds cell turnover with dual antioxidant action and gentle chemical exfoliation. The result is brighter skin in a few months of consistent use.\n\n**For Azelaic Acid**, this is the ingredient for serious treatment. It's considered one of the most effective ways to reverse melasma aka serious hyperpigmentation short of hydroquinone -- which is both controversial and hard to get. It brings a little bit of exfoliation to the table in addition to inhibiting UV melanin production, but it also has a slight antiseptic property which can help with acne. Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. I get about 6 months out of a tube and a little bit goes a long way.\n\n**For Alpha Arbutin**, the Ordinary's formulation is pretty solid. I prefer the Ordinary's AA 2% + HA as opposed to their AA 2% + Ascorbic Acid 8% as I don't believe the quality and stability of their Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is great. That's why I opt for a separate Vitamin C serum step. But the AA + HA also has a little bit of lactic acid in it which provides some gentle exfoliation and encourages AA deeper into the skin where it's more effective. Lactic acid is mild enough that it's safe for use in a morning routine, but you still want to protect with SPF. There are a couple AA products floating around but I think TO's product is probably the best, most straightforward one. Alpha Arbutin metabolizes into hydroquinone on the skin so is basically one of the best OTC pigment correctors you can get.\n\n**For Vitamin C,** the gold standard really is Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. This is stupid expensive though so I‚Äôm going to suggest Timeless Vitamin C. I like that it comes in an airless pump that prevents oxidation over time. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that increases the rate of skin cell turnover bringing forward new, skin cells while simultaneously improving the effects of SPF. It's a great foundation for a fix.\n\nThese ingredients can be layered on one right after the other then topped with your **moisturizer** (I like a basic one like cetaphil daily lotion), then topped with your **SPF**. The SPF I would recommend is Canmake UV mermaid gel in clear as this will not leave a white cast on your skin and it‚Äôs generally a very elegant SPF. It's SPF 50 which means it gives really good protection, but there are numerous SPFs you can try. I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Biore Aqua Rich (another Japanese brand), Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD.\n\nOf all the products I‚Äôve tried that could act as a stand-in for vitamin c, azelaic acid, and alpha arbutin, there‚Äôs one Japanese serum from Hada Labo called ‚Äúwhitening lotion‚Äù which has had the biggest impact on my hyperpigmentation in a single product of anything I‚Äôve tried. This might be a little too effective though, I actually find that it washed me out within the first 2 weeks of twice daily use, so now I only use it in the morning. And I‚Äôm not a fan of the translation‚Ä¶ which is a direct but mistranslation. It‚Äôs not a bleaching lotion, it also relies on a form of vitamin C and tranexamic acid to brighten skin. But it's a really interesting to try if you wanted a simplified morning routine in which case I would apply this, then your moisturizer, then your SPF.\n\n**PM routine -- The Goal: Renew and Reveal. In order of application:**\n\n* Cleanse\n* Buffer\n* Tranexamic acid and exfoliant OR retinoid\\*\\*\n* Moisturize\n\n**To cleanse**, I have a really basic recommendation that will remove your SPF, makeup, and any grime/sebum from your day. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. Then apply a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser which foams. This will sweep away anything that‚Äôs left and give you a good foundation for the rest of your routine. While this doesn't directly help hyperpigmentation specifically, it's a critical step especially for people who are acne>PIH prone. It also gives you a nice clean slate to apply the rest of your skincare. I've tried dozens of cleansers but always come back to these two as good basic options.\n\n**For your Buffer** this is an important step that can be done prior to using a chemical exfoliant or retinoid: applying an occlusive that will block the active from more sensitive skin. I recommend buffering around your eyes and nostrils with La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm because it kind of doubles as a nice eye cream, but this can also be done with basic vaseline or aquaphor for a more budget-friendly option.\n\n**For Tranexamic Acid**, my holy grail TXA product, La Roche Posay Glycolic B5 is actually a multipurpose serum that combines ingredients to treat hyperpigmentation with chemical exfoliants. It contains two hyperpigmentation heavy hitters -- Tranexamic acid and Kojic Acid which are great for melasma -- and two exfoliants -- Glycolic Acid and Lipo-Hydroxy Acid (LHA) which is like fancy salicylic acid -- so it both reveals new skin cells that are less prone to pigmenting from UV exposure while sloughing away your old skin cells. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize.\n\n**For a Retinoid** if you can get prescription tretinoin, this is going to be the best bet. Your doctor will advise you on the concentration. More on that in part 6. It will help speed up the rate of cell turnover bringing new, unpigmented skin cells to the surface faster. Some other OTC options include differin (which is rated more for acne but uses the same mechanism for cell turnover so it's also effective in this use case) and retinols. Now, I haven't tried every retinol on the market but I have two that I stand by: SkinCeuticals retinol and L'Oreal retinol serum. The SkinCeuticals is, in my opinion, the closest to RX tretinoin in terms of efficacy, but it's a little pricey. The L'Oreal also does a really good job and is a little more affordable. It's currently my go-to OTC on the days I'm not using my RX retinoid tazarotene. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize.\n\n**\\*\\* My recommendations for tranexamic acid and retinoids CANNOT be used in the same night.** You'll nuke your skin. And for most people, both aren't necessary, you can get away with using one or the other. If I had a preference, I would say use the TXA serum instead of a retinoid, but if you can build up a tolerance to using them both without damaging your barrier, they work really well together. So, proceed with caution. If you want to use both, use them on alternate nights and give yourself a night or two without either to let your skin recover. For me personally, I do retinoids on Sundays, and Wednesdays, chemical exfoliants on Mondays and Thursdays, and I let my skin rest (cleanse, moisturize, squalene oil) on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.\n\nOn top of whichever active you choose, apply your moisturizer. You can use the same one you use in your morning routine, the Cetaphil daily lotion as it‚Äôs nice and light. I also like La Roche Posay Toleraine double repair for a ceramide-based cream alternative if you want something richer. You do not want to \"slug\" over actives. This advice gets mixed in a lot. Slugging refers to applying an occlusive layer over your skincare such as vaseline, aquaphor, oils like squalene oil, or healing balms like La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm. While this can be done on hydration nights, it should not be done on nights when you're using chemical exfoliants or retinoids as this may make them too effective causing irritation and breakouts.\n\n# Body Hyperpigmentation\n\nOk, I need everyone to be a grownup for two seconds. These products and methods (both from the prior section and this section) should NOT be used on your genitals. First, you can cause serious irritation or infection by applying active skincare to your genitals. Second, it's really not going to do anything to change the pigmentation of the skin there. The skin on your genitals is different than your body and facial skin and it pigments in different ways for different reasons so it's not going to respond to topicals the same way the rest of your body does. Don't even try it.\n\n**To be perfectly clear, these are the areas you should not be applying skincare:** labia majora, labia minora, vaginal entrance or vagina, clitoral hood, perineum, anus, intergluteal cleft aka inside your butt crack, penis, or scrotum. And I say this as someone who chaffed the precipice of her \"intergluteal cleft\" in an unfortunate crunches-in-the-wrong-gym-shorts accident leaving me with some deeply incriminating hyperpigmentation and earning me the nickname \"skid mark\" from my ever loving boyfriend. It faded after a year but you can still send prayers.\n\n**These are areas you can apply skincare but do so with absolute caution and at your own risk:** bikini line, mons pubis, inner thigh up to the groin fold, butt cheeks.\n\nOk, now that we've got the disclaimers out of the way, let's move forward. Hyperpigmentation can also occur on body skin for the same reason it appears on the face, but it can also be triggered by friction. And because body skin is different from facial skin, it requires a slightly different approach. This is my recommendation for both hyperpigmentation and KP (Keratosis pilaris) because they rely on the same mechanism for treatment: chemical exfoliation.\n\nIn the case of body hyperpigmentation, I recommend a two prong approach: a body wash in the shower and a topical treatment to be used after. Oh, and SPF again if there are areas that are exposed to the sun, and I have a holy grail SPF recommendation for this.\n\nNow you may have noticed in my facial skin recommendation that I did not mention CeraVe as a treatment brand. I have posted numerous takedowns of CeraVe on other threads so I won't rehash them here suffice it to say that it's no longer a brand I can in good faith recommend since it's acquisition by L'Oreal. This is often the brand that's considered when treating KP on the body, but I don't believe their formulations and ingredient quality works for everyone.\n\n**For the body wash**, I recommend Neutrogena body clear with Salicylic acid. This is an exfoliating body wash that will help clear away dead skin cells on the surface allowing new ones to come through. To be effective, you want it to sit on your skin for a little while. I recommend lathering it up and applying it after turning off your shower faucet and letting it sit for 2 or 3 minutes. This is when I like to knock out shower emails. Then rinse away.\n\n**On towel dried skin after your shower**, apply AmLactin Bumps Be Gone. Again, this is formulated for KP but the reason I like it is because it contains lactic acid which will also give the assist on brightening hyperpigmented body skin. The wash and this should be effective, but you might also want to mix in a few drops of the alpha arbutin serum I recommended for your facial routine, maybe three drops per application area (each leg, each arm, chest, etc). I generally don't encourage facial products on the body because it's not an economical use for them, and also because body skin is a little more resilient and doesn't need skincare that's formulated for more sensitive facial skin. The AA serum from the Ordinary is very affordable however and is a good hyperpigmentation generalist.\n\nAnother one that I mentioned in the facial hyperpigmentation portion that can work well on the body is the Hada Labo whitening lotion. Again, this is formulated around tranexamic acid which is very effective for hyperpigmentation and a little bit if this stuff goes a long way. I buy it in bulk from Japanese Importers though it's also available on Amazon for a slightly higher price. If you find yourself in Asia, stock up on it. I use this specifically for fading tan lines that happen (even with diligent/neurotic SPF use) around my fitness watch and the straps of my workout tops that I run in.\n\n**You also want to wear SPF on areas that are exposed to the sun** to prevent pigmentation from occurring. The one I absolutely love that‚Äôs not your 90‚Äôs banana boat is Aveeno Protect + Hydrate lotion with SPF 60. This is a great SPF for a lot of reasons: it finishes like a lotion instead of a sunscreen, it dries down totally clear, and it has a pleasant, slight sweet scent. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being bare skin, 10 being banana boat slathered on by your mom in 1997, and regular body lotion being a 2, I give Aveeno Protect + Hydrate a 2.5 in terms of texture and feel-finish. I use it as my daily lotion on my neck, arms, shoulders, and chest. If you're more active you might need a heavier hitter here like a sport sunscreen.\n\n# Nuclear Options\n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the in-office procedure route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office procedures and RX treatments easier and more effective. Part of it is so you have a good maintenance routine in place to use after the fact to preserve the results of your in-office procedure which can sometimes be costly. Lastly, while some procedures can solve the immediate problem completely, topical skincare can be really effective at treating other adjacent conditions like redness, acne, and fine lines.\n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues like acne and hyperpigmentation. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat hyperpigmentation such as melasma, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting procedures and topicals that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options.\n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done by dermatologists. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or phenol peels may be done for cases of severe hyperpigmentation, but high concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used. I do these twice a year. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup.\n\n\\*\\*\\*IPL Therapy and Laser Therapy may not work for everyone and in some cases may exacerbate hyperpigmentation so you really want to work with dermatologists with a lot of experience in treating cases similar to yours to determine if these interventions are appropriate for you.\n\n**IPL Treatment:** Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy can treat hyperpigmentation by targeting the melanin in the skin with a broad spectrum of light wavelengths, heating and breaking the melanin down. IPL is particularly effective for treating sun damage and age spots, as well as other forms of hyperpigmentation. The treatment is relatively non-invasive, with minimal downtime, making it a popular option. This is also a great treatment for the redness associated with enlarged blood vessels (often confused for broken capillaries) on the surface of the skin which can also appear alongside hyperpigmentation. There isn't any clinical evidence to support at-home IPL devices being effective in the same way. That doesn't mean it's not possible, it's just not studied enough to be certain. Most at-home IPL devices do not operate in effective wavelengths the way professional grade ones do.\n\n**Laser Therapy:** Fractional and CO2 lasers can be used to treat a range of hyperpigmentation issues, including sun damage, age spots, and melasma. The treatment works by removing the top layers of skin, which contain the excess pigmentation, revealing fresh, healthy skin cells underneath. The lasers also stimulate the production of collagen, which helps to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n**Hydroquinone:** This isn't an in-office procedure like the aforementioned treatments, but it is firewalled behind a prescription meaning you can only access hydroquinone in effective concentrations by working with a doctor. This is a somewhat new development at least in the US following some covid-era rejiggering of prescription clearances. HDQ is controversial because it's a skin bleaching agent which has some cultural implications in places where light skin is favored over natural pigmentation. HDQ technically works the same way other OTC tyrosinase inhibitors do (in fact arbutin actually metabolizes into HDQ when applied to the skin), pure HDQ happens to be the most powerful version of them. It lightens any skin it touches, not just hyperpigmented skin in higher concentrations which can make it tough to use. This effect isn't as profound in the other tyrosinase inhibitors I mentioned making them much easier to use over HDQ which, in high concentrations, must be dotted on the skin in only hyperpigmented areas. So HDQ is really reserved for intervention in extreme or OTC treatment-resistance cases.\n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. I mentioned retinoids in the routine so if you're able to get your hands on a prescription from a doctor, it may be more effective than OTC retinols. Most doctors will prescribe a retinoid over hydroquinone, so this is usually easier to procure and can be quite effective on its own as a hyperpigmentation treatment. OTC differin is the only retinoid available over-the-counter (in the US) which can also be used for hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, or as an acne treatment because of its antiseptic properties, but it can also be an effective hyperpigmentation treatment for its tyrosinase-inhibiting ability.\n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

    "body": "Hey-Oh! So, I see some form of this question multiple times per day in various skin and personal care subs: How do I deal with my hyperpigmentation? I also asked myself this question a few years ago. See, I'm prone to freckles and a little melasma and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern, especially among people in their 30s. This started as a small post about my routine and ballooned into a massive book about hyperpigmentation. I hope it's helpful! \n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* I use the term \"brightening\" instead of \"lightening\" which is a subtle distinction. None of the ingredients or methods I recommend bleach your skin as \"lightening\" would suggest, but they can reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. \"Brightening\" tends to be a confusing term in skincare, but for the purposes of this post, I use it as a descriptor for anything that helps prevent or reduce melanin in hyperpigmented skin.\n* I will use the term \"hyperpigmentation\" ad nauseam as a catch-all term for excess pigmentation in the skin including freckles, melasma, PIH and dark spots. This does not encompass moles which are different. This is also different from redness, which is a whole other post.\n* Speaking about hyperpigmentation requires some sensitivity to very real issues around it including cultural implications. This post is not intended to moralize hyperpigmentation nor is it intended to alienate the normal melaninization of skin across various tones. Hyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production on the skin in the form of spots that are darker than the surrounding skin. It's not bad or wrong, nor does it speak to anyone not \"doing a good enough job\" of taking care of themselves.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't have any products I've formulated myself to promote. This is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:hyperpigmentation. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need: \n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Hyperpigmentation\n2. What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n3. How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n4. How to Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n5. Body Hyperpigmentation\n6. Nuclear Options \n\nLet's get to it! \n\n**Types of Hyperpigmentation** \n\nHyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production in the skin, but it can actually take a couple different forms. Knowing the type of hyperpigmentation you're experiencing is key to understanding if and how it can be treated. \n\n**Freckles**:¬†Freckles are incredibly common, especially for people with lighter skin tones. They are small, brown or reddish-brown dots often clustered on the skin. They develop on the surface and are not raised bumps. Freckles can appear anywhere on the body but are common on the face. Freckles are permanent, but the color, contrast and severity can vary and be tempered. \n\n**Melasma**:¬†Melasma appears as dark patches or splotches around the face, though usually found on the forehead, upper lip, and high on the cheeks. Melasma forms deeper in the skin and appears more amorphous than freckles, moles, or age spots. It can create a ‚Äúmuddy‚Äù appearance and is very common among pregnant and postpartum women due to hormonal factors. But it can literally happen to anyone and anywhere on the body. \n\n**Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH)**:¬†Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) occurs when damaged skin forms melanin during the healing process leaving dark spots. This is common after acne, injuries, eczema, burns, and other trauma to the skin. Exposure to UV rays during healing can make PIH worse. Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) is similar, but leaves pink or red marks on the skin as a result of damage to the capillaries from injury or inflammation. Basically, when skin is compromised by injury, as part of the immune response cells will begin to generate melanin in an attempt to prevent further damage from UV exposure, so what will happen is the wound/legion/blemish will heal but the pigmented skin remains. \n\n**Age Spots**:¬†This is kind of a forgotten form of hyperpigmentation. Sun spots, also referred to as liver spots, and solar lentigines are large spots/patches of dark skin with distinct borders. They vary in color from light brown to almost black. They develop on the surface of the skin usually later in life, but reflect damage that often occurred from improper sun protection at a younger age. They can appear on the face, neck, chest, hands, and arms, usually on areas that had UV exposure. For many people, they can begin to appear in your 30s or 40s. \n\n# What Causes Hyperpigmentation? \n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of hyperpigmentation. Generally, it forms as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Everyone is unique, but these are some of the most common causes of hyperpigmentation and dark spots: \n\n**Genetics**¬†can play a role in the development of hyperpigmentation and dark spots in several ways:\n\n* **Melanin production:**¬†Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount of melanin produced and distributed in the skin is largely determined by genetics. People with a greater genetic predisposition to melanin production in their skin are more likely to experience hyperpigmentation and dark spots as a result of sun exposure, hormonal changes, and other factors. People with darker skin are also more prone to melanin production in the form of hyperpigmentation.\n* **Genetic anomalies**:¬†Certain genetic anomalies, such as oculocutaneous albinism, can affect melanin production and distribution in the skin, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n* **Family history:**¬†If you have a family history of hyperpigmentation or dark spots, you may be more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\n* **Enzymes and genes**:¬†The enzymes that control melanin production and distribution are regulated by specific genes. Variations in these genes can impact melanin production, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots. \n\n**Sun (UV) Exposure.**¬†In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, UV exposure is the leading environmental cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. It acts as a natural sunscreen (but don't treat it like natural sunscreen!!! This isn't the point of the exercise), absorbing UV radiation to protect the skin from damage. \n\nWhen the skin is exposed to UV radiation, the melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in the skin go into overdrive, producing more melanin to protect the skin from further damage. This increased melanin production can result in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation on the skin. \n\n**Hormones**.¬†In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, hormones and hormonal sensitivity is a leading internal cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. One of the most well-known examples of hormonal hyperpigmentation is melasma, a condition characterized by dark, amorphous patches on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. Melasma is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, hormonal therapy, or birth control pill use. The hormonal changes can stimulate an increase in melanin production, resulting in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation. This can happen irrespective of UV exposure, though the sun does exacerbate it. \n\nHormones can also affect melanin production by altering the skin's metabolism and pigmentation pathways. For example, high levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands during stress, can trigger an increase in melanin production, resulting in hyperpigmentation. \n\n**Inflammation, Injury & Trauma**¬†to the skin can result in hyperpigmentation by triggering an increase in melanin production. When the skin is inflamed or injured, it triggers a response from the body's immune system, which can stimulate an increase in melanin production as a protective measure. For example, acne breakouts or other skin injuries can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which is characterized by dark spots or areas of discoloration on the skin. The dark spots are a result of an increase in melanin production in the affected area, which occurs in response to the inflammation or injury. In addition to acne and other skin injuries, other conditions that can result in PIH include eczema, psoriasis, and insect bites. \n\n**Medication Side Effects.**¬†Certain medications can cause hyperpigmentation on the skin. Medications that can cause hyperpigmentation include:\n\n* **Tetracycline antibiotics:**¬†Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline, can cause discoloration of the skin and teeth when taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):**¬†NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Chemotherapy drugs:**¬†Certain chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, can cause hyperpigmentation, especially in areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun.\n* **Hormonal medications:**¬†Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills and estrogen replacements, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if they are taken for an extended period of time.\n* **Antimalarial drugs:**¬†Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Isotretinoin**¬†aka accutane when taken for acne can cause hyperpigmentation due to the increase of cell turnover and exposing delicate new skin cells to UV rays before they have shored up. \n\nIf using these medications is necessary for your livelihood, it is not recommended to stop their use without the recommendation of your doctor. \n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients \n\nWhen looking for skin care products to treat and prevent hyperpigmentation and dark spots, it's important to look for ingredients that can help encourage cell turnover, curb melanin production, and block harmful UV rays. A lot of these things overlap with treatments for other conditions like acne and general anti-aging, but I've noted ones that specifically work on the mechanisms controlling melanin production. Now, this is an extensive list, but I know it doesn't have everything. I've included the ingredients that had the most compelling evidence and/or worked the best for me or people at my practice. But it's also not necessarily a shopping list. You don't have to have all of these things to treat hyperpigmentation, but I'll get to that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets hyperpigmentation based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include: \n\n**Retinoids**¬†that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat hyperpigmentation by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help fade dark spots and improve overall skin tone by replacing pigmented skin cells at the surface. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen hyperpigmentation if you're not vigilant about sun protection and avoidance. Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms. \n\n**SPF**¬†represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. UV exposure is one of the biggest causes of fine hyperpigmentation and wrinkles so adequate protection is essential. I know I'm not winning any science awards for this declaration, but a lot of people who struggle with hyperpigmentation aren't adequately protecting themselves from the sun. But you also have to be kind of realistic. Even with perfect protection and avoidance, sometimes your hyperpigmentation will still flare. This happens during the summer for a lot of people and something even I grapple with. The key is to do your best and SPF actually works well with numerous other ingredients (like the ones listed below) to help solve that problem. Arbutin¬†is a Tyrosinase Inhibitor that blocks melanin production. \n\n**Arbutin**, or the synthesized version called alpha arbutin, is a favorite brightening ingredient because it's a slow-release derivative of hydroquinone that inhibits melanin production. This results in both healing and prevention of dark spots, especially when paired with topical acids. It metabolizes on the skin into hydroquinone which is super effective for hyperpigmentation while being a less controversial and hard-to-come-by ingredient than pure hydroquinone. More on hydroquinone in part 6. \n\n**Tranexamic acid**¬†is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. This was first used in wound care and it was found to have profound effects on hyperpigmentation. Although it's an acid, it's not a chemical exfoliant, kinda like how hyaluronic acid is not a chemical exfoliant. The exact mechanism by which tranexamic acid works to reduce hyperpigmentation is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by reducing inflammation by blocking plasmin which contributes to melanin production when unchecked. It is particularly effective in treating melasma and one of my personal favorite ingredients. \n\n**Kojic Acid**¬†is¬†another¬†Tyrosinase Inhibitor. Kojic acid is a natural skin brightener that is derived from various fungi. Kojic acid can also help to exfoliate because it's a slight chemical exfoliant, which can remove dead skin cells that contribute to hyperpigmentation and improve overall appearance. But it does both things: block melanin production and turn skin cells over. Azelaic Acid¬†has a lot of things going for it that can help with hyperpigmentation. It's an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic that disrupts melanin production. \n\n**Azelaic acid** works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin like those other tyrosinase inhibitors. In addition, azelaic acid also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which help to improve the overall health and appearance of the skin by reducing melanin production as a result of injury or inflammation. It's also an anti-acne ingredient that can address the root cause of PIH by reducing acne on the skin. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths. \n\n**Niacinamide**¬†is another one that directly and indirectly addresses hyperpigmentation. It's a skin soother that decreases inflammation and it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne which can curb PIH. It actually took me a little while to figure out that this was another solid hyperpigmentation treatment for these reasons because I used to look at it as being more of an acne treatment. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that works by inhibiting the transfer of pigment within the skin, which can help to reduce the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone. So while it doesn't block tyrosinase, it prevents transfer of pigmented skin cells to the surface. \n\n**Vitamin C aka L-ascorbic acid**¬†is an antioxidant that fights free radical damage. It treats and prevents hyperpigmentation in three ways. First, it reduces free radical damage from UV exposure which helps increase the effectiveness of SPF when worn together. Second, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor that blocks melanin production. And finally, vitamin C encourages skin cell turnover. The key is finding a nice stable version of it. \n\n**Glycolic and Lactic Acid.**¬†Since this list is getting long I am going to group these together. Glycolic Acid is a water-soluble alpha hydroxy acid that penetrates into the pores to treat pigmentation by providing general exfoliation and resurfacing of the skin. The result is improvements in dark spots, texture and other signs of aging. Lactic Acid is also an AHA but with a slightly larger molecular size than glycolic acid so it doesn't penetrate as deep and acts more as a surface exfoliant. As a result it provides more gentle exfoliation to buff away surface pigmentation with an added benefit of acting as a humectant to seal moisture into the skin. Licorice Extract¬†is a plant extract that inhibits melanin production. \n\n**Licorice root extract** contains a compound called glabridin, which has been shown to have skin brightening effects as, you guessed it, a tyrosinase inhibitor. In addition, licorice root extract also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and inflammation associated with hyperpigmentation. I'm seeing more and more of this pop up in skin care. \n\n**Soy Proteins**¬†are another plant extract that inhibits melanin production. They contain compounds known as isoflavones, which have been shown to help reduce the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the skin. Additionally, soy proteins have antioxidant properties that can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation. \n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations \n\nThis is adapted from numerous comments, posts and DMs I've written on the topic and also comprises a large portion of my own personal routine and routines we recommend to patients. This is a generalist routine meaning it targets all the forms of hyperpigmentation I've mentioned; freckles, melasma, PIH, and age spots though it can be tweaked to address these individually more specifically. This is really my jumping off point for people to get a good idea of what they can achieve as a baseline with OTC ingredients before fine tuning or enlisting the help of a dermatologist. For a lot of people, this is enough to fully resolve, but even if it gets you part of the way there, this should give you a good idea of reactivity. A few caveats:\n\n* Freckles cannot ever be 100% eradicated. You can however reduce their appearance and prevent them from getting darker. It's important to have realistic goals and understand that sometimes our genetics will overrule any routine we have.\n* This routine and any hyperpigmentation routine will not address moles. Moles are a totally different thing that can only be eradicated through removal by a medical practitioner. Moles can be raised or not, but no amount of topicals will get rid of them.\n* Melasma is a beast. Sometimes it can be treated with OTC topicals, sometimes it requires prescription strength topicals like hydroquinone, sometimes you need in-office procedures like fractal lasers or IPL. Again, this routine is a jumping off point to see what you can accomplish at home before going down that road.\n* You'll notice I don't mention products with all the ingredients I listed above. This is because the more you put on your face, the greater your risk of causing irritation. Again, you can adjust and tweak by switching out products with these ingredients or add/subtract as it suits your personal needs.\n* If you're struggling with hyperpigmentation while pregnant or breastfeeding, these recommendations may need to be paused. \n\nAlright, let's get to it! \n\n**AM routine -- The Goal: Heal, Protect, and Prevent. In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n* Azelaic acid\n* Alpha Arbutin\n* Vitamin C serum\n* Moisturizer\n* SPF \n\nThe combo of C+AZ+AA+SPF is an absolute powerhouse for healing existing hyperpigmentation and preventing new hyperpigmentation from forming. It makes your SPF more effective, it inhibits the production of melanin from UV exposure (not your natural melanin production though), and it speeds cell turnover with dual antioxidant action and gentle chemical exfoliation. The result is brighter skin in a few months of consistent use. \n\n**For Azelaic Acid**, this is the ingredient for serious treatment. It's considered one of the most effective ways to reverse melasma aka serious hyperpigmentation short of hydroquinone -- which is both controversial and hard to get. It brings a little bit of exfoliation to the table in addition to inhibiting UV melanin production, but it also has a slight antiseptic property which can help with acne. Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. I get about 6 months out of a tube and a little bit goes a long way. \n\n**For Alpha Arbutin**, the Ordinary's formulation is pretty solid. I prefer the Ordinary's AA 2% + HA as opposed to their AA 2% + Ascorbic Acid 8% as I don't believe the quality and stability of their Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is great. That's why I opt for a separate Vitamin C serum step. But the AA + HA also has a little bit of lactic acid in it which provides some gentle exfoliation and encourages AA deeper into the skin where it's more effective. Lactic acid is mild enough that it's safe for use in a morning routine, but you still want to protect with SPF. There are a couple AA products floating around but I think TO's product is probably the best, most straightforward one. Alpha Arbutin metabolizes into hydroquinone on the skin so is basically one of the best OTC pigment correctors you can get. \n\n**For Vitamin C**,¬†the gold standard really is Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. This is stupid expensive though so I‚Äôm going to suggest Timeless Vitamin C. I like that it comes in an airless pump that prevents oxidation over time. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that increases the rate of skin cell turnover bringing forward new, skin cells while simultaneously improving the effects of SPF. It's a great foundation for a fix. \n\nThese ingredients can be layered on one right after the other then topped with your¬†**moisturizer**¬†(I like a basic one like cetaphil daily lotion), then topped with your¬†**SPF**. The SPF I would recommend is Canmake UV mermaid gel in clear as this will not leave a white cast on your skin and it‚Äôs generally a very elegant SPF. It's SPF 50 which means it gives really good protection, but there are numerous SPFs you can try. I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Biore Aqua Rich (another Japanese brand), Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD. \n\nOf all the products I‚Äôve tried that could act as a stand-in for vitamin c, azelaic acid, and alpha arbutin, there‚Äôs one Japanese serum from **Hada Labo called ‚Äúwhitening lotion‚Äù** which has had the biggest impact on my hyperpigmentation in a single product of anything I‚Äôve tried. This might be a little too effective though, I actually find that it washed me out within the first 2 weeks of twice daily use, so now I only use it in the morning. And I‚Äôm not a fan of the translation‚Ä¶ which is a direct but mistranslation. It‚Äôs not a bleaching lotion, it also relies on a form of vitamin C and tranexamic acid to brighten skin. But it's a really interesting to try if you wanted a simplified morning routine in which case I would apply this, then your moisturizer, then your SPF. \n\n**PM routine -- The Goal: Renew and Reveal. In order of application:**\n\n* Cleanse\n* Buffer\n* Tranexamic acid and exfoliant OR retinoid\\*\\*\n* Moisturize \n\n**To cleanse**, I have a really basic recommendation that will remove your SPF, makeup, and any grime/sebum from your day. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. Then apply a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser which foams. This will sweep away anything that‚Äôs left and give you a good foundation for the rest of your routine. While this doesn't directly help hyperpigmentation specifically, it's a critical step especially for people who are acne>PIH prone. It also gives you a nice clean slate to apply the rest of your skincare. I've tried dozens of cleansers but always come back to these two as good basic options. \n\n**For your Buffer**¬†this is an important step that can be done prior to using a chemical exfoliant or retinoid: applying an occlusive that will block the active from more sensitive skin. I recommend buffering around your eyes and nostrils with La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm because it kind of doubles as a nice eye cream, but this can also be done with basic vaseline or aquaphor for a more budget-friendly option. \n\n**For Tranexamic Acid**, my holy grail TXA product, La Roche Posay Glycolic B5 is actually a multipurpose serum that combines ingredients to treat hyperpigmentation with chemical exfoliants. It contains two hyperpigmentation heavy hitters -- Tranexamic acid and Kojic Acid which are great for melasma -- and two exfoliants -- Glycolic Acid and Lipo-Hydroxy Acid (LHA) which is like fancy salicylic acid -- so it both reveals new skin cells that are less prone to pigmenting from UV exposure while sloughing away your old skin cells. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize. \n\n**For a Retinoid**¬†if you can get prescription tretinoin, this is going to be the best bet. Your doctor will advise you on the concentration. More on that in part 6. It will help speed up the rate of cell turnover bringing new, unpigmented skin cells to the surface faster. Some other OTC options include differin (which is rated more for acne but uses the same mechanism for cell turnover so it's also effective in this use case) and retinols. Now, I haven't tried every retinol on the market but I have two that I stand by: SkinCeuticals retinol and L'Oreal retinol serum. The SkinCeuticals is, in my opinion, the closest to RX tretinoin in terms of efficacy, but it's a little pricey. The L'Oreal also does a really good job and is a little more affordable. It's currently my go-to OTC on the days I'm not using my RX retinoid tazarotene. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize. \n\n**\\*\\* My recommendations for tranexamic acid and retinoids CANNOT be used in the same night.**¬†You'll nuke your skin. And for most people, both aren't necessary, you can get away with using one or the other. If I had a preference, I would say use the TXA serum instead of a retinoid, but if you can build up a tolerance to using them both without damaging your barrier, they work really well together. So, proceed with caution. If you want to use both, use them on alternate nights and give yourself a night or two without either to let your skin recover. For me personally, I do retinoids on Sundays, and Wednesdays, chemical exfoliants on Mondays and Thursdays, and I let my skin rest (cleanse, moisturize, squalene oil) on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. \n\nOn top of whichever active you choose, apply your **moisturizer**. You can use the same one you use in your morning routine, the Cetaphil daily lotion as it‚Äôs nice and light. I also like La Roche Posay Toleraine double repair for a ceramide-based cream alternative if you want something richer. \n\nYou do not want to \"slug\" over actives. This advice gets mixed in a lot. Slugging refers to applying an occlusive layer over your skincare such as vaseline, aquaphor, oils like squalene oil, or healing balms like La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm. While this can be done on hydration nights, it should not be done on nights when you're using chemical exfoliants or retinoids as this may make them too effective causing irritation and breakouts. \n\n# Body Hyperpigmentation \n\nOk, I need everyone to be a grownup for two seconds. These products and methods (both from the prior section and this section) should NOT be used on your genitals. First, you can cause serious irritation or infection by applying active skincare to your genitals. Second, it's really not going to do anything to change the pigmentation of the skin there. The skin on your genitals is different than your body and facial skin and it pigments in different ways for different reasons so it's not going to respond to topicals the same way the rest of your body does. Don't even try it. \n\n**To be perfectly clear, these are the areas you should not be applying skincare:**¬†labia majora, labia minora, vaginal entrance or vagina, clitoral hood, perineum, anus, intergluteal cleft aka inside your butt crack, penis, or scrotum. And I say this as someone who chaffed the precipice of her \"intergluteal cleft\" in an unfortunate crunches-in-the-wrong-gym-shorts accident leaving me with some deeply incriminating hyperpigmentation and earning me the nickname \"skid mark\" from my ever loving boyfriend. It faded after a year but you can still send prayers. \n\n**These are areas you can apply skincare but do so with absolute caution and at your own risk**:¬†bikini line, mons pubis, inner thigh up to the groin fold, butt cheeks. Ok, now that we've got the disclaimers out of the way, let's move forward. \n\nHyperpigmentation can also occur on body skin for the same reason it appears on the face, but it can also be triggered by friction. And because body skin is different from facial skin, it requires a slightly different approach. This is my recommendation for both hyperpigmentation and KP (Keratosis pilaris) because they rely on the same mechanism for treatment: chemical exfoliation. \n\nIn the case of body hyperpigmentation, I recommend a two prong approach: a body wash in the shower and a topical treatment to be used after. Oh, and SPF again if there are areas that are exposed to the sun, and I have a holy grail SPF recommendation for this. \n\nNow you may have noticed in my facial skin recommendation that I did not mention CeraVe as a treatment brand. I have posted numerous takedowns of CeraVe on other threads so I won't rehash them here suffice it to say that it's no longer a brand I can in good faith recommend since it's acquisition by L'Oreal. This is often the brand that's considered when treating KP on the body, but I don't believe their formulations and ingredient quality works for everyone. \n\n**For the body wash**, I recommend Neutrogena body clear with Salicylic acid. This is an exfoliating body wash that will help clear away dead skin cells on the surface allowing new ones to come through. To be effective, you want it to sit on your skin for a little while. I recommend lathering it up and applying it after turning off your shower faucet and letting it sit for 2 or 3 minutes. This is when I like to knock out shower emails. Then rinse away. \n\n**On towel dried skin** after your shower, apply AmLactin Bumps Be Gone. Again, this is formulated for KP but the reason I like it is because it contains lactic acid which will also give the assist on brightening hyperpigmented body skin. The wash and this should be effective, but you might also want to mix in a few drops of the alpha arbutin serum I recommended for your facial routine, maybe three drops per application area (each leg, each arm, chest, etc). I generally don't encourage facial products on the body because it's not an economical use for them, and also because body skin is a little more resilient and doesn't need skincare that's formulated for more sensitive facial skin. The AA serum from the Ordinary is very affordable however and is a good hyperpigmentation generalist. \n\nAnother one that I mentioned in the facial hyperpigmentation portion that can work well on the body is the Hada Labo whitening lotion. Again, this is formulated around tranexamic acid which is very effective for hyperpigmentation and a little bit if this stuff goes a long way. I buy it in bulk from Japanese Importers though it's also available on Amazon for a slightly higher price. If you find yourself in Asia, stock up on it. I use this specifically for fading tan lines that happen (even with diligent/neurotic SPF use) around my fitness watch and the straps of my workout tops that I run in. \n\n**You also want to wear SPF on areas that are exposed to the sun**¬†to prevent pigmentation from occurring. The one I absolutely love that‚Äôs not your 90‚Äôs banana boat is Aveeno Protect + Hydrate lotion with SPF 60. This is a great SPF for a lot of reasons: it finishes like a lotion instead of a sunscreen, it dries down totally clear, and it has a pleasant, slight sweet scent. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being bare skin, 10 being banana boat slathered on by your mom in 1997, and regular body lotion being a 2, I give Aveeno Protect + Hydrate a 2.5 in terms of texture and feel-finish. I use it as my daily lotion on my neck, arms, shoulders, and chest. If you're more active you might need a heavier hitter here like a sport sunscreen. \n\n# Nuclear Options \n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the in-office procedure route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office procedures and RX treatments easier and more effective. Part of it is so you have a good maintenance routine in place to use after the fact to preserve the results of your in-office procedure which can sometimes be costly. Lastly, while some procedures can solve the immediate problem completely, topical skincare can be really effective at treating other adjacent conditions like redness, acne, and fine lines. \n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues like acne and hyperpigmentation. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat hyperpigmentation such as melasma, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting procedures and topicals that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options. \n\n**Medical Grade Peels:**¬†Medical grade chemical peels can be done by dermatologists. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or phenol peels may be done for cases of severe hyperpigmentation, but high concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used. I do these twice a year. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup. \n\n\\*\\*\\*IPL Therapy and Laser Therapy may not work for everyone and in some cases may exacerbate hyperpigmentation so you really want to work with dermatologists with a lot of experience in treating cases similar to yours to determine if these interventions are appropriate for you. \n\n**IPL Treatment:**¬†Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy can treat hyperpigmentation by targeting the melanin in the skin with a broad spectrum of light wavelengths, heating and breaking the melanin down. IPL is particularly effective for treating sun damage and age spots, as well as other forms of hyperpigmentation. The treatment is relatively non-invasive, with minimal downtime, making it a popular option. This is also a great treatment for the redness associated with enlarged blood vessels (often confused for broken capillaries) on the surface of the skin which can also appear alongside hyperpigmentation. There isn't any clinical evidence to support at-home IPL devices being effective in the same way. That doesn't mean it's not possible, it's just not studied enough to be certain. Most at-home IPL devices do not operate in effective wavelengths the way professional grade ones do. \n\n**Laser Therapy:**¬†Fractional and CO2 lasers can be used to treat a range of hyperpigmentation issues, including sun damage, age spots, and melasma. The treatment works by removing the top layers of skin, which contain the excess pigmentation, revealing fresh, healthy skin cells underneath. The lasers also stimulate the production of collagen, which helps to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. \n\n**Hydroquinone**:¬†This isn't an in-office procedure like the aforementioned treatments, but it is firewalled behind a prescription meaning you can only access hydroquinone in effective concentrations by working with a doctor. This is a somewhat new development at least in the US following some covid-era rejiggering of prescription clearances. HDQ is controversial because it's a skin bleaching agent which has some cultural implications in places where light skin is favored over natural pigmentation. HDQ technically works the same way other OTC tyrosinase inhibitors do (in fact arbutin actually metabolizes into HDQ when applied to the skin), pure HDQ happens to be the most powerful version of them. It lightens any skin it touches, not just hyperpigmented skin in higher concentrations which can make it tough to use. This effect isn't as profound in the other tyrosinase inhibitors I mentioned making them much easier to use over HDQ which, in high concentrations, must be dotted on the skin in only hyperpigmented areas. So HDQ is really reserved for intervention in extreme or OTC treatment-resistance cases. \n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:**¬†This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. I mentioned retinoids in the routine so if you're able to get your hands on a prescription from a doctor, it may be more effective than OTC retinols. Most doctors will prescribe a retinoid over hydroquinone, so this is usually easier to procure and can be quite effective on its own as a hyperpigmentation treatment. OTC differin is the only retinoid available over-the-counter (in the US) which can also be used for hyperpigmentation. \n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:**¬†This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, or as an acne treatment because of its antiseptic properties, but it can also be an effective hyperpigmentation treatment for its tyrosinase-inhibiting ability. \n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone.

        "body": "Wowwowow insanely comprehensive and great info. Also beautifully presented and well formatted! So glad to see so many great suggestions and some of my favorite combinations too.\n\n  \n\n\nOne thing I wanted to comment on was the part about using tranexamic OR retinoids and how you suggested using them and just further clarify that that's, as you pointed out, something specific to the products you were suggesting in this example because the LRP glycolic b5 obviously has glycolic. So it is very much appreciated that you were attentive enough to point out that using retinoids and glycolic on the same night is a big risk for most people üòá\n\n  \n\n\nSince tranexamic itself isn't going to lead to any additional irritation risk, by itself it's safe to use with whatever else you'd like if the formualtion doesn't contain other actives that would add irritation risk. Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic + niacinamide) is one of the generic options I would suggest that won't be adding additional irritation risk, and can certainly be used with retinoids comfortably. Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic + niacinamide). Some other options with just slight exfoliation power but can be comfortably layered with retinoids without significant tolerance risk is Be Minimalist Tranexamic acid serum has no niacinamide, but has 3% mandelic and 0.3% salicylic, and HPA. Those are my 2 primary reccs. There's also Naturium Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic acid, niacinamide, licorice, kojic acid) which is more impressive on paper but all of them are excellent.\n\n  \n\n\nThe second is the retinoid application method. I always advise using moisturizer BEFORE your retinoid rather than after. Since there's no reduction in efficacy, theres only upside of decelerated absorbtion leading to less oversaturation of the retinoic acid receptors which is what leads to those side effects. (Using moisturizer before retinoids is also referred to as buffering but I don't want to confuse anyone with using the word buffering in 2 different ways here). Ideally in the simplest routine example, you would cleanse, apply the cos de baha tranexamic serum, moisturize on damp skin. then wait for it to dry down and then apply your retinoid.\n\n  \n\n\nI have a whole guide on how to use retinoids optimally and a list of reccs which I think would be great here for some affordable options in varying potency ranges. I particularly suggest one of the RetinAL products for anyone seeking the most potent OTC options aside from Adapelene depending on your country and very affordable!\n\n  \n\n\n> Retinoid reccs and guidance [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/qtodqu/routine_help_how_to_cleanse_once_a_day_when_you/hkp4w8t/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/qtodqu/routine_help_how_to_cleanse_once_a_day_when_you/hkp4w8t/)\n\n  \n\n\nAnd if it interests you, I believe I have a whole different post linked within that specifically dedicated to discussing the cost:benefit analysis of using moisturizer before retinoids or applying it to clean skin instead. (spoiler: there is no benefit to not using moisturizer before, only risk.)\n\n  \n\n\nFor vitamin C, a fav is the Minimalist 10% or 16% vitamin C which uses centella water as a base so you also get some great additional anti-inflammatory benefit to further reduce any potential irritation. I'm not a huge vitamin C fan, it's great if you can tolerate the extra irritation potential and already have many of those other ingredients you mentioned incorporated since azelaic and retinoids and tyrosinase inhibitors are going to be much more hard hitting for hyperpigmentation :) and having anti-inflammatory ingredients included in your routine can make a huge difference for PIE and consequently PIH to prevent the melanocytes from being irritated.\n\n  \n\n\nI also definitely agree with the TO azelaic being very sensorially and cosmetically unpleasant ü§£. It has a hard time not just pulling with ITSELF which is an impressive feat that they managed to botch the formulation so badly.\n\nWhat I normally suggest is one of:\n\n *  Q +A 8%Azelaic Acid serum\n *  Cosde Baha azelaic acid 10% serum (has Niacinamide)\n *  Peach Slices azelaic acid 10% serum\n *  Finacea 15% azelaic acid prescription (preferably the foam if accessible as it's much more comfortable and elegant, but insurance can make that prohibitive for some).\n\nThsts all I have to comment on for now. Your post was excellent and I hope people get to see it!",

It might have been psychological, but I'm convinced that incorporating peels and leave-on exfoliants took my anti-aging game to the next level!\n\nMy go-to peels are MUAC's 40% mandelic acid peel and their 40% glycolic acid peel. I also love Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peels. I typically pair them with a 14% glycolic acid leave-on exfoliant from Alpha Skincare. These exfoliating peels and leave-on serums have increased my anti-aging results tenfold.\n\nTIP:  When shopping for exfoliants, make sure to look for products with a True Acid Value (TAV) label. This ensures you're getting the actual percentage of the acid, rather than just a percentage of the entire formula. For instance, a product claiming 5% lactic acid might only contain 2% of the actual acid. \n\nAs a cosmetics insider, I've got some industry secrets to share. Let's just say I'm not a fan of certain brands (cough, The Ordinary, cough) that don't provide accurate labeling. But that's a topic for another time! Stay exfoliated, stay fabulous!",

    "body": "As some background, my mother was physically and emotionally abusive throughout my childhood. Although she was a stay-at-home-mom, she definitely didn‚Äôt seem to do anything that typical SAHMs do. She hardly ever cleaned the house to the point where a thick layer of dust built up on surfaces that weren‚Äôt used frequently, the shower always had mold and mildew stains, etc. She routinely let me go hungry and used food as a way of controlling me. \n\nTo give you an idea of just how lazy but controlling my mother was: Her legs would ache (I know now that these aches were lactic acid buildup) from the physical exertion of dropping me off at and picking me up from school. Not that she walked the entire way from our house. This was walking to the car, driving to my school, walking to the door and back. She‚Äôd also get these aches going grocery shopping, or anywhere really. Why? Because she sat on the sofa everyday for hours watching soap operas. I think the reason this lack of physical activity didn‚Äôt reflect on her appearance was because she had/has a high metabolism. But she‚Äôd use taking me to school as an excuse to force me to ‚Äúmassage‚Äù her legs for at least an hour every day afterwards. I remember being really small (5-6yo) when this first started, and feeling the weight of her legs on my lap crushing me. She‚Äôd drink a glass of wine while I ‚Äúmassaged‚Äù her, watch TV, and criticize me. If I didn‚Äôt do well enough, she either wouldn‚Äôt feed me dinner or would throw junk food (chips usually) at me. This happened more often than not.\n\nMy father travelled a lot for work. Whenever I tried to tell him about how my mother treated me in his absence, he didn‚Äôt believe me. I don‚Äôt know why exactly, but likely a combo of my mother being an excellent manipulator and simply not caring. After graduating from HS, I packed my bags and never looked back. \n\nI was very lucky to have received scholarships/ fellowships for college and grad school, so I put myself through school without any parental support. I got a well paying job after grad school and bought my first home about a year ago in a HCOL area after years of saving.\n\nDespite having no contact for over a decade, almost 2, my mother called me last week. She‚Äôd found my number through my company‚Äôs website. She thinks it‚Äôs so great that I live in City X now and wants to move in with me. It‚Äôs apparently the least I can do after she and my father raised me. Apparently I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am without them. I‚Äôll admit that I was stunned. I told her that in no uncertain terms would I ever take care of them If she showed up at my door, I‚Äôd call the cops and have them trespassed. \n\nNow my assistant overheard this conversation, but just my side. She was the one who screened the call, so she knew it was my mother. Since then, she‚Äôs told me and anyone who‚Äôd listen that I‚Äôm a bad daughter and treat my family poorly. So I have to know: AITA?",

I've purchased multiple bottles directly from the brand and from drugstores with dependable results. After a year+ of daily use, I feel very familiar with the characteristics of this product - it has a very, very unique texture and smell (that many people are turned off by, but I've grown to love because this stuff is just so damn effective). It's quite runny for a body lotion, and smells strongly sour because of the high concentration of ammonium lactate (so much so that my parter and I jokingly refer to it as \"cheese lotion\").\n\nDespite all the advice against ordering skincare on¬†[Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), I decided to grab a bottle from during black Friday sales. The seller was listed simply as \"amazon.com\" and the product listed had more than 30k reviews. I took the plunge. The first thing that aroused any suspicion upon its arrival was a very crooked sticker-type label. I opened the bottle and the lotion inside was incredibly thick, pasty, with an entirely different texture to every bottle I'd previously purchased. Also, instead of its characteristic sour \"cheese\" smell, this Amazon bottle smelled very plain and siliconey - like exactly the scent of Cerave Moisturizing Cream in the tub.\n\nthis shi\\* isn't cheap, and I'm frustrated that a company as successful and monopolistic as Amazon can sell hazardous counterfeits without any repercussions. There are listed ingredients on the bottle, but the product inside was clearly formulated differently and contains god knows what. \n\n**I'll add my voice to the long list of others who beg PLEASE do not give a cent of your hard-earned money to Amazon if you can help it. Make sure to inform your friends and family so they can also avoid wasted time, funds, and potentially the health of their skin.**\n\n[https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-labeling-regulations/summary-cosmetics-labeling-requirements#Adulterated](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-labeling-regulations/summary-cosmetics-labeling-requirements#Adulterated)",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here‚Äôs a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it‚Äôs in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

    "body": "With ~~Drunk Elephant~~ (whoa little Freudian slip there), er ***Sunday Riley*** recently being [gently scolded by the FTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dl7ca6/miscellaneous_the_ftc_said_sunday_riley_faked/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) for fake reviews on Sephora‚Äôs website, I‚Äôve seen a lot of confusion and doubt about how to actually find legitimate reviews for products online. I consider myself to be a Jedi Knight in the fine art of Googling and whatever the Jedi equivalent of a Black Belt is in cutting through bullshit, and have honed and crafted my vetting process over many moons of‚Ä¶ Googling and cutting through bullshit. Man sometimes a sentence just doesn‚Äôt end with that bang you imagined.\n\nI thought I‚Äôd share my steps here so you can grab and pick out what you will, and hopefully feel a little less overwhelmed by the fact that everything you read is probably a lie!\n\n**Overview** of the steps I'll cover below in far more detail-\n\n1. Look at what it's supposed to do and throw ingredients list into Cosdna\n2. Look only at negative reviews; filter from lowest to highest rated. Ignore 4/5 star reviews\n3. Use Google to search for reviews from many different sources (i.e. Google \"{{Product Name}} Reviews\")\n4. Get sample if possible; Buy smallest size possible\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Phase One: Basic Recon** *Oh that product has piqued my interest! What fine retailers might I purchase it at?*\n\nSometimes I‚Äôll come across a product that has a¬†*je ne sais quoi*¬†about it. Let‚Äôs take a real life example from those naughty little review fakers at Sunday Riley and use their Good Genes as our product to research. Few products have been as mega-hyped as Good Genes because¬†*Oprah*¬†loved it and she‚Äôs still a thing (maybe? Didn't OWN flop?) and it took off from there. So you'd start with knowing a few things about yourself and what you're looking for.\n\n1. Skin Type (I'm Oily-to-normal)\n2. Main Concern you're looking to address with this product (I'm looking to combat acne and large pores + even out my skin tone)\n3. What you're comfortable spending (I'm Mid-range to High-end: Not super concerned about a price tag if it‚Äôs gonna work. But like not Barbara Sturm $300 for freaking Hyaluronic Acid expensive. We'll call that \"stupid expensive\".)\n\nSo let's say I‚Äôm all starry-eyed over Good Genes because I got a little short changed on legit good genes and if¬†*The Secret*¬†taught me anything it‚Äôs that I bring into my life what I desire. I want good genes so maybe this is the Universe being like- ‚ÄúHey, I dropped some shit off at Sephora for you.‚Äù I first will go to the product's page at Sephora and take a look at two things: the product‚Äôs claims and its ingredients.\n\n[Good Gene's Sephora Page](https://www.sephora.com/product/good-genes-all-in-one-lactic-acid-treatment-P309308?skuId=1418581&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939500_pla-419039569134_1418581_257731947995_9029600_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&ds_rl=1261471&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsfGr0eOu5QIVdB-tBh1d3QRzEAQYASABEgJZH_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\nSo for Good Genes we have the following on it's \"About Me\" section:\n\n\"**What it is:**¬†An all-in-one AHA treatment, powered by lactic acid, that clarifies, smooths, and retexturizes the appearance of skin.\n\n**Skin Type:**¬†Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily\n\n**Skincare Concerns:**¬†Fine lines and wrinkles, Pores, Dark spots\"\n\nOk, all of that sounds great and just what I‚Äôm looking for- so far so good. If that doesn't sound like what you want from a product just bail at this point. Also, please never put any stock in the ‚ÄúClinical Results‚Äù section of the page that a lot of websites have. Go ahead and read the results for Good Genes and you'll see what I mean.\n\nNow I move on to the ingredients. I usually do a spot check on how far down any of their key ingredients are depending on the product (i.e. if it‚Äôs a serum or a moisturizer), but the most important part here for me is to throw the ingredients into Cosdna and see what pops out. I don‚Äôt put *huge* stock in comedogenic ratings, but I still want to know if there are any potentially acne-causing ingredients right up top. Likewise with irritants. **Note on Cosdna**: DO NOT TRUST THE PRODUCTS ALREADY IN COSDNA! Ever notice there are like 15 versions of popular products in the Cosdna database and all are like, 1-5 ingredient different from each other? Do **NOT** trust people to copy + paste properly. Not to mention companies change their formulations preeeetty frequently. No, take the time to copy the ingredients from the store's website (bonus points for hitting both the company‚Äôs website *and* the retailers, because if there is a formulation change it‚Äôll always be live for the company first- retailers can be slow to update) and paste them into Cosdna‚Äôs ‚Äúanalyze ingredients‚Äù section. [http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php)\n\nSo for Good Genes there is nothing I‚Äôm super jazzed about, and there are quite a few possibly comedogenic ingredients + a lot of fancy schmancy extracts (*Lady‚Äôs Slipper Orchid Extract?! Give me a f-ing break)* that I‚Äôm sure are like only grown on the Isle of Man and harvested by nubile young women after a milk bath or something bizarre. Given that there are a lot of potential acne triggers I‚Äôm going to be on the lookout for this in reviews. And feel free to tag in for my example of \"acne\" whatever your particular b√™te¬†noire is. If you have dry skin and a product has ingredients like alcohol and you‚Äôre like 'oh hey that‚Äôs drying' then you‚Äôll be watching for that in reviews.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Phase Two: The Reviews** *Reading how much people hate things and getting a lesson in how amazingly awful everyone‚Äôs spelling and grammar has become!*\n\nNow the fun part, let‚Äôs read some reviews! I am now going to share with you my secret to getting the deets on products, right after I tell you about Skillshare! Ha. Ok my secret: I don‚Äôt give two shits, or even *one* shit, about the positive reviews. I don‚Äôt care that someone thinks Good Genes is awesome. I mean frankly Oprah already told us it was awesome so if you think you‚Äôre better then Oprah then you‚Äôre stupid and wrong. No matter what site I‚Äôm on the first thing I do is filter by ‚ÄúLowest to Highest Rating.‚Äù (Side note: Ever wonder how to spot a fake review from a mile away without needing some computer to do the work? Ever notice how the 5 star reviews are always beautiful, ripe, lusciously complete sentences while the 1 stars are like ‚Äúthis waz trash i hat it awful!!!!‚Äù If a review *sounds* polished and put together it most likely was.) In the negative reviews what we are looking for are people with a similar skin type as ours and similar problems they're trying to address. You can pretty easily weed out the people who were hoping for miracles from a product or had an issue with areas outside the formula (company‚Äôs customer service, product size, product bottle, etc.) and focus in on those that could apply to you. Let‚Äôs snag up a good example for Good Genes from someone that seems to match my skin concerns:\n\n>\"Kind of bummed...  \n>  \n>I wanted so badly to love this. After all the hype and reading all the articles and reviews, I thought this would be magical. I used this faithfully as directed for two months and never noticed a difference in my skin. Nothing seemed brighter, smoother, tighter, etc. I actually stopped using it entirely after the two months because it really broke me out the whole time. I know some said there‚Äôs a ‚Äúpurging‚Äù period so I kept using it, but no purging period lasts two months. I usually have decently clear skin and this is the only item I changed in my routine that whole time. I gave the rest away to a friend who wanted to try it and hopefully they have better results.‚Äù\n\nSo honestly Good Genes isn‚Äôt sounding too bad after looking through a ton of bad reviews. Mostly people complaining about the smell which like if I can be blunt with you I‚Äôd probably put dog poo on my face if I would wake up with perfect skin- call me crazy. A few people reporting breakouts but some sound to me like purging. Ok Sunday, I‚Äôm intrigued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Phase Three: Surfing the Web** [*Tubular! Oh shit remember Johnny Tsunami?*](https://images.app.goo.gl/E6Mtr2ncQY5bhxEb7)\n\nAlright, the reviews didn‚Äôt turn us off and the ingredients are somewhat promising, so now comes what we'll call ‚Äòcasting a wider net‚Äô since we're looking further around the inter***net!*** Ha. **Pro-tip**\\- pretend no website ever has built in searching. I *promise* you it‚Äôs not as good as Google. Take freaking Reddit for example: ever used Reddit‚Äôs dumpster fire of a search feature?! Just use Google. First place I go to look for more reviews and info on a product is usually Reddit, so in this case I‚Äôd go to Google and type in ‚ÄúSunday Riley Good Genes Reddit‚Äù. I always start more generic and add in words as necessary- like if I needed to add ‚Äúreviews‚Äù on the end to get better results. Now I start picking through it all!  [As you can see here,](https://www.google.com/search?q=sunday+riley+good+genes+reddit&oq=sunday+riley+good+genes+reddit&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.5681j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) there are MANY posts talking about Good Genes already so you‚Äôll find out a lot about it from reading through them.\n\nFor products that are perhaps newer or just less well known, you might find you‚Äôll need to branch out from Reddit. In this case we‚Äôd just amend our previous Google search to read ‚ÄúSunday Riley Good Genes Review‚Äù. There are a fair few review sites out there (i.e. Influenster) as well as personal blogs that might have tried and reviewed the product. On sites like Influenster same rules apply- ignore positive reviews and sort by lowest to highest. Oh also **IGNORE AMAZON**! To be frank I never buy skin care off of Amazon (or TJ Maxx/Marshalls for that matter), and I would especially never buy something that‚Äôs not licensed to be sold on Amazon because the chances of it being a fake/tampered with/expired are around 100%. If you‚Äôre ever finding yourself purchasing something and it‚Äôs cheaper than retail price just walk away. Therefore Amazon‚Äôs reviews are useless, because these are people reviewing what is likely not the real product.\n\n‚ÄúWhat if my product is *brand* new or so obscure I can‚Äôt find reviews on it?‚Äù\n\nIf it‚Äôs brand new I‚Äôd suggest looking at similar products from that company if possible to get a feel for them. Unless you *KNOW* a particular ingredient set is exactly what you‚Äôre looking I'd advise waiting it out on new products or at the very least getting a sample. My skin is not something I enjoy being adventurous with (but I also said like 3 paragraphs up something about dog poop on my face? so I think I undercut my point here). If a product is not new, and you *still* can‚Äôt find *ANYTHING* on it I would: **MAKE SURE THE COMPANY IS LEGIT**!\n\nI have seen a lot of posts recently about people buying 'Provence Beauty' from TJ Maxx. I tried to help someone verify one of their products and couldn‚Äôt find ANYTHING on it. The brand themselves seems sketchy at best, and there is not a trace of any of the products that people purchased from TJ Maxx online. If the company seems iffy, *DO NOT BUY SKIN CARE FROM THEM!* It‚Äôs not worth it guys. If the company is legit, but just not very mainstream, you might have to go fishing a bit. I had this experience with Renee Rouleau‚Äôs products. This is the only time I actually *ask* a question in the Skin Care subreddit because you can find so much by just searching old posts. In this case I‚Äôd recommend heading to the Daily Questions thread and asking if anyone has ever tried {{product\\_name}}. If you can‚Äôt find anyone who has used it, and the company doesn‚Äôt do samples, make positively sure they do full refunds (and include return shipping!) because it‚Äôs always a gamble.\n\n**Phase Four: I want that.** *<‚Äî‚Äî- Napoleon Dynamite reference! Anyone? WTF that movie came out in 2004 Jesus Christ!*\n\nOk so at this point you‚Äôve probably made up your mind one way or another about a product and are ready to move forward. Often I find that my original product search has turned me on to a similar product and I am therefore performing this complex mating ritual with several products simultaneously before selecting the most dominant.\n\nOnce I have one I‚Äôm serious about your first question should be ‚ÄúCan I get a sample?‚Äù Ok guys here is the shitty thing with samples of Skin Care- using something for like three days in a row isn‚Äôt going to affect you dramatically one way or the other *unless* you have extreme sensitivities. However it *will* help you weed out little things like texture, smell (lol god smell again), feel (too greasy? too oily?), and how it plays with your other products (i.e. pilling). I always get a sample before I buy something if at all possible. Now if it‚Äôs *not* possible due to the availability (online only) or the packaging of the product, I‚Äôd recommend seeking out a travel size. Funnily enough this is exactly what I did with Good Genes (my take on it? Like basically the skin care equivalent of the shrugging emoji). I found my biggest problem was I‚Äôd buy a full-size product since it‚Äôs a bEtTeR vAlUe and then never ever finish it because I‚Äôd get right past that point of no return (like literally, can‚Äôt return it anymore) and then decide it wasn‚Äôt doing it and thank you next it (as someone hovering around 30 I can truthfully say I‚Äôve never even heard that song which you can probably tell). So the hierarchy of purchasing goes: **Sample ‚Äî> Travel-size ‚Äî> Smallest size available** ***from the store with the best return policy!***\n\nSephora has a pretty fantastic return policy, so they‚Äôre usually my default. Oh Ulta too. I have this weird snobbish thing about Sephora being somehow better than Ulta? **If you are buying online** be diligent about checking return policies! With skin care you need to find out the following:\n\n* How long do I have to return?\n* Can I return open and/or used product? Is it unconditional or based on their discretion?\n* Does the company pay for my return or will return shipping be deducted from my refund?\n* Is this site well known and liked?\n\nFor that last point I‚Äôd recommend a similar vetting process as the one you just went through for the product itself. For ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô sites like Sephora, Dermstore, major department stores, etc. (lol Ulta didn‚Äôt make the list again! Maybe it‚Äôs the orange? Is orange just not classy enough?) you can do a spot check of reviews for their customer service, but on the whole this is going to be far more important for niche sites, smaller companies, and Korean/International beauty sites! Doing a Google search for, say, ‚ÄúYesstyle reddit reviews‚Äù or some combo of that will net you most everything you need to know. Once again if you can‚Äôt find *anything* on a company I‚Äôd steer clear. If you find a product that is still being manufactured (like Good Genes) and it‚Äôs cheaper on the website you're looking at then it normally retails for then *it is cheaper for a reason!* Now companies do have sales, so if Neiman Marcus has 15% off skin care or whatever that‚Äôs different, but on the whole if some random seller on eBay is selling Good Genes for $30 that‚Äôs not a good deal, that‚Äôs herpes. Or hepatitis or.. something idk diseases I guess.\n\nNote on Product Returns: I mean obviously as with most things in life the 11th commandment of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a dick‚Äù applies here and you shouldn‚Äôt abuse company‚Äôs return policies. I frankly don‚Äôt really give a shit about a company‚Äôs bottom line so much as it‚Äôs just a huge waste of time and resources. But that said if you‚Äôre on the fence about a product after a week or so *RETURN IT!* I have done this with many products that I just wasn‚Äôt crazy about (lookin at you Protini) and have never regretted and/or repurchased anything yet. You WILL regret keeping around lackluster products.\n\nActives do create another can of worms with regards to purging and how long you should wait it out, and honestly I could write another post just about purging. Despite some controversy in my super important opinion purging is most definitely a **Thing**. To be *super* brief about it and distill this down to the key points to ask yourself when you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúIs this a purge or a breakout?‚Äù I would have to say it hinges upon two factors: **Where am I breaking out** and **what do the pimples look like**. Ooh I‚Äôm going to make a FLOW CHART!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\*Updated Flow Chart](https://preview.redd.it/7r0cwu4cr6u31.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cef4897baf6f5989202b40eeb217bce74c3911a)\n\n[(Link to said flow chart on Imgur if you want to look at it in Imgur I gues)](https://imgur.com/c06E8vG)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk that‚Äôs a lot of info so I‚Äôll stop there. Notice I didn‚Äôt ask my friends about products they use because A. I don‚Äôt have any friends and B. Unless they have very similar skin it‚Äôs not really going to matter, but you could always include a ‚Äòhuman contact‚Äô portion of the vetting process if that‚Äôs your thing. Let me know if you have any questions about any of this as, I know vetting products can be really overwhelming for some people and I‚Äôd love to help you feel more secure in your purchases and find products that will actually work for you!

When ATP is hydrolysed, a hydrogen ion is released. ATP-derived hydrogen ions are primarily responsible for the decrease in pH. During intense exercise, aerobic metabolism cannot produce ATP quickly enough to supply the demands of the muscle. As a result, anaerobic metabolism becomes the dominant energy producing pathway as it can form ATP at high rates. Due to the large amounts of ATP being produced and hydrolysed in a short period of time, the buffering systems of the tissues are overcome, causing pH to fall and creating a state of acidosis, a natural process which facilitates the easier dissociation of Oxyhaemoglobin and allows easier transfer of oxygen from the blood[2]. This may be one factor, among many, that contributes to the acute muscular discomfort experienced shortly after intense exercise.[citations needed]\n\n[Primary source - pdf of journal article](http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/287/3/R502.pdf)",

When the lactic acid is being produced at a greater rate than your body can convert it to energy, then it just accumulates and does nothing for you. That is why people who get their blood lactate levels tested work on reducing this excess lactic acid. They work out at their lactate threshold, which accustoms the body to being able to use more and more lactic acid, which in turn makes them better and faster. Eventually, their bodies become more efficient at converting lactic acid to energy, and less lactic acid is wasted in the excess buildup.\n\nSo even if lactic acid isn't really what causes your muscles to burn during a workout, the production of too much of it is a sign that you are not as aerobically fit as you can be.",

    "body": "Hello /r/Fitness!\n\nLike many basketball players (or athletes), my biggest goal in basketball training had been to dunk. However, being a 5'9 white guy with average genetics who didn't do much lifting, it was something that seemed like small possibility. Nevertheless, I decided that I would at least try to ameliorate my jumping skills. I know a lot of people ask about training specifically for the vertical jump, so I thought that I would upload a routine that I use that really helped me get over the hump\n\n**Where I started from**\n\nRight when I started to actually take lifting exercises seriously, my standing vertical was roughly 30 inches (I didn't have legit equipment to measure) and my standing reach was 90 inches. To make this more visual, if at full force I ran up and tried to grab the rim, I could firmly grab it with my dominant hand and pull the rim down but could not get high enough to hang on with one hand. If I threw a self-alley oop, I was close to dunking but the combination of weak grip strength and not jumping high enough hindered me. Also, I'm 20 years old\n\n**My workout routine**\n\nTo structure my workout, I based it around N-suns 5 day program because 1) it's highly regarded in this sub, 2) I wanted to improve my lifts linearly and wanted to take advantage of his spreadsheet and calculations. Regarding my choice for the leg exercises, I decided which ones to use based on conversations I had with friends who play college football and exercises used by two personal trainers of NBA players. Also, I did not do Deadlifts because I've never had someone to consistently critique my form and have a history of lower back injuries. \n\nLink to the Nsuns template: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8EbfzFB0mBrSjBFZ1NUUklHU1E/view\n\n**Day 1** - Bench/OHP day with accessories of: \n\nChin ups 4x12 \n\nT-bar rows 4x12\n\nIncline bench 3x8-12\n\nDecline Skullcrusher/CG bench superset 3x12\n\nBarbell Curl 4x8\n\nL-Sit 1x max time\n\nAb Mat work - Used this Greg Plitt ab circuit that really killed me the first time I tried it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW49kMuDoaQ .\n\n**Day 2** - Leg day focused on Back Squat\n\nBefore I started lifting the weights, I always spent at least 25 minutes doing a dynamic warmup. It's very important to warm up dynamically in order to prevent injury. I would do this warm-up before every leg workout\n\n1. Run laps/jog for 5 minutes to get heart rate up\n2. Jump rope for 1 minute\n3. Foam roll my back, hamstrings, glutes, IT band, and calves\n4. Monster walks forward and backwards and side steps with a theraband - ~15 yards \n5. Forward/backwards and 15 steps to each side\n6. Agilities - things like high knees, buttkicks, karaoke, slides, A/B skips, etc.\n7. Core work - 1 min plank, 30 seconds side plank each side, 1 minute hollow hold, 30 seconds superman hold\n8. Plyometric work - dot jumps, depth jumps, tuck jumps, lateral jumps\n\n3x5 Power Cleans - I always start my leg workouts with a big power movement. Before I learned proper clean form, I used a single arm dumbbell snatch because the learning curve is much faster\n\nBack squats (look at N-Suns template for rep scheme) - \n\n4x8 Band resisted trap bar deadlift - It doesn't have to be band resisted, but I like using the band for eccentric loading\n\n3x8 Bulgarian Split Squat \n\n3x8 Single leg deadlift\n\n2x20 Hanging six count Dumbbell Burpees. I got this exercise from trainer Tim Manson (he trained NBA player Nate Robinson) and it's definitely one of the most grueling leg exercises I've done, especially at the end of a workout.\n\nVideo link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s5Lu4K2i6Q\n\nConditioning - 2 sets of \"17s\" - a 17 is conditioning drill used by many college basketball teams. You run from sideline to sideline on the short side of the basketball court (15 meters/yards if you dont have a court); each time you get to the other side, that counts as one rep. The goal is to do it in just minute but then again that is the standard for collegiate athletes. I only added this because I wanted some sort of way to make sure I was in running shape.\n\n\nAb work - Hanging leg raises for however many sets it took to reach 100\n\n\nAfter all the leg work was done, I would spend run laps or ride the stationary bike for about 5 minutes to cool down and then do static stretching for 15 minutes to recover. I really emphasized stretching out my hip flexors because they are really important not only for progressing in lower body lifts, but for jumping.\n\n**Day 3** - OHP/Incline Bench with accessories of\n\nFlat Dumbbell press - 4x12,10,10,8, increasing by 5 pounds whenever I dropped the reps\n\nChin ups 4x12\n\nFacepulls SS Lateral raises 3x12\n\nHammer Curls SS Weighted Dips 3x12\n\nL-sit 1x max hold\n\nAb work - Stability ball work. First, I would hold a 1 minute plank with my feet on the ball. Then, I would do the \"stir the pot\" exercise go for 30 seconds forward and back, 30 sec to the right, and 30 sec then to the left. I would rest 30 seconds in between each direction.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3z8aQpu5bw\n\n**Day 4** - On the N-Suns program, the second leg day is here, but I like to have more recovery time in between leg workouts. I usually will still go to the gym and do some stationary bike or some form of cardio to get lactic acid out.\n\n**Day 5** - Leg day with Trap Bar deadlift as main lift\n\nSame warm-up as day 2\n\n3x8 Band resisted Kettlebell swing - I add the band in order to get more eccentric loading as I did with the trap bar deadlift. \n\nTrap Bar deadlift - using N-Suns rep scheme as the main lift instead of deadlift. \n\nFront Squat - using N-Suns rep scheme and weights\n\nDumbbell Step up - 3x12\n\nSwiss ball single leg squat - 3x8 on each leg\n\n2x15 back hyperextentions\n\n**Day 6** Bench/Close grip bench with accessories of\n\nChin ups 4x12\n\nT bar row 4x10\n\nSpider Curl SS Hammer Curls 3x12\n\nTriceps pushdown SS FacePulls 3x12\n\nL sit 1x max hold\n\nAb work - Medicine ball work\n\n\n**Video Progress of dunking**\n\nAfter week 2 - My first dunk!\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/254057666\n\nAfter week 5:\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/254058065\n\nAfter week 7 - \n\nhttps://vimeo.com/254057278\n\nIf you have any questions about why certain exercises were chosen or just in general, I'd be glad answer!\n\nEdit: Links should work now\n\nEdit 2: okay, now the links should work",

Lo and behold, my vertical was drastically improved and I was dunking all over the place. One of my friends even had a rim in his backyard that was installed about 4\" too high, and I could dunk that. I like to think it was mostly the volleyball, but it was probably that combined with the normal PT regimen in the Marines (running, pull ups, pushups, etc.). I didn't do any other workouts, legs or otherwise, other than PT and volleyball. Granted, I was much leaner, and had a stronger core, so there is that.",

    "body": "Happened upon a guide from a dermatology magazine from ye olde days of circa 2004 which outlined in laymen's terms the core principles of cleansing and moisturizing for different skin types and conditions. These basic key points haven't changed in well over several decades, despite all the gimmicks and new breakthroughs. Thought it'd be an interesting read for both skincare newbies just embarking on their journey and enthusiasts alike. \n\n \n\n# Making the Choice\n\nEvery patient needs to cleanse and moisturize skin properly using suitable cleansers and moisturizers containing the appropriate ingredients. In patients with compromised or sensitive skin, proper cleaning and moisturizing is even more critical. Using too harsh a cleanser or an inappropriate moisturizer can, in many cases, exacerbate certain conditions and can cause contact dermatitis and other problems. \n\nThe plethora of cleansers and moisturizers available today makes it difficult to keep current with new ingredients and their actions ‚Äî or to guide patients in the selection of these products. In addition, few trials have looked at cleansers and moisturizers and their therapeutic value. \n\n‚ÄúDermatologists must understand the ingredients in the products their patients use and what they do to or for the skin. However, the market changes quickly and it is very difficult to keep up,‚Äù says Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D., P.A., Clinical Associate Professor, in the Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest University. ‚ÄúThey need to keep abreast of this as much as they keep abreast of any aspect of their medical practice by reading journals and going to meetings This aspect of the dermatology practice is just as important as any other since cleansers and moisturizers have a dramatic impact on the skin.‚Äù \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Moisturizer:**\n\nXerosis occurs when the water content in the skin is less than 10% to 20% ‚Äî depending on the measurement method, and there is a loss of continuity of the stratum corneum. While moisturizers cannot repair skin, they can help restore the skin barrier and protect the skin as it heals. \n\n‚ÄúMoisturizers need to stop water loss, decrease itching and burning, and make the skin feel smooth and soft,‚Äù says Dr. Draelos. ‚ÄúThis creates an optimal environment for healing. Because the skin turns over every two weeks, healing can occur rapidly.‚Äù \n\nA good moisturizer should also be hypoallergenic, non-sensitizing, and non-comedogenic. The ingredients in moisturizers are often divided into occlusive agents, humectants, and emollients. \n\nOcclusive agents physically prevent or retard water loss. The most effective occlusive moisturizer is petrolatum. Lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones, such as dimethicone, are also very effective occlusive moisturizers. Applying an occlusive moisturizer immediately after bathing may be an effective way to trap additional water in the skin. \n\nHumectants attract and bind water and can improve the hydration of the stratum corneum. Effective humectants include propylene glycol, glycerin, urea, hyaluronic acid, and pyrrolidone carboxylate (NaPCA). However, high levels of humectants can draw water from surrounding cells and can actually dry the skin further. if not trapped by an occlusive agent. \n\nEmollients soften or soothe the skin by filling spaces between skin flakes and creating a smooth skin surface. They are usually light oily substances, such as octyl octanoate, sesame oil, grape seed oil, or cetyl stearate. Some emollients can also function as occlusive moisturizers. When combined with an emulsifier, the oily emollients are thoroughly mixed with the other water-soluble ingredients in the moisturizer. Emollients are probably the most important consumer ingredient in moisturizers since they provide the smooth skin feel associated with well-moisturized skin. \n\nMoisturizers may contain additional additives such as vitamins E, A, C, niacin, panthenol, peptides, polyphenols, aloe vera, and others. Alpha hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid or glycolic acid, may also be added to decrease cohesion of the excess stratum corneum cells, reducing roughness and scaling. The special ingredients are designed to function as cosmeceuticals imparting unique attributes to standard moisturizer formulations.\n\n Their final efficacy depends on how much of the ingredient is in the moisturizer and how the final formulation interacts with the skin. Despite their benefits, many patients resist using the most effective moisturizers since they often have unappealing characteristics. \n\n‚ÄúPetrolatum is actually the very best moisturizer available, but it stains clothing, smells bad, and is greasy,‚Äù says Dr. Draelos. ‚ÄúEvery other moisturizer on the market is trying to achieve the benefits of white petrolatum without the bad aesthetic effects.‚Äù \n\nAccording to Dr. Draelos, a good moisturizer should start with an occlusive agent, such as petrolatum or mineral oil, which is not as thick or greasy. It should also include occlusive ingredients that reduce greasiness, such as dimethicone, a type of silicone. \n\n‚ÄúYou might add grape seed, sesame, or some other lightweight oil and emollients, such as cetearyl alcohol,‚Äù says Dr. Draelos. ‚ÄúThese are oils that can fit between the dry skin cells and make the skin feel smooth and soft.‚Äù It is also now possible to synthetically produce ceramides, which are some of the newest occlusive agents to enter the marketplace. \n\nDr. Draelos is excited about some of the newer developments in moisturizers. ‚ÄúThe next generation of moisturizers are moisturizers used in a shower. Patients put the moisturizer on in the shower, and then rinse off. This novel technology effectively moisturizes the skin with long-lasting effects and is known as a new category of skincare products known as moisturizes.‚Äù *(These are available to us now.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Cleanser:**\n\nExcessive cleaning can damage the skin by washing out the natural humectant agents, change the pH value of the skin, and cause irritant contact dermatitis. \n\n‚ÄúCleansing damages the skin because the soap cannot distinguish between unwanted dirt and intercellular lipids,‚Äù says Dr. Draelos. ‚ÄúSynthetic detergents known as syndets are not as effective at removing dirt, but they do not remove as many intercellular lipids and are pH adjusted. A good alternative is the newer body washes that remove dirt, but leave behind a thin layer of petrolatum, especially if used with a puff.‚Äù \n\nWhen cleansing, all patients should use warm ‚Äî not hot ‚Äî water and bathe for not more than 10 minutes. Cleansing agents should be spread sparingly on the wet skin and, after briefly taking effect, completely rinsed off. \n\n‚ÄúWhen looking for a cleanser, most patients should avoid cleaners with parabens, fragrances and detergents. Patients should also avoid detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,‚Äù says Leslie S. Baumann, M.D., Director of Cosmetic Dermatology at the University of Miami. ‚ÄúIngredients to look for depend on the skin type, but acne-prone patients should look for cleansers with salicylic acid, while those with rosacea would look for sulfacetamide.‚Äù \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Acne** \n\nSome people with acne may try to stop outbreaks and oil production by scrubbing their skin and using strong detergent soaps and rough scrub pads. However, scrubbing will not improve acne; in fact, it can make the problem worse. Astringents are not recommended unless the skin is very oily, and then they should be used only on oily spots. \n\nPatients with acne should use a mild cleanser (5% benzoyl peroxide wash), once in the morning, once in the evening, and after heavy exercise. Acne suffers generally have oily skin, but the skin barrier can be compromised by treatment, leading to flaking and itching. \n\n‚ÄúI recommend skin lubricants in the silicone family like cyclomethicone and dimethicone, which soften and hydrate without oils,‚Äù explains Mary Lupo, M.D., a dermatologist in private practice in New Orleans and professor of dermatology at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans. ‚ÄúCleansers should be mild if on treatment, but high surfactant cleansers or those with salicylic acid are good for oily and acne-prone skin.‚Äù \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Eczema & Other Dermatoses** \n\nAny skin disease will benefit from a moisturizer that strengthens the stratum corneum barrier, even blistering bullous pemphigoid. Moisturizing with a good moisturizer is also very important for a disease such as psoriasis. \n\n‚ÄúSince this is a disease characterized by hyperkeratosis, keratolytics can play an important role in its treatment. Propylene glycol and lactic acid can be sole, or integral parts, of treatment regimens by effectively removing adherent scales,‚Äù says Andrea Trowers, M.D., a pediatric dermatologist who has completed a fellowship in pediatric dermatology at the University of Miami. \n\n‚ÄúPlastic wrap, plastic gloves or plastic shower caps can be used to occlude the affected area after application of a keratolytic, resulting in increased efficacy.‚Äù Patients with eczema usually have an impaired stratum corneum barrier so they can benefit from a moisturizer that will help replace cholesterol, ceramides, and fatty acids. The only skin diseases that generally do not benefit from a moisturizer are conditions that are skin manifestations of internal diseases such as skin cancer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Photoaged Skin** \n\nPhotoaged skin is generally treated with retinoids, which can dry the skin, especially during winter. For these patients, applying a moisturizer is helpful. The best moisturizing agent is petroleum jelly, but it is too greasy for most people, though a creamy version is available that is almost as moisturizing as the original. If other moisturizers are used, they should be the cream versions of the moisturizer. \n\n‚ÄúPatients with photo-aged skin should avoid detergent cleansers with lots of surfactants. And they should look for added emollients like petrolatum to soothe,‚Äù explains Dr. Lupo. ‚ÄúSodium laurel sulfate and many polysorbates can be very drying. Moisturizers with safflower oils and ceramide complexes are good. Humectants like glycerin are good as well.‚Äù \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ethnic Skin** \n\nPatients with darker skin tones, often referred to as ‚Äúethnic skin,‚Äù have special concerns. ‚ÄúEthnic skin is generally no more or less sensitive than lighter skin and all the same precautions apply,‚Äù says Heather Woolery-Lloyd, M.D., Director of Ethnic Skin Care for the University of Miami Department of Dermatology. ‚ÄúHowever, ethnic or darker skin is subject to certain conditions not usually associated with lighter skin, such as hyperpigmentation following irritation.‚Äù \n\nIf a cleanser or moisturizer causes an irritation on a fair-skinned person, any redness heals and the skin returns to its normal appearance. However, a darker-skinned individual may be left with dark brown patches on their skin, which is especially bothersome if it occurs on the face. E\n\nExcessive scrubbing and harsh cleansers in patients with conditions such as rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis heighten susceptibility to irritation that can lead to hyperpigmentation. Those patients should use the mildest cleanser and least irritating moisturizers. \n\n‚ÄúWhile it is difficult to specifically predict which individuals will be irritated by a particular ingredient, a dermatologist should make sure that patients use products with fewer known irritants,‚Äù says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. ‚ÄúSoapless cleansers are generally milder than traditional soaps and are especially useful in patients with sensitive skin prone to irritation. Additionally, traditional soaps combine with minerals in hard water and can leave an unwanted residue on skin and hair.‚Äù \n\nPatients with pseudofolliculitis barbae may find that cleansers with glycolic acid offer some relief. In addition, shaving gels with salicylic acid can be effective against in-grown hairs. However, these products can be very irritating and should not be used for individuals with sensitive skin. Another issue with darker skin is the ashy appearance of the skin when it becomes dry. While not necessarily a medical issue, it is still of concern to darker-skinned individuals. \n\n‚ÄúPatients with dry, ashy skin will find products with lactic acid or urea to be effective,‚Äù says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. ‚ÄúBecause they not only moisturize and hydrate the skin, but they also exfoliate the superficial dry scale.‚Äù \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Elderly Skin** \n\nSince elderly patients do not produce a lot of sebum, their skin is dry and prone to itchiness. As a result, the elderly need to be especially careful about skincare. They should wash less frequently and should avoid cleansers as much as possible, relying almost exclusively on warm, not hot, water to rinse away surface dirt. Mild soap, such as glycerin soap, should only be used for local cleaning of, especially soiled areas. The elderly should moisturize frequently, especially after bathing when the skin is still moist. Bath oil can also be used, but patients must be careful about slipping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Young Skin** \n\nMoisturizing is very important in pre-pubescent children since they do not produce a lot of sebum, and they generally get dirtier and require frequent bathing, which dries the skin. ‚ÄúAs far as moisturizers, individuals with healthy skin can use most of the products. Just pick a product that leaves skin smooth, not tight or greasy,‚Äù says Dr. Lupo. ‚ÄúA combination moisturizer and sunscreen is an excellent choice because you can hydrate the skin and have the added benefit of preventing aging skin and skin cancers.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYoung children with ethnic skin who have dry skin ‚Äî especially those living in colder climates ‚Äî can relieve the dryness and alleviate the ashy appearance by using products like petroleum jelly or even vegetable shortening that has been refrigerated for a cooling effect,‚Äù says Dr. Trowers. \n\nOlder children often resist this approach because of the greasy feel, but products such as Cetaphil emollient cream can be almost as effective, with better cosmetic tolerance. According to Dr. Trowers, children of all skin types who suffer from atopic dermatitis often have more bacteria on the surface of the skin. More severe cases can be cleansed below the neck with chlorhexidine, or in milder cases with a product such as Cetaphil anti-bacterial soap, then bathed in a solution of Alpha Keri bath oil. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Understanding the Ingredients:**\n\nConsidering the difference that proper cleansing and moisturizing can make to dermatology patients, it is essential that every dermatologist understand the ingredients that go into moisturizers and cleansers ‚Äî and the impact that those ingredients have on a patient‚Äôs skin. \n\n‚ÄúGood practice in cleansing and moisturizing can make a significant difference for patients with certain skin conditions and as a therapeutic response to the side effects of medications used for treatment,‚Äù says Dr. Baumann. ‚ÄúIt is very important for dermatologists and their patients to become familiar with the individual ingredients in moisturizers and cleansers and to know what they really do. Without this knowledge, you may not be able to respond appropriately because your patient has come in with an unfamiliar product, and you are unable to offer sound medical advice.‚Äù \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n*Source: The Dermatologist Volume 12,  Issue 6,  June 2004*",

And, sadly, confirmation about the state of an important piece of equipment.*\n\n*Enjoy.*\n\n*Edit: I'm not gonna pretend to know how anyone on the spectrum feels about their lives. I'm not on it so I have no frame of reference. Joey's speech is actually based very closely on the way someone I know worked through their issues with being on the spectrum. But I in no way wish to cheapen anyone else's experiences.*\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nJames held the handle gently as he inspected the once marvelous weapon. It was hard to tell in the multi-colored, low, lighting of the crystalline room, but he felt like its once bluish grey blade had dimmed.\n\n\"Kai.\" He said softly as he gripped what was left of the mage's blade. \"Can you cast any offensive magic?\"\n\n\"I can.\" Kai replied.\n\n\"Would you mind building up an attack against me for a moment?\" James requested. \"No need to actually attack. Just act like you're going to.\"\n\nKai looked at him curiously. He could tell that James wasn't alright. So he didn't question the odd request. He gathered energy into his hand. Small, black and blue flames danced on his finger tips.\n\nJames looked at the oddly colored flames with mild curiosity.\n\nIt was hard to tell, but he thought he felt just the slightest twitch from the sword, then it seemed to vibrate lightly for a second before stilling again.\n\nThe oddness of the feeling within James wasn't lost on him. He knew the blade had been semi-sentient, in the fashion that any enchanted item could be. It wasn't like it had ever SPOKEN to him, or used its animated nature to write him any messages. It had only ever driven him toward magical danger, and even tried to pull him into fights that he had no business being in.\n\nBut... it had also saved his life more times than he could count. And it WAS still a present from Amina and the King.\n\nAnd it was his sword.\n\nLooking down at the piece in his hand. At the two fragments lying on the small piece of cloth on his lap.\n\nIt felt like he'd lost another friend. Seeing its ruined state had felt akin to when he'd realized he was missing a hand after the battle with the elemental that had ruined the capital.\n\nAs if he'd lost a part of his body.\n\nAnd that was to say nothing of the handle to his chain, which sat on the table with only a handful of links still attached to it. He'd had that weapon even longer. Since his first REAL battle in this world. The one that had set him on the path toward a future with Amina at his side.\n\n\"Is there a blacksmith in this fortress?\" He asked after staring at the two fragmented weapons for several seconds more.\n\nKai nodded. \"There are.\"\n\n\"Any of them good with enchantments?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Kai admitted. \"I haven't been to this place in several decades now. But I'd be surprised if there weren't.\"\n\nJames nodded and wrapped the sword back in its cloth bundle. He put both of them back in the repaired bottomless bag. Once they were in he pulled out some new clothes and a handful of armor pieces that he hadn't worn in months and began putting them on. He also drew out his shield and the plain steel sword he'd gotten from Kraug back when he was still new to this world.\n\n\"Will you be needing this?\" Kai asked as James's assault rifle lowered from the ceiling.\n\nJames looked at it, doing what he could to hide his discomfort at the elf still having it.\n\n\"No.\" He said as he grabbed it. \"But I will take it back.\" The weapon held fast, secured by unseen spider webs that even James's strength struggled to break. He let go. \"Kai?\"\n\n\"I need your word that you are no threat to my people.\" The elf said sternly. \"That you're not aligned with these.... 'muck marchers' as you call them.\"\n\nJames's jaw clenched as he stared ahead, not looking at the elf.\n\n\"Kai.\" He said after several long seconds of silent anger. \"I owe you my life. Several times over from the sounds of things.\" He looked over at the dark elf, who met his gaze with no expression. He continued. \"So I'm not a threat to you or yours. As for whether I'm 'aligned' with them. I've already told you that TECHNICALLY we serve the same government... more or less. But I don't kill people just for being around like they did.\" He placed his left hand on the rifle's stock and pulled, using his magic and wolf enhanced strength to break the invisible threads with audible twangs. \"But I DO kill people that fuck with me.\" He said as he stuffed the rifle into his bag. \"And if I see THEM... we're gonna have words about what they did. Both to the dwarves and to me.\" He said as he looked down at his still sore body.\"\n\nKai's eyebrow raised at the display of anger.\n\nThen he nodded and James heard his harp send out several sharp chords. He looked back just in time to see several spiders retreat back up their webs and out of sight.\n\n\"I'll take you down to the fortress market.\" Kai said after a moment. \"We'll see about getting your items repaired. Then we can leave for the surface at your leisure.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" James said as he slid his pistol holster onto his belt and clasped it in place. Then he snapped the pistol into the holster with a click. \"And thank you for... healing... me.\"\n\nKai nodded solemnly. \"When you get to your people. See about getting to a human healer.\" Kai said. \"Myself and the sporesman may have healed your body. But spiders and fungi can do very little for souls.\"\n\nJames didn't say anything as he strapped the now multi-colored bottomless bag to his back.\n\n\"This way.\" Kai said as his spiders opened the sliding main door.\n\n\\---------------\n\n\"Sooo.\" Joey began as he and Veliry sat, reading notes in the lab. \"Why is my energy different from yours? Or even James's?\" He asked, causing his teacher to look up at him curiously.\n\n\"That's right. James let you use the monocle didn't he?\" She said in response as she set her notes down.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Joey said as he squeezed his left eye shut and strained. To Veliry's surprise, after a moment Joey's right eye began to glow with a dull orange light. He looked around for a moment, then shut the eye and began blinking rapidly. \"I don't get why he can't do that spell yet.\" He said. \"I mean. It's difficult. And startlingly energy inefficient. But it's not anything special.\"\n\nVeliry stared at him in shock for a moment. \"You can already see magical energy?\" She asked. \"I haven't even taught you that yet.\" She reached across the table and pried his eye open with one hand, causing him to flinch and look away. Her own eyes glowed in the same light as she studied him. \"And it's only energy inefficient because you aren't as magically saturated as the rest of us yet. That's why I haven't taught you any body altering abilities yet.\"\n\nJoey pulled back, swatting her hand away lightly as he did, then began rubbing at his eye.\n\n\"That still doesn't explain why mine and James's energy looks different from everyone else's.\" He said. \"Also, all I did was read notes and visualized what the monocle showed me. The rest was just focus.\"\n\nVeliry sat back, impressed at her student's unexpected progress. *He's learning faster than James did.* She thought. *Hell. He's learning faster than I did. And I'm the third youngest Arch Mage in the history of the kingdom.*\n\nShe took a deep breath. She'd actually been curious about the difference herself. And she thought she had an idea as to the reason. But she hadn't been able to confirm from the books James had brought over, and the information available on her tablet was spotty on the subject at best. But it also seemed like the kind of subject that might require.... delicacy.\n\n\"Your brother tells me that you suffer from a.... condition.... known as Autism.\" She said hesitantly. \"That it makes you process information differently than other people.\"\n\n\"I don't consider it suffering.\" Joey said simply, Veliry relaxed at the easy tone. \"And I doubt James used that term either.\" He said as he sat up a bit straighter. \"I... struggle with it... sometimes. But... I've never known any other way of being.\" His left hand shot up for a moment and she worried that it was going to clamp onto his ear. But instead it simply scratched the side of his head. \"It's... difficult. Sometimes. But, compared to some of the people I've met who are also on the spectrum, I got off pretty light.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" She asked, legitimately curious.\n\n\"Well.\" He said. \"I'm what's considered 'high functioning'. I can speak to people. I can learn new things, albeit with difficulty sometimes. I can live a... more or less, normal life.\"\n\n\"I'll say.\" She said. \"You're learning magic at a startling rate.\"\n\n\"That's part of it though.\" He said, his hand tapping at his leg a bit. A sign she'd learned meant that he'd been just a bit annoyed at something, likely her interruption. \"I.... like magic. Just like I like video games and anime... and mechanical engineering. I can.... get obsessed with these subjects very easily and, as you've seen, I can get so caught up in them that I forget basic things. Like.... dinner with my mom and James. Or... eating at all.\"\n\nShe nodded. They had needed to set a schedule for him to stop researching and check in with his mother AND take care of personal responsibilities very quickly once his mother had realized that he'd had a new obsession. Veliry had felt somewhat uncomfortable due to how much it had reminded her of how SHE could get when she was diving too deep into her studies. Now Joey had a series of alarms, some of which had already been in place, on his phone to remind him to stop his studies for a while and check his basic needs.\n\n\"On the one hand.\" He continued, breaking her out of her thoughts. \"If I find a subject I like... I learn it quickly... and completely. I... can't help it. I can list off the animators and voice actors of over a hundred animes from back home.\" His head tilted a bit. \"BUT... I also struggle to focus on things that I don't... care.... about. Like I said; I love mechanical engineering. And back home I wanted to become a mechanical engineer. But I...\" He shook his head a bit and his left hand rose up a bit toward his ear before he firmly pressed it back to his lap. \"I hate.... math. I cannot stand it. And... in my brain... that makes it very difficult for me to focus on anything math related. Which is.... an issue... for an aspiring engineer since it's necessary for it.\" His head dipped and he stared at his hands. \"It took me three attempts to pass my Trig class.\" He said softly, as if more to himself than to her. \"But I liked learning how things work together, and wanted to get into that field. So, with a... LOT... of help. I eventually got through it.\"\n\nVeliry didn't interrupt.\n\n\"I also struggle with social interactions.\" He said softly. \"I have a hard time reading boundaries and social cues that other people take for granted. When I get really excited about a subject I can talk about it for hours, but not everybody wants to hear about something that long. When we were kids, if James caught me babbling to someone like that he would tap me on the shoulder.\" As if by muscle memory Joey's hand reached up and rapidly tapped at his collar bone three times with two fingers. \"It was how he reminded me to ask the person I was talking to whether or not they cared about what I was talking about.\" He said this as if it made him sad. \"But I struggled to understand how people COULDN'T be interested in the same thing. So that made accepting their answers to that question difficult too.\"\n\nNow that he mentioned it, she hadn't noticed the habit of his because she tended to do the same thing, though people usually just ignored her and walked away after a while. But she remembered that he'd talked her ear off a few times, she just hadn't realized it at the time because he'd done so about magic, and that was something SHE could talk about for hours.\n\n\"And as you've seen a few times.\" He continued. \"I also get overwhelmed if too many things are happening at once. Or if something unexpected or bad happens.\" He looked back down at his hands and seemed to realize how hard they were tapping at his legs. \"Plus I have a few automatic reactions to certain situations that I do reflexively. Like my hands right now.\" He said as he lifted them and forced the fingers to spread and clench repeatedly. \"Or when I press them to my ears.\" He pressed them together as if praying before setting them to his sides and looking up and away from them.\n\nHe was quiet for a moment. \"You said you don't consider it suffering.\" She mused. \"Yet you refer to these things as struggles.\"\n\n\"Well. Yeah.\" He said. He looked at her for a moment with a smile, before his eyes darted away again. \"Like I said. I've never known any other way to be. I was born this way. It makes my life difficult, sure.\" The smile faded again. \"And I know it's made my mom's life difficult. And James's. And my dad's when he was still alive.\" He looked back up and the smile came back. \"And I used to think of it as a struggle. But... one of my therapists gave me a challenge during one of my sessions with them. Told me to ask James a question since he was becoming a nursing student.\"\n\nVeliry tilted her head in curiosity.\n\n\"She told me to ask James about muscle hypertrophy. Do you know what that is?\" He asked.\n\nVeliry thought about it. She thought she might have read something about it in one of the medical books James had given them. But she couldn't remember it. She shook her head.\n\n\"Muscle hypertrophy is when muscles, through strain or overuse, get little tears in them. It actually happens all the time. It's part of why, if you work out or go for a long walk or run, your muscles can be sore for the rest of the day, or even days after if you went too hard.\" He said in a rapid, yet familiar excitement. \"Well. That and lactic acid.\"\n\n\"Okay?\" She said curiously. \"What does this have to do with the way you think?\"\n\n\"Well.\" He said with a smile. \"James explained it to me. That's only the first half of muscular hypertrophy. The second half is that your muscles heal. They make little miniature scars over the tears they made. That scar tissue BECOMES muscle too. As a result your muscles get bigger and, as long as you keep working out, they get stronger over time. It turns out bones do something similar, but for them its not about size, but density.\"\n\nShe thought about the concept. It made sense in theory. Though, medical knowledge and healing weren't her specialty. She'd have to ask one of the healers about it.\n\n\"I still don't understand how that relates to you switching from thinking of your condition as suffering versus struggling.\" She admitted.\n\n\"It's kind of like your theory on Magical Overuse.\" He said simply.\n\n\"You... read my theory?\" She asked in surprise. She had honestly forgotten that she had a copy of the thesis in her lab.\n\n\"It was attached to one of your unsent memos to the King about how James is becoming so strong so fast.\" He said, causing her face to flush. Those letters were meant only for the King. One being read by anyone else was an accident and completely her fault. \"And it very closely resembles the way muscle growth works.\" He said, completely unaware of the potential security breach he'd just brushed over.\n\n\"The idea that repeated magical exertion makes a mage stronger?\" She asked.\n\n\"Exactly.\" He said with another smile. \"I asked my therapist why she wanted me to learn about muscular hypertrophy and she asked me to ask JAMES about his first few times doing long distance runs. And also about how running was for him now that he did it for fun.\"\n\n\"Okay....\" She said uncertainly.\n\n\"James said they sucked. They sucked a lot at first. Hell, he said he thought he was gonna die after his first full marathon.\" Joey grinned. \"But he also said that after he'd recovered he felt like he could run laps around the world.\"\n\nVeliry nodded. She'd seen James AND Vickers go for runs, and according to Amina and Kela, both of them could run for days compared to most Petravians.\n\n\"He struggled.\" Joey said. \"Hell, he suffered. He showed me a picture of one of his toes after that first marathon. The nail on his big toe fell off after a few days.\"\n\nVeliry cringed.\n\n\"But.\" Joey continued. \"He pushed through the suffering and became stronger because of it. Maybe only at running, sure. But still. He saw a goal. He struggled and suffered until he could achieve it. And he came out the other side of it alive, and with a new hobby that he enjoyed.\" He smiled again. \"My therapist put it in those terms and suddenly I just... understood what I had to do to become WHO I want to be. Struggled my way through a difficult math class THREE TIMES. Because I knew that on the other side was the ability to become a Mechanical Engineer.\"\n\nSuddenly, everything about the two brothers started to make sense to her.\n\n\"Struggled my way through all the issues that my A.S.D. causes for me because I knew that someday I'd get where I needed to be. And that might not have been somewhere CONVENTIONALLY successful. But I knew that I'd know it when I got to it.\"\n\nThat made Veliry's thoughts crash to a halt.\n\n\"But.\" She began. \"Now you're here.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He said, still smiling.\n\n\"And you might never return.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"So you'll never be a mechanical engineer.\" She said. \"Or at least it's unlikely.\"\n\nJoey nodded a bit. \"And that sucks.\" He admitted. \"Makes me pissed that I DID fight my way through that class a bit. But I've also got my brother back. And,\" He held his hand up and his clothes began to flutter around him. He let go of a piece of parchment and it flew up until it touched the ceiling, then fluttered off to the side. \"I've got freaking magic. That's WAAAAAY cooler than being an engineer. And uses way less math.\" He looked back at her again. \"I may struggle a bit. I did those first few days for sure. I may even suffer a bit. James sure has since he got here.\" He said with a solemn look. \"But on the other side of that is a stronger me. Just like James has become stronger.\" He nodded his head a bit. \"He moves like an anime character. I can't wait to do that.\"\n\n*You two really are different aren't you?* She wondered as she watched him follow the piece of paper with his eyes.\n\n\"Now seriously.\" He said. \"I know we got sidetracked. Sorry about that. But seriously, why is my energy flow so different from anyone else?\"\n\n\"Oh, shit.\" She said. \"I completely forgot that was how we started this conversation.\" She admitted.\n\n\"It's okay.\" Joey reassured her. \"Like I said; I ramble.\"\n\n\\-----------------\n\n\"IS THAT IT?\" Vickers yelled through the rushing air as he and Amina flew. He pointed at the small gap between two of the mountains.\n\nShe looked over at where he'd been pointing and then looked back and nodded.\n\n\"THAT'S THE TOWN THAT THE ARMY DETACHMENT WAS DISPATCHED FROM!\" She confirmed, her throat and mouth glowing as she used her magic to amplify her speech. \"IF THE FOLLOW UP FORCE IS BEING MUSTERED, THAN THAT'S WHERE IT'LL BE!\"\n\nVickers nodded as they banked their griffins around the forested hill they'd been flying past. They'd been flying for three days now, having gone around and below the elevated desert where they knew the Earth Military had set up its outpost.\n\nIf there was one upside, one she was very happy about, it was the fact that Steve had regained some of his liveliness over the past few days. He still grumbled occasionally, but he was doing better.\n\nWhich meant that James was doing better. Wherever he was.\n\nShe lightly kicked her griffin, Ciaphas, to go faster.\n\nTom matched the speed easily.\n\nShe had a country to save, her country, from war.\n\n[\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/y7g7yg/wait_is_this_just_gate_243/)",

        "body": "I‚Äôm really glad to see some more of Joey‚Äôs POV.  As an autistic dude it‚Äôs pretty rare to see explicitly autistic characters who are more than a two-facet trope - usually the savant plus the social ineptitude - but Joey feels pretty convincing for the most part.\n\nAfter writing the entire rest of this comment, I realize this is kind of a lot to dump on a random internet stranger, and I dropped like four paragraphs on another commenter also, but I have strong feelings about the topic (hopefully understandably so) and I felt that I had to at least try.\n\nThe bodily autonomy things in his scene are a little weird, but given that he has a gigantic crush on our friend the Archmage I can see why he‚Äôd be ok with it.\n\nSomething that might help you writing Joey is that being autistic is fundamentally about ability to process stimuli.  A neurotypical person can ignore distractions without much effort, but for an autistic person those stimuli can be as central and viscerally experienced as the ‚Äúmain event‚Äù.  The one time when this is reduced is when the brain has latched onto a special interest - for whatever reason, it‚Äôs the one time that other stimuli can be ignored, so you don‚Äôt notice little stimuli until they reach a very strong state.  You don‚Äôt notice the little pangs of ‚Äúmaybe I could use a snack‚Äù until you‚Äôre so hungry it hurts, for example.\n\nI can share some personal experience to maybe try and clarify with other examples. Caveat,  every person will experience being autistic differently, but here goes.\n\nSmall sounds that for an NT person would just be part of the background can be clear as a bell and similarly jolting - clicking pens, rustling paper, feet tapping against the leg of a desk, all of these little noises can feel as loud as someone shouting, and feel just as distracting.  On a phone call with my folks, I had to ask them to say a sentence again because my suitemate next door started talking.  It wasn‚Äôt loud enough to actually drown anything out, it was generic background volume, but my brain decided that this addition was enough to make all incoming data become a jumbled mess.\n\nI can‚Äôt grow my facial hair out without incredible discomfort.  If you‚Äôve ever had an ingrown hair in your facial hair area, you know how it gets sensitive and you can‚Äôt *not* feel it.  Every single hair in my mustache area and to a lesser extent on my chin feels like that.  The hair on the back and especially the sides is the same way.  Most of the time I keep it very short, because when it exceeds about 3/4 inch or so it starts to get the same way as the facial hair.\n\nLooking at someone‚Äôs face directly, especially making eye contact, contains an absolute torrent of strong-feeling information that I can‚Äôt stand up to for very long.  I have some coping mechanisms that work ok, like looking at the bridge of someone‚Äôs nose instead of into their eyes properly, but it‚Äôs like trying to drink from a firehouse for me - I can‚Äôt do it for super long.\n\nI don‚Äôt have too many sensory stimuli issues, compared to some autistic folks I know, but uncomfortable scratchy clothing can be its own special kind of hell because I can‚Äôt ever get to the point of being able to ignore all the little prickles.\n\nI can‚Äôt eat tofu in anything other than miso soup because the shearing sensation against my teeth is impossible to ignore and is really really uncomfy.  I have similar issues with mushrooms, though not as bad.  I can deal with mushrooms when they‚Äôre chopped up really small, and I enjoy the flavour, but having me bite down on a slice of crimini is a big ask.  Eating a stuffed portobello is right out.",

        "body": "The muscle soreness you typically feel in your skeletal muscles (often called DOMS for Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) is the result of an inflammation and swelling response from muscle damage.  Although it can occur from any form of muscle damage from unaccustomed loading, it most often occurs from eccentric loading of muscles (meaning when the muscle is lengthening while creating force - think downward part of a bicep curl).  Eccentric actions generate greater forces (see force velocity curve [here](http://www.pt.ntu.edu.tw/hmchai/BM03/BMmaterial/Muscle.files/ForceVelocity.png)), and these higher forces cause weaker sarcomeres to \"pop.\"  [Sarcomeres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sarcomere.gif) are the small functional units that create force within a muscle cell and consist of all the proteins between two z-lines (thin dark lines in the picture).  [Here](http://jp.physoc.org/content/533/2/571/F3.large.jpg) you can see damaged sarcomeres where z-line streaming occurrs (small black lines are blown up).  When sarcomeres are disrupted, there is a loss of force production ability and a delayed rise in [inflammatory markers and more sensitized pain receptors](http://books.google.com/books?id=ueMh1x7kFjsC&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=nociceptors+in+doms&source=bl&ots=wxHcuuf2Qs&sig=XXdphntX3jZzIThugELzxGiRFBU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7iYSUJGvBaztiQKV2IBg&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=nociceptors%20in%20doms&f=false) (hence delayed soreness).\n\nThe heart doesn't ever operate at unaccustomed forces to cause damage, so even with a lifetime of beating you won't see damage the way you do in skeletal muscle and DOMS with unaccustomed loading.  Thus you won't see the soreness.  Others have pointed out the flaw in the lactate arguments for \"burning\" or fatigue.  [Lactate](http://i.imgur.com/Ptur5.jpg) is actually a great fuel source for the heart, and it in no way causes fatigue or soreness anywhere in the body.",

That means it has a LOT of mitchondria and it requires a continuous supply of oxygen to function.  So, to some extent it's a special kind of muscle (it's also wired differently to contract automatically but I don't know if that's relevant to the endurance).  \n\nMuscle soreness is primarily about overexertion, not just exertion.  If you build up gradually, exertion shouldn't hurt.  Your heart starts beating a while before it actually needs to do any work, and the load on it builds gradually.  \n\nYour other muscles get tired to tell you to conserve energy and to keep you from damaging them.

        "body": "Biomedical engineer here. Prepare to be educated. (or skip to the tl;dr)\n\n1) Yes, the heart is made from a very different form of muscle cells, called (wait for it) [Cardiac muscle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle).  These cells are structurally very different, and commonly have 2, 3, or 4 nuclei, a branched structure, and more rigid connections to other cardiac muscle cells. They also have way more mitochondria, allowing them to perform much longer without fatigue, with sufficient blood supply. Part of the reason that the heart is so resistant to fatigue is that it receives freshly oxygenated blood almost directly from the left ventricle, at high pressure unimpeded by the restrictive paths of the circulatory system.\n\n2) The phenomenon of extreme \"fight or flight\" performance (people lifting cars off babies) is attributed to adrenalin surge, which affects all muscles, not just cardiac performance. Adrenalin enhances muscular performance, activation speed, and motor unit recruitment, tweaks the nerves (both sensory and motor control) for greater sensitivity, and prioritizes blood flow by causing non-critical systems (like digestion and sexual response) to temporarily constrict their blood vessels.\n\nHowever, the body cannot remain in this state for very long. These changes need to be reversed (\"Rest-and-digest\"), and eventually re-balanced. The fight-or-flight response is not binary, either. The body's response to stress is proportional to its perceived threat to our well-being, and the speed at which it was encountered. If you see a car coming a long way away, it doesn't scare you as much as a car that zooms past you from behind. People who live high-stress lifestyles and cope poorly (constantly in fight-or-flight with not enough chance to rest their body) suffer from constipation, anorexia, sexual dysfunction and suppression of the immune system.\n\n3) You mentioned \"Lactic acid\". Normally, about 35% of the heart's energy is metabolized from glucose, which forms [Lactate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_cycle). Unlike skeletal muscles, which depend on the liver to metabolize the lactate back into glucose, cardiac muscle can recycle the lactate, diminishing the effects of fatigue. Again, this is an unsustainable process, and can only be maintained temporarily.\n\n4) The performance of cardiac muscle is strongly related to the regular frequency and timing of contractions (squeeze, rest, squeeze, rest). The parasympathetic nervous system can adjust these contractions very little; sustained contractions  are impossible, as are prolonged periods without contraction, or varied recruitment of muscle fibers, which would change the force of the contraction. Even the most subtle changes in the heartbeat can result in huge changes in the body's performance, and sometimes even heart failure.\n\nSkeletal muscle, on the other hand, is highly voluntary. The nature of the signals from the central nervous system allows for proportional control of motor unit recruitment, as well as prolonged contractions. The various forms of skeletal muscle (fast twitch, slow twitch, etc) give us a wide range of capability, and the co-development of muscle groups allow for simplified control of coordinated movements. This simply is not possible with cardiac muscle, as the cells are wired to fire in a very specific sequence, like the detonation of explosions in rock blasting. When you compare [rock blasting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BzUph9HvZk&feature=player_detailpage#t=5s) to [cardiac contraction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3b-YhZmQu8&feature=player_detailpage#t=52s), you'll notice that both have a distinct point of initiation, and the wave of output follows from there. In both examples, once the sequence is started, it cannot be stopped, sped up, or slowed down. \n\nSo, to answer your question. It is a HUGE evolutionary benefit to animals (not just humans) to have SOME muscles that are highly resistant to fatigue. The complex structure of the 4-chambered human heart and its complimentary circulatory system is one of the main reasons our ancestors were so good at [persistence hunting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o&feature=related). (I highly recommend you watch that entire video).\n\nHowever, these muscles demand extremely consistent blood flow, and high perfusion rates, which requires high blood pressure. Their metabolic demand is much higher, and they cannot be controlled in such a way that would give us the dexterity, agility, or strength that allows us to perform the complex tasks that our daily lives demand. Therefore, it is necessary to have evolved different types of muscle, with characteristics tuned specifically for their role in our daily lives.\n\n**tl;dr: The heart muscle and skeletal muscles have different functions with different requirements.**\n\nEDIT: Holy shit, man. Dexadrine is a crazy powerful drug. It's a good thing I don't have to work today... OH SHIT!",

        "body": "There are three types of muscle in your body: smooth, cardiac, and skeletal.  Cardiac is \"wired\" differently from skeletal muscle in that it can propagate an electric signal whereas skeletal muscle must be activated via  nervous system activity.  This partially explains why a heart can continue beating after it is removed from the body.  I don't think it explains the lack of pain.\n\nFundamentally what causes your soreness after exercise is called Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness).  As others have said, we're not positive about a lot of the mechanisms, but the skeletal muscle is definitely being damaged as muscle proteins start showing up in the bloodstream after intensive eccentric contraction exercises.  After that, your body reacts with inflammation, repair activities, and the corresponding activation of pain sensing receptors.\n\nSomething similar happens in cases of the heart being subjected to requirements far beyond what it is acclimated to.  Sometimes poorly trained marathoners are able to physically push their skeletal muscle further than what their hearts would prefer to do, and the results bear some resemblence to a heart attack.  Some of the same enzymes (Troponin I and Troponin T) show up and the heart actually shows signs of performing worse due to \"overuse.\"  This shows up as reduced contractile strength for up to a month.\n\nSo, something similar is happening and it may very well cause pain.  The important thing to keep in mind is that this is when the heart is pushed to its absolute limits.  This is relevant to your last point, several folks believe in the \"Central Governor Theory\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_governor) which proposes that the brain instructs us to quit when life-threatening damage is imminent as sort of \"fuse\" for self-protection.",

    "body": "This post is the culmination of over a decade of research, testing, and persistence in advancing KP treatments and our understanding of this condition. Like so many of you, I have met with countless dermatologists across the country and sunk significant money into trying to effectively treat this condition. I wholeheartedly believe that this theory and the treatments I have proposed are the most effective and up to date options for reducing the severity of Keratosis Pilaris.¬†\n\nKeratosis Pilaris is not caused by keratin buildup in the skin. Keratin buildup around the follicle is one of the last symptoms to develop in a series of cascading symptoms.\n\nHi everyone- my name is Devin Beaubien ([u/Poem\\_KP](https://www.reddit.com/user/Poem_KP/)) and I moderate the [r/keratosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/) subreddit.¬†\n\nI've been researching Keratosis Pilaris and trying to understand what the condition is, why I have it, and how I could improve my situation for well over a decade. I've been pushing harder than ever on this research since my son developed KP as a toddler that was much more severe than mine was at the same age. In these past 5 years I believe I‚Äôve discovered and developed a highly effective treatment to target the underlying barrier defects and inflammation/redness of KP. This was done through extensive testing and research, first by myself in a home-based lab, and then through partnering with a commercial R&D lab that helped me to formalize what I had developed.¬†\n\nThis post will attempt to summarize my proposal on the pathology of KP, treatment options, and why KP is such a misunderstood skin condition. At the time of posting, I believe that this KP theory is the most comprehensive research article ever compiled on Keratosis Pilaris.¬†\n\nIn the simplest terms, Keratosis Pilaris is a very common skin condition that begins with a single underlying root cause. That root cause is located in the epithelial skin barrier around the hair follicle where the barrier has cellular ‚Äúgaps‚Äù (for lack of a better term) that allow moisture to escape and bacteria and allergens to pass into the skin, triggering an immune response. This barrier abnormality occurs well before keratin begins forming in the follicle.¬†\n\nThere are multiple KP symptoms that build on top of one another. From my research they follow this pattern:\n\n1. Skin cells fail to secrete lipids during maturation\n2. Skin barrier around the follicle is compromised\n3. Inflammation develops\n4. Sebaceous glands shrink and atrophy\n5. Hair follicles become brittle and curled\n6. Keratin accumulates in the follicle (creating the bumps)\n7. When inflammation recedes from the follicle it leaves behind post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\nNearly all treatments for KP are attempting to improve the texture of KP by chemically exfoliating the keratin buildup in the follicle, but since they do not adequately address all of the barrier issues or sebaceous gland shrinkage that develop prior to this symptom, the best results that you can expect to achieve are going to be texture improvements. Applying glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, and/or retinol to a compromised skin barrier is not going to do much for improving redness and inflammation. In fact it may very well do the opposite.¬†\n\nWhile moisturizing the skin will help soften and reduce some dryness around the follicles, it‚Äôs a losing battle if your skin is not producing enough sebum (skin oil) to moisturize and protect your follicles.¬†\n\nThis next part is going to be complicated and represents the bulk of my research on KP. What I cover here is delved into with much more depth in the article I linked at the beginning (and end) of this post.¬†\n\nI theorize that the barrier issues we see in KP are the direct result of deficient IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1) levels in skin tissue, combined with genetic mutations of Insulin growth factor receptors and the underlying cellular signaling pathways that regulate how skin cells mature and differentiate as they move through the layers of the skin.¬†\n\nConsider the following:¬†\n\n* Studies testing IGF-1 inhibition result in a disrupted epidermis that looks strikingly like the barrier disruption seen in KP: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/) & [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/)\n* IGF-1 and its effects on skin cells directly regulate skin cell maturation as the cells travel through the skin. Deficiency in IGF-1 and/or mutations in Insulin receptors would directly affect the skin cell as it differentiates and secretes lipids during the formation of the skin barrier around the SC-SG interface, which is exactly where we see barrier issues appearing in KP. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/) & [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/)\n* This study identified mutation of cellular pathways (triggered by IGF-1) resulting in the development of KP: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/)\n* IGF-1 levels are lowest in children and steadily increase as you age into adulthood, correlating with how we see KP improve in some children as they age or \"grow out of their KP\": [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451965018300334](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451965018300334)\n* IGF-1 levels raise while we sleep, with sleep being crucial to hormone production. This correlates with people reporting that their KP appears less severe in the mornings upon waking. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160412/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160412/)\n* IGF-1 levels decrease and sebaceous glands are atrophied when undergoing Isotretinoin (Accutane) treatment. This correlates with the numerous reports we‚Äôve seen in [r/keratosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/) of people experiencing increased severity of KP after taking Accutane.¬†[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128787/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128787/)\n* IGF-1 levels are affected by pregnancy during increased estrogen production and additional hormonal factors. This correlates with reports of KP severity changes during and post pregnancy. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17492948/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17492948/)\n* PCOS and other conditions that affect insulin resistance also correlate with increased likelihood of KP development. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22374641/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22374641/)\n* Diets that contain high glycemic foods (rapidly digested carbohydrates) and milk proteins can effect insulin resistance, providing a potential link for some between diet and KP that so often is reported in [r/keratosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/)\n* Keratosis pilaris can result from Dupilumab for the treatment of bronchial asthma. IGF-2 stimulates the secretion of the Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 by 40-70%, while Dupilumab has been shown to inhibit the Th2 pathway. This reinforces the assertion that mutations in this cellular pathway and its signaling are direct causes in the pathology of KP: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cia2.12172](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cia2.12172)\n* KP prevalence correlates with obesity, which in turn correlates with insulin resistance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30043128/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30043128/)\n* IGF-1 is also responsible for the regulation of lipogenesis, which is thought to occur through IGF-1‚Äôs effects on 5Œ±-Reductase and the enzymatic process responsible for converting testosterone into DHT, which stimulates sebocyte proliferation. IGF-1 effective regulates sebum production in the skin. [https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/133/2/447/3035051](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/133/2/447/3035051)\n\nI could continue but at this point I think you are probably seeing the same patterns I see.¬†\n\nIGF-1 is also responsible for inhibiting inflammation via stimulation of IL-10 production which I believe is very crucial for people suffering from KPRF, a subtype of KP affecting the face with visible redness and flushing of the cheeks.¬†( [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277570/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277570/) )\n\nSo to summarize, IGF-1 and its related cellular pathways are connected directly or is one step removed from every symptom experienced by those with KP. Deficiency in IGF-1 and IR mutation also correlates with all of the events that are known to affect KP development and severity.¬†\n\nSo the big question is how do we improve IGF-1 bioavailability in skin tissue to prevent barrier issues from forming, thereby preventing KP symptoms?\n\nFor this, I believe I have a very compelling answer.¬†\n\nHere is my arm with severe KP before and after applying this treatment for stimulating IGF-1 production in my skin through a topical lotion I developed:\n\n[My arm after 12 weeks of continued twice daily application of topical RK & Indirubin](https://preview.redd.it/hcka88bcwdme1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9107f018d87f5a5aef81cbd0d028ddfdebe54a5)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/how-we-can-improve-keratosis-pilaris-treatment-v0-3qo9em8anwle1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e9d591e2ac6952b607bbe4dae09b0b9677a6b9e)\n\nInitially in my research I was testing multiple compounds on my skin to determine their effectiveness on my KP. I finally settled on two specific compounds:\n\n**Raspberry Ketone:** The aromatic compound in red raspberries has been studied for topical application and has been shown to stimulate significant IGF-1 production in skin tissue through sensory neuron activation. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18321745/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18321745/)\n\n**Indirubin (Indigo Naturalis):** An anti inflammatory that reduces keratinocyte proliferation and cytokine production in the skin.¬†[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838180/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838180/)\n\nBy combining these ingredients into a jojoba oil base (which is a plant extracted oil that is¬†chemically similar to human sebum) I believe I have created the most effective skincare topical for regulating Keratosis Pilaris. This topical solution was also iterated on to balance pH and add the lowest effective concentration of lactic acid to help turn over skin cells without irritation, reducing pigmentation that has occurred due to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\n\nI have written about this extensively on my website/blog, initially I tried to copy over the entire article but there is a 40,000 character limit and I know that linking your own site or blog post is against community guidelines, but if you find this theory interesting or want to see more evidence, feel free to DM me or head over to r/keratosis where I've shared more info. \n\nI really believe that we can approach KP skincare through a different lens.

Two or three bottles should be enough of this stuff, it expires quick so go put it in the fridge asap. dont worry though, you wont be out for too long, chances are your city already changed their mandated curfew without any warning like two minutes ago to 30 minutes from now so you'll be home soon or dead.\n4. next stop? belif. why? did they do something problematic? probably. but that's not why you're there. they discontinued their chamomile cleansing stick because apparently cleansing sticks were just a fad even though i really enjoyed them and someone has to pay for it. get yourself some aqua bomb if you oily and moisturizing balm if you dry\n5. grab like 10 lineage lip sleeping masks, these come in many different flavors. grab as many as you can. this is how we're gonna get you that perfect pout for your mug shot! \n6. i know it's not fun to go looting and having to follow a list so here's your chance to go wild. grab whatever moisturizers you want to try out. go for unscented if you can because scents have the highest chance of being irritating and also serve no purpose in products they're high risk no reward (the DE line is unscented i think and so is clinique). \n7. what about eyecreams and hydrating toners and essences... those are all scams it turns out. putting moisturizer everywhere and on a wet face achieves the same thing.\n8. I know what you're thinking, should I grab some sunscreen I got lots of acids that'll thin out my skin, shouldnt i protect it? OH HONEY chances are that you won't live long enough to see the harmful side effects of wearing acids and going in the sun but it never hurts to be careful. get as much sunscreen as you can with the remaining room you've got. \n\nalright sisters that's enough reading now lets get to rioting time to get that lit from within glow like the third precinct in minneapolis.",

The ringing in her ears sounded strange, like the air was thicker than it should have been. Her suit seemed to protect her from grievous harm, but her limbs felt sore and yelled at her each time she moved them. As the world came into focus, the sound slowly faded.\n\nSlowly, swearing under her breath the entire time, she attempted to stand. She was almost successful, until her right foot-paw screamed loudly in pain. She stumbled, and leaned against a nearby tree, slowly sliding down. She looked around, trying to find anything other than a damn tree.\n\nThe wreckage of the ship wasn‚Äôt anywhere to be seen. Just large, thick-trunked trees that didn‚Äôt look like trees she was used to. The bark was smooth, with thick, green vines that wound around the trunk like a helix.\n\nThe suit beeped as a HUD appeared on screen. The atmosphere was breathable; some higher-than-average concentrations of nothing that would hurt. She took off her helmet. Nothing felt better than the feeling of air on her fur. Sure the suit kept her alive, but was it worth it?\n\nHer ears twitched as the underbrush started to move on her right. She had just put her hand-paw on her belt knife when a voice came from the same direction.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs just me!‚Äù\n\nHer hand-paw didn‚Äôt leave the knife as the Human walked out of the trees. His suit was burnt, just as damaged as hers was. He apparently survived the descent without injury. Unfortunate.\n\nHe stopped walking when he saw where her hand-paw was. ‚ÄúLook, I understand that you might be slightly mad-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou pushed me out of a falling ship.‚Äù It took a great effort to sound calm despite how angry she felt.\n\nThe human moved his shoulders in a gesture of uncertainty. ‚ÄúIf I remember correctly I *pulled* you from the ship. Which, *really*, means I put myself in more danger-‚Äù The human took a step back from her, no doubt because of the low growl that was suddenly filling the air. He composed himself and took a step closer to her. ‚ÄúAlright, put a pin in that. Right now it‚Äôd be best if we find the wreckage of the ship. It would be best if we knew who else was on this world and what supplies we can salvage.‚Äù He walked to her and extended a hand.\n\nShe didn‚Äôt have much experience with Humans. No one did. They all but vanished after the war with the Kotqic. They became famous for surviving for so long on a death world, fought their way through their first galactic war, and then vanished as quickly as they had become famous. Stories were told about them: they were savage, they were kind, they could read minds, they could run forever, they were extinct, they were everywhere, there was only one left and their name was Jack. They were all manner of things.\n\nShe was pragmatic. She knew the cost of accepting an injured being when the situation was survival. Either the human was going to kill her with his other hand, or he was saving her tender, tender meat for later. She couldn‚Äôt even begin to wonder what was more likely. Half the universe would say the former, the other half would say the later.\n\nApparently she had been contemplating longer than she thought. He sighed, and pulled back his hand. He crouched down in front of her, bringing his face level with hers. ‚ÄúLook, I know how to ensure that you won‚Äôt walk with a limp for the rest of your life, however short that may be. I‚Äôve had training for these situations. I can‚Äôt promise that we‚Äôll make it off this world, but I can promise that we‚Äôll survive. Please let me help.‚Äù\n\nHe offered the hand again.\n\nShe stared at it.\n\n---\n\n‚ÄúHow are you doing back there?‚Äù\n\nShe almost growled. ‚ÄúYour back was not designed for comfort.‚Äù\n\nHe laughed. ‚ÄúSorry, the deluxe package was outside my price range. I could use the air conditioning right now though.‚Äù The sound of the human‚Äôs steady walking was the only sound for a while. ‚ÄúThat was a joke.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh.‚Äù\n\nShe felt his chest move as the human breathed quickly; a quiet laugh. ‚ÄúI keep saying that we need to at least *tell* other races about our biology.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSpeaking of which, do you need to rest soon? You‚Äôve been walking for almost 25 minutes. And you are starting to leak.‚Äù\n\nThe quiet laugh moved his chest again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sweat. It cools my body as it evaporates. And thank you for the concern, but I‚Äôm good. I can go for a while yet.‚Äù\n\nAs much as she wanted to hear more about the mysterious Humans, she couldn‚Äôt focus on what he was saying. The sounds behind them were getting louder. It sounded like the earth was shattering. Trees were being bent or crushed. It had been staying the same volume, meaning whatever was crashing through the forest was staying away. But the volume had started to grow steadily and dangerously louder.\n\nShe gripped the human‚Äôs shoulders, mindful of her claws. ‚ÄúThere is something coming this way. Something large and powerful.‚Äù\n\nThe human slowed and turned to look where they had come. ‚ÄúYea, I thought I heard something. If you had to guess, how dangerous?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt has been destroying trees.‚Äù\n\nHe looked up the nearest tree. It was easily 40 meters high. It also wasn‚Äôt the highest tree by any measure.\n\nThe human‚Äôs head quickly turned to the noise. ‚ÄúOh, now I hear it.‚Äù He pulled a small but thick tablet off his belt.\n\n‚ÄúCodex, wake up.‚Äù\n\nThe small rectangle floated off his palm, reshaping into a small ball with a single blue light functioning as an eye. A robotic and vaguely feminine voice said, ‚ÄúCodex active.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSound analysis and make it quick. Something‚Äôs coming after us, sounds like a pack of [elephants]‚Äù\n\nThe light from the drone turned to the sound.\n\nShe gently squeezed his shoulder. ‚ÄúYou have beasts like that strong on your world?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre strong enough to knock down these trees. They‚Äôre massive mammals that can pick up a good bit of speed. Inertia makes them fairly deadly.‚Äù\n\nShe opened her mouth to speak, but the drone cut her off. ‚ÄúAnalysis complete. Creature is approximately twice the size of an Earth [elephant]. Current speed is [40 km\\h] and accelerating. Recommendation-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYea, I got the idea. Give me three stims and goodnight codex.‚Äù\n\nA small opening dropped three very short injectors into the human‚Äôs hand. She was stunned. Stimpacks, or stims, were mixtures of adrenaline and race-specific hormones that allowed soldiers, addicts, and students to hit a kind of ‚Äòcombat high‚Äô. The effects were generally the same: it gave you extreme energy, with an extreme crash.\n\n‚ÄúYou use stims?‚Äù\n\nShe could see his mouth curled into an unpleasant grimace, like he had just seen a corpse. ‚ÄúOnly under very special circumstances. Like when I‚Äôve been carrying a Taxtil for the last half-hour without a break and now I need to sprint like a cheating husband.‚Äù He patted one of her hands for some reason. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, this doesn‚Äôt have much adrenaline. I‚Äôll have Codex explain later.‚Äù\n\nHe put two stims in a pocket, and held the third in his hand He exhaled a breath and started to shake his legs, one after the other. He bent at odd angles, bouncing against his muscles. ‚ÄúAhh I‚Äôm going to hate this *so much*.‚Äù\n\nHe slammed the tip of the injector against his thigh. She held on tighter, expecting the shake that said the adrenaline wracked his system.\n\nWhat came next wasn‚Äôt the full-body jolt that she was expecting. Instead, he started to run. It wasn‚Äôt nearly as fast as she could run, but she hadn‚Äôt ever had to run after walking for as long as he had. He was attempting to put some distance between whatever was following them. He couldn‚Äôt move fast enough to outpace the creature, but they would last a little longer than just walking.\n\nAnd then the air exploded.\n\nThe noise was like a Bal [Thunderhorn], if the [mouthpiece] was put next to a tornado that was experimenting on [a kind of shrieking fungus]. Her ears flattened out of reflex, but it was loud enough to shake the air and crack trees. She felt for the human; his hands couldn‚Äôt cover his simple ears because he was holding her legs next to his waist. Since he was running on the adrenaline from a stim, he probably barely felt the creature‚Äôs roar.\n\n‚ÄúOW! Fuck me sideways that hurt!‚Äù\n\nIf she wasn‚Äôt more concerned with holding on for dear life, she would have been surprised. He had a full stim, how could he feel *anything*? She had seen stimmed soldiers take energy blasts and lose limbs and keep charging like nothing had happened.\n\nThe sound like a series of bombs going off behind them got louder. \n\n‚ÄúCodex!‚Äù the human yelled, with no prompting. The drone released itself from his waist and floated along beside them. \n\n‚ÄúYes?‚Äù\n\nThe command slammed out over a single breath. ‚ÄúWe need to hide find something quick!‚Äù \n\nThe drone floated above their heads and spun it‚Äôs eye around them as the human ran. \n\nShe felt useless. But what could she do with an injured foot? She tried looking around for someplace, but the human‚Äôs running was making it difficult to see past the trees. Hopefully the drone would be able to locate something.\n\nThe human didn‚Äôt seem that patient. Between panted breaths he shouted ‚Äú**CODEDX SERIOUSLY!**‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFound: one hundred meters left, there is what looks like an abandoned ship.‚Äù\n\nThe human didn‚Äôt even stop running. He just sharply turned his body, absorbed the force through his knees, and took off in the new direction. She would have lost her grip if he hadn‚Äôt been holding onto her legs tightly.\n\nThe ship wasn‚Äôt that far into the forest. She couldn‚Äôt tell who it had once belonged to, but the growth of plants around and into the ship said that the owners wouldn‚Äôt mind if they took shelter. \n\nThe human, moving noticeably slower, stumbled in through an opening, and gently sat her down in the ship‚Äôs carcass. He sat down, quietly, across from her, eyes closed and panting. The drone was floating in the air next to him.\n\nThe thundering sound, much quieter now, slowly trailed off into the distance.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs leaving. We‚Äôre safe for now.‚Äù\n\nThe human sighed, or at least took a larger breath. Even though he had just ran much further in one burst than any warrior or trained specialist she had ever seen or heard of, it seemed that even humans had limits when it came to endurance.\n\n‚ÄúCo-‚Äù He stopped, breathing heavily and slowly sliding down the wall to lie on the floor. ‚ÄúHoly fuck I‚Äôm so tired... Codex, medical scan and treatment.‚Äù\n\nThe drone beeped. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre extremely-‚Äù\n\nOne of the human‚Äôs hands swatted at the drone, coming nowhere close to hitting the thing. ‚ÄúNot me, I know what‚Äôs wrong with me! I meant *her*, wingdings!‚Äù\n\nThe drone bobbed in the air at the order/insult and floated to her. ‚ÄúMay I have permission to scan you for medical issues?‚Äù\n\nShe nodded, half paying attention to the floating orb as it scanned her body. ‚ÄúAre you going to be okay?‚Äù\n\nThe human laughed, but her question wasn‚Äôt meant as a joke. She opened her mouth, but the human answered first. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be okay. I just need to not move for about 12 hours.‚Äù He wetted his lips. ‚ÄúOur muscles build up lactic acid as they are used. It makes them sore and harder to move. Basically, it‚Äôs our body telling us when it‚Äôs time to ease up. That stim was a compound to flush all that lactic acid out of my muscles.‚Äù\n\nHe sighed through his exposed teeth. ‚ÄúSo now all my muscles are building up more lactic acid. Which means it‚Äôs going to hurt to move for a while. I‚Äôll survive.‚Äù\n\nAs the drone focused it‚Äôs eye/screen on her injured ankle, she cocked her head to the side. ‚ÄúYou mean there wasn‚Äôt adrenaline in that stim?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs some, but not that much.‚Äù He closed his eyes for a second. ‚ÄúWell, not much for a human. I think there‚Äôs about... a third of a standard unit? A little less, I think?‚Äù\n\nThat sounded about right. Most stims were about two units. They were more than enough to last for whatever purpose they needed. A third of a unit really wasn‚Äôt that much.\n\nThe human, eyes closed and breathing just approaching his regular pace, chuckled softly. ‚ÄúNot that I felt it with all the adrenaline already in my system.‚Äù\n\nThe drone snapped it‚Äôs eye to the prone human. ‚ÄúJack, you have been warned about-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry Codex. Just scan her, please.‚Äù\n\nShe would have called the look that the drone gave the human accusatory, before it resumed its task.\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that? Were you already taking stims?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, our bodies-,‚Äù Wincing, he pointed a finger at the drone just as it turned back to the human. ‚ÄúShut up Codex, she‚Äôs going to find out one way or another.‚Äù They had a short stare-down, before the drone listened to its owner. \n\n‚ÄúAs I was saying, our bodies produce adrenaline when we‚Äôre stressed. It‚Äôs an old evolutionary thing that never really went away. I was already flooded with adrenaline before I took the stim.‚Äù\n\nShe wasn‚Äôt sure how to process that. Adrenaline was such a powerful compound, worth enough to make certain drug dealers quite rich, and the humans generated it naturally? How had they not become warriors, endlessly running across the universe, conquering whatever they laid their eyes on?\n\nHer musings were interrupted by the small drone. ‚ÄúScan complete. You have a sprained ankle.‚Äù\n\nShe glared at the human, thoughts of adrenaline temporarily swept to the side. It was less intense since he just saved their lives, but it was still certainly a glare. ‚ÄúI must have hit something on the way out of the ship. After you caused me to leave a ship in outer atmo.‚Äù\n\nThe human, now laying down in what used to be a hallway, looked at her without expression. ‚ÄúCodex, do you have... oh damn, what was it called...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI have the materials needed to fully heal the injury.‚Äù The Codex turned to her before it‚Äôs owner gave the order. ‚ÄúWill you permit me to administer the treatment? It is an injection consisting of half a standard unit of nanites. They will repair the damage and then disintegrate harmlessly.‚Äù\n\nShe nodded, more concerned with trying to figure out the human. ‚ÄúYou warned me about the pirates. You pushed me out of a ship. You carried me when I was injured, and put your life in danger to rescue me. And now you use valuable materials to heal me. Why?‚Äù\n\nThe human shrugged, wincing through the entire motion. He was silent for a while. She let him think about what he wanted to say. Finally, he quietly said, ‚ÄúI think the answer is more complex than you‚Äôd think.‚Äù\n\nThe dead ship was quiet, only disrupted by the sound of an injector beginning her treatment. The Codex, ignoring the slightly chilly tone of the ship, calmly told her not to move for about an hour.\n\nSilence reigned.\n\nThe Human, paralyzed by his own body, laid on the metal floor, staring at the ceiling.\n\nThe Taxtil, calmly waiting for her ankle to be healed, started at the human.\n\nThe Codex hovered in the air, looking between the two.\n\n‚ÄúHuman, may I ask you a question?‚Äù\n\nHe blinked and slightly turned his head. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe might be trapped on this planet for quite a while. I normally do not care for referring to others simply by their species. You may call me Dawn. What is your name?‚Äù\n\nA single burst of laughter wracked his body, quickly replaced by a pained groan. ‚ÄúOh, laughing hurts, oh, this is truly hell. Sorry, I just didn‚Äôt think *that* was what you were going to ask.‚Äù\n\nHe smiled. She almost smiled back: apparently that was a gesture they had in common.\n\n‚ÄúMy name is Jack.‚Äù\n\n---\n\nFirst post after weeks of meticulous lurking.

It's most likely the injury that the muscle sustains during the activity. Lactic acid is a product of pyruvate in the glycolitic cycle that we go through when we sprint or do strenuous but quick stuff. Lactic acid then goes off into another cycle to produce more energy for stuff. It's really her nor there but I've spent a lot of classroom time learning this and it's fun to teach others about how the human body works!\n\nAnyways, I really did enjoy your story!",

    "body": "A few months ago, the civil township of Wainley (NC) was officially revoked. The area‚Äôs had a dwindling population for decades, and with less than a dozen people living there as of this writing, the town has been absorbed into a neighboring area.\n\nFor most people, this is a footnote. No one really knew about Wainley. Hell, even the post office got confused at times. But that town used to be something, and the people who came from there are as real as it gets.\n\nI was one of those people, and I want to tell the story of what happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the 90‚Äôs, Wainley was the home to approximately 3800 people. The main export was corrugated steel roofing sheets produced by the Wainley Metalworking Roofing & Tiles. There were the two dairy farms, the Ansens and the Bowes. We also had a small barley and wheat refinery, a high school, two large off-site admin offices, and one of those small-scale business incubators. Apart from that, there wasn‚Äôt much to see in Wainley. Just this flat chunk of land amid a big pile of nothing.\n\nIn those days, people were already leaving town. Businesses were split between Fayetteville and Roseboro. A lot of people figured that there was no point making big investment plans for a town that was bleeding out. Hell, even Wainley Metalworking considered relocating south, to Wilmington, abandoning their namesake.\n\nBut despite all that sour gloom, it wasn‚Äôt industry decisions that caused the downfall of Wainley.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was 13 years old in 1993. I grew up with my mom Ranielle (Rani for short), and my dad Morgan. My little brother Amos had the room right across the hall. He was just 10 years old at the time.\n\nIt was the last month of middle school. The following autumn, I was supposed to study at Wainley High. But for all of primary school, we had to take a bus out of town. Took us about 25 minutes, one-way. Not too bad, but it singled us out. Us Wainley kids were a unit at that point, arriving and leaving in unison.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a Friday afternoon in late May. I was on the school bus, on my way back home. There were these two kids in front of me who couldn‚Äôt stop talking about their latest Super Nintendo game. Star Fox, I think. I‚Äôd zoned out their entire conversation, instead opting to stare out the window.\n\nWhen we got to the Wainley town sign, I noticed something strange. There was a man from the sheriff‚Äôs office, using a roller to add something to the sign. All I saw was the word ‚ÄúNO‚Äù.\n\nThere were several police vehicles blocking the road into town. I recognized the faces of the officers, but I hadn‚Äôt talked to them before. There weren‚Äôt a lot of criminals in Wainley, and my family were all on the straight and narrow. Even my dad, who joked about being a bank robber. He wasn‚Äôt. He was a corporate lawyer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bus stopped, and so did the conversation. No more Star Fox. The double doors at the front of the bus whooshed open, and an older policeman stepped on board with his hands on his walkie-talkie. He looked at the driver and nodded, then turned to us.\n\n‚ÄúHey there, kids,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm officer Gellen. We‚Äôre not going to keep you here too long, we just need to have a little talk, if that‚Äôs okay. Is that okay, kids?‚Äù\n\nThere was a muttering ‚Äúyes‚Äù coming from the Wainley middle school children. Myself included. Officer Gellen nodded, hiding a wide smile under a wild moustache.\n\n‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll be right back. Sir, would you accompany me outside for a sec?‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe driver stepped outside with officer Gellen. Meanwhile, the rest of us kept looking around, trying to see what was wrong.\n\n‚ÄúMaybe there‚Äôs an accident,‚Äù said one of the younger kids. ‚ÄúMaybe someone got hurt.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a fire,‚Äù said another. ‚ÄúMom says we can‚Äôt barbecue because of fire hazard.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMaybe there‚Äôs a murderer!‚Äù said the Star Fox kid. ‚ÄúAnd they found like heads and stuff!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGross,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gross.‚Äù\n\nI looked back outside as the other kids started to squabble. It went from fire, to accident, to murderers, to space aliens ‚Äì then right back to talking Star Fox. Meanwhile, I stared off in the distance. And that, in turn, gave me an idea. I could see the back of the town sign from the rear window.\n\nI leaned back and looked out. The sign read ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre now leaving Wainley!‚Äô, but there was a large white text added to it.\n\n*‚ÄúNO MILK‚Äù*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I got the chance to tell the other kids, officer Gellen came back on board. The driver got back in his seat.\n\n‚ÄúI had a very productive talk with mister Harley here, and he tells me that I‚Äôve stumbled upon a particularly crafty and well-behaved group of students. Is he right about that? Is that what you are?‚Äù\n\nOf course we were. In unison, we agreed with officer Gellen.\n\n‚ÄúWell, in that case, you might be able to help me out. See, we‚Äôre looking for a special something that we can‚Äôt bring into town, or people might get sick. And we wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to get sick now, would we?‚Äù\n\nOf course not.\n\n‚ÄúThen I hope you won‚Äôt mind some of my officers checking your backpacks, to make sure nothing bad snuck along, would you?‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo officers stepped on board as Gellen hurried outside to halt an approaching sedan. Someone was trying to get out of town, but was turned away. One by one, the officers had a short talk with us and went through our backpacks. Our lunches, specifically.\n\nWhen they got to the Star Fox kid, just ahead of me, I heard them asking him a series of questions. What he‚Äôd been eating, how long ago, if he‚Äôd gone to the bathroom since. Strange questions. Turns out he had chocolate milk as part of his lunch. The officer who asked clicked his walkie-talkie twice; some sort of discrete signal.\n\nWhen they got to me, I handed them my backpack.\n\n‚ÄúHave you had anything to drink today?‚Äù he asked.\n\n‚ÄúMy mom made lemonade,‚Äù I said.\n\n‚ÄúThat sounds great. Wish my mom made me some,‚Äù he smiled. ‚ÄúAnything to eat? Any cheese? Any milk?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJust fish sticks and rice,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd ketchup.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt sound too bad.‚Äù\n\nHe rummaged through the backpack and seemed relieved not to find what he was looking for.\n\n‚ÄúAlright, looks like we‚Äôre done. You have a good weekend now.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou too.‚Äù\n\nOnce they‚Äôd gone through every backpack, they circled back to the Star Fox kid. They asked him to come along, and said they had to ask a couple more questions. It was scary. He started crying, and they tried to encourage him every step of the way. They said they were gonna call his parents, and everything was gonna be fine.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt so sure.\n\nOnce the bus started rolling, I looked back to see officer Gellen in the rear window. He wasn‚Äôt smiling anymore. He had this grim look on his face, staring straight into the asphalt, motionless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a long line of cars being turned away. Some cars I recognized. Friend and neighbors looking to make a quick exit. The bus had to pull to the side at one point to let a fire truck pass. I got the impression that something big had happened, but no one was telling me what it was. The conversation had died down, and I had to fill the silence with my worries. There was no chatter to distract me.\n\nBy the time we got to the bus stop, I saw all our parents lined up. My mom and dad included. Amos was also there; he‚Äôd taken an earlier bus and had been home since lunch.\n\nAs I stepped off, my dad swept me up in his arms. Mom was crying.\n\n‚ÄúWhat did they do?‚Äù dad asked. ‚ÄúDid they take anything? What did they ask you?‚Äù\n\nMom took me from him,\n\n‚ÄúGive it a rest, Morgan,‚Äù she spat. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home.‚Äù\n\nAmos seemed disinterested, instead clutching a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic that they‚Äôd bribed him with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a man in camouflage with an assault rifle walking up and down the street, asking people to disperse and return to their homes. Mom and dad hurried back to the car, sticking me and Amos in the back. He went straight to reading his comic book, but I kept looking out the window. As we got back on the road, heading home, I noticed several strange signs. The most prominent one was on the window of a corner shop.\n\n*‚ÄúNO MILK, BY ORDER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD.‚Äù*\n\nWhen we took the road by the Bowes dairy farm, I heard popping noises. Before I got the chance to ask, my dad intervened.\n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre celebrating,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just fireworks.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe lived at the end of a street, next to a roundabout. We had three neighboring houses. Two of them were elderly couples who rarely left their homes, and the last was another family with a teenage boy. We‚Äôd hung out a bit before he started high school, but we‚Äôd fallen out of touch in the last year or so. Still, I had fond memories of watching movies on their big screen TV and playing video games. I bet they had the new Star Fox game.\n\nAs we turned the corner, the street was in chaos. The Masons were out on the lawn, arguing with two fire marshals. The other elderly couple, the Stephensons, were dragging bags to their car. The other family was nowhere to be seen, and their SUV wasn‚Äôt in the driveway. Their front door was half-open, and the lock broken. There was a piece of white paper with red text nailed to the side of the door.\n\n‚ÄúJust go to your rooms,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk over dinner.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk about it later,‚Äù he insisted. ‚ÄúFor now, I need you to stay in your rooms.‚Äù\n\nAmos looked up from his comic book.\n\n‚ÄúCan I play Nintendo?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs long as you want, honey,‚Äù mom smiled. ‚ÄúAnd tonight, there‚Äôs no bedtime.‚Äù\n\nAmos looked up at me like we were going to Disneyland. It took him a moment to realize that he was the only one smiling, and he didn‚Äôt understand why. To be fair, neither did I.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe hurried inside. Amos and I ran upstairs and got to our rooms. Amos had been allowed to keep the Super Nintendo in his room, while I had a VCR. It was fair enough. He could play games, and I could watch movies.\n\nBut I wasn‚Äôt in a mood to watch anything. I had this sinking feeling that something was terribly wrong, and I kept looking out the window; hoping to see something. The Stephensons were arguing next to their car, and the Masons were being ushered back into their house. I could see smokestacks rising from the dairy farms, and flashing lights from fire trucks going back and forth down main street. Every now and then, if I listened closely, I could hear popping noises. It didn‚Äôt sound like fireworks. It sounded like gunshots.\n\nI‚Äôd only been in my room for a couple of minutes before I heard a careful tapping at the door. Amos stepped in with this haunted look on his face; his eyes wide and unblinking.\n\n‚ÄúCan you help me with my science project?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs acting funny.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmos had been working on a science project for school. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal. He‚Äôd taken different kinds of milk and placed them in cups to see which ones went bad first. He usually checked it before he went to bed, making notes about changes over time.\n\n‚ÄúCan you please look?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really weird.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù\n\nFor something to make Amos say ‚Äòplease‚Äô, it had to be something out of the ordinary.\n\nI walked across the hall to his room, catching a whiff of an argument downstairs. Mom had raised her voice. There was a certain pitch to it when she was worried about something, and she wasn‚Äôt holding back this time. Made me feel sorry for dad. Half the time it wasn‚Äôt even him she was angry at.\n\nI followed Amos past the pause screen for Contra III and up to the window. He had the cups resting on a small metal tray, with plastic wrapping. He stopped just ahead of it.\n\n‚ÄúI heard this noise, and‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nHe pointed at the cups, clutching his notebook.\n\n‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt opened it. Mom says it smells too much.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I approached, I saw the cups rattle. Not much, but enough to make a noise. I could see the plastic wrap shaking. Looking into the cups, it took me a while to understand what I was looking at.\n\nAt first I thought it was maggots, but it wasn‚Äôt. It looked like something had coalesced at the bottom of each cup, and there were these tiny white strands shooting out of it; prodding the plastic for weaknesses. It sort of looked like an egg, in a way, with these inches long strands that moved independently of one another. All of it milky white.\n\n‚ÄúIt keeps moving,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù\n\nHe stepped up to it and put his finger on top of the plastic. The strands in the cup immediately reacted, shooting straight up. It looked almost electric in a way.\n\n‚ÄúWhy does it do that?‚Äù he asked.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe gotta put it away.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShould we tell mom?‚Äù\n\nI could hear them arguing downstairs, and shook my head.\n\n‚ÄúWe should throw it away,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs flush it.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmos protested all the way to the bathroom but didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss. I told him I‚Äôd take the blame, and he could go back to playing Contra. That seemed to do the trick.\n\nI placed the tray on the floor next to the toilet. I put on mom‚Äôs plastic cleaning gloves, just in case. As I took off the plastic wrap, those little white strands shot out of the cup; aiming straight at my face. They were a lot longer than I‚Äôd suspected, just inches away from my face. I panicked and dropped the entire cups down the toilet with a squeal.\n\nLooking down, they squirmed and twisted back and forth. These white strands whipping back and forth, like worms in agony. They were so much longer than I‚Äôd anticipated, and I could feel them prodding against the plastic gloves. They were looking for the warmth of my skin. The tips were much sharper than anticipated, and almost poked a hole in my gloves.\n\nI flushed. After waiting a few seconds, I could still see some strands moving at the bottom of the bowl. I flushed again, and again, and again. Finally, when there was nothing left, I dumped half a bottle of toilet cleaner in, flushed again, and then waited. I must‚Äôve sat there for ten minutes, just watching the water. There was this tingle in my spine, like I‚Äôd escaped some great danger. The same kind of rush you‚Äôd get if you‚Äôd nearly stepped on a snake, or seen a bear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went back to my room and brought out a notebook. ‚ÄúNo Milk‚Äù I wrote at the top. I tried to name all the places in town where there might be a lot of milk, or milk-based products. The dairy farms were obvious, but there was also the high school cafeteria, the corner shop with the soft serve machine, and the convenience store. Since this was a town with several dairy farms, milk and cheese was sort of‚Ä¶ everywhere. I listed at least two dozen locations where there might be a lot of dairy products.\n\nThere was a loud banging on the front door downstairs.\n\nAmos and I rushed out of our rooms to see what was going on. From upstairs, I saw dad open the door to a man in military uniform. Mom looked up the stairs.\n\n‚ÄúGet back to your rooms!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll tell you when you can come out, alright?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMom, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJust play your games,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWait there.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut mom, I-‚Äú\n\n‚ÄúRooms!‚Äù she yelled. ‚ÄúNow!‚Äù\n\nShe wasn‚Äôt messing around. Amos and I looked at one another and silently decided to stick together on this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a discussion between my parents and the man at the door. Amos and I retreated back to my room. He tried reading, but he kept getting distracted.\n\n‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs bad?‚Äù he asked, putting down his comic book.\n\nAmos had always been a bit of a pain. Lots of pranks and scares. But this time was different; we weren‚Äôt playing around. It was like a silent agreement.\n\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy? What‚Äôs so bad?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something wrong with the milk.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut you flushed it, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot just that milk,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAll of it. All milk in town.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all gone bad?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWorse,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLike, real bad.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat happened next was quick. I heard someone coming up the stairs, and in the next moment, my parents opened the door to my room. They asked us to remain calm. They asked us to be quiet. They asked us to come along, stay close, and don‚Äôt ask any questions.\n\nOn our way out, I saw the man in uniform stepping into our upstairs bathroom. Seconds later, he sprinted back out, yelling into his walkie-talkie. Mom and dad hurried us downstairs. Three other men rushed past us, up the stairs; dragging dirt and mud through the living room carpet on their way up. All in uniform, all armed with assault rifles. They left the front door open, and I could see at least six more people waiting outside.\n\nWe got in our car, taking nothing with us except Amos‚Äô comic book. A man tapped the driver‚Äôs seat window with his rifle, and my dad took off down the road.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt get out of town,‚Äù mom said, keeping her voice low. ‚ÄúMorgan, they‚Äôre testing women at the checkpoints.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs for the better,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúWho knows how this can affect you? You might need a‚Ä¶ a vaccine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen what they did with the dairy cows. They‚Ä¶ they take them out back, and then-‚Äú\n\n‚ÄúWe are not cattle, Ranielle! They‚Äôre not putting people ‚Äì people, Rani ‚Äì out to‚Ä¶ to pasture!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen where the hell are the goddamn Abernathy‚Äôs?!‚Äù mom roared back. ‚ÄúThem being dragged off was just for fun?! For show?!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not having this discussion,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúNot in front of the kids.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm almost in the second trimester,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúAnd God knows what they‚Äôll do if they-‚Äú\n\nMom quieted down, holding a hand to her mouth. Dad looked at her with a mix of pity and frustration.\n\n‚ÄúI-I feel strange, Morgan,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not like last time.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere‚Äôs this big four-way intersection in the middle of the downtown area. When we got to that point, the lights had turned red. There were these military trucks going by, one by one. At least a dozen, covered in blue plastic tarps. Long after the lights turned green, the trucks were still going by.\n\nAs the second to last truck was going by, there was this loud metal bang, and the entire truck started leaning. For a moment, we all thought it was going to tip over. Two of the wheels were off the ground. It tipped back down, and the driver leaned on the horn. From seemingly every corner of the street, armed men started shouting at us to move.\n\nI could see something moving under the tarp. Something sharp, poking and prodding against the plastic.\n\nI‚Äôd seen it before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDad stepped on the gas, going the other way. I saw the high school gymnasium in the distance, lined with vehicles all along the street.\n\n‚ÄúThey told us to stay here,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ hunker down and wait.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be trapped.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe can leave at any time.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go by foot. I don‚Äôt like the look of those rifles.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou know they wouldn‚Äôt-‚Äú\n\nThey exchanged a glance, and the conversation stopped. Amos and I just kept our heads down. There were still popping sounds outside. They were closer now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDad found a spot further down the street, and we made our way to the gymnasium. There were at least a hundred people gathered outside. I picked up a few things from various discussions going around. For example, the armed men were from the national guard. Most of them had shown up early that morning, probably minutes after I‚Äôd left for school.\n\nThere was a lot of talk from a lot of people. A soldier explaining something about ‚Äúlactic acid bacteria‚Äù to one of our science teachers. An old man complaining about how they took his freezer. A kid being scolded for not telling his mom he had a milkshake with his lunch. A farmhand looking distraught, saying something about the new cowfeed used at the Ansen farm, and how it was unfair for the Bowes to get shut down. Bits and pieces of a hundred different stories.\n\nBut what struck me the most was a group of young women, looking distraught. One of them kept repeating the same thing, over and over, to a soldier.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll never get rid of it?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs in there? For good?‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had to sign our names on the way in. Dad signed for the four of us.\n\nI barely recognized anyone. They‚Äôd set up green military cots, two by two, with a basic footlocker for valuables and personal belongings. Dad weaved between aisles of cots, keeping me and Amos close. Mom was looking for the restroom.\n\n‚ÄúWhen can we go back to the house?‚Äù Amos asked.\n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre checking the pipes,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúThat can take a while.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúChecking the pipes for what?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI dunno, but whatever it is, they‚Äôre making sure we‚Äôre okay.‚Äù\n\nA stone sunk into my stomach. Maybe what I‚Äôd flushed down the toiled had gotten stuck in the pipes, somehow. Maybe that‚Äôs what they saw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the next few hours, we stayed put. They handed out a couple of basic dairy-free meals. Once every two hours there were a couple of soldiers walking down the aisles, making sure everyone looked okay.\n\nBut people were far from okay. I saw this one athletic guy shaking like a leaf, coughing into his hand over and over. It sounded awful, like his body was trying to push something out. When the patrol made their rounds, they took him outside. I didn‚Äôt see him again.\n\nMom was in the bathroom for a long time. At least an hour. When she got back, she had this slightly ashen complexion, like she hadn‚Äôt slept for days. Dad was worried, but she kept telling him she was okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce it started to get dark, the patrols said they were closing down for the night. A curfew was in effect. Dad had all kinds of questions but didn‚Äôt want to start arguing with armed soldiers. I could tell he was holding back. Corporate lawyer or no, personal freedoms are a big sticking point to him.\n\nI remember this big clock over the scoreboard. If you managed to filter out the cries and the occasional scream, that clock was the only thing you could hear. And I could swear that the seconds were getting longer the more you listened to it.\n\nMom and dad shared a cot, while Amos and I got one each. Amos went out like a light, but I stayed up long after midnight. I couldn‚Äôt help it. That damn clock kept me up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the lights off, all I saw was the sharp shadows cast by the crescent moon creeping in through the cloud cover. As the screams and cries turned to sniffles and snores, I was left awake staring into the ceiling.\n\nI heard people whispering about ‚Äúmegabacteria‚Äù. Something in the methane, the lactic acid, the gas lines‚Ä¶ nobody knew for sure. There was one guy who kept muttering about birds being the source, claiming it‚Äôd rained feathers moments before ‚Äúshit hit the fan‚Äù.\n\nThere was this one drunk man by the exit who kept talking out loud to himself.\n\n‚ÄúThey dance like skinny little worms, re‚Ä¶ reaching for the stars.‚Äù\n\nSkinny little worms. Just like I‚Äôd seen in my brother‚Äôs science project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI‚Äôd been drifting in and out of sleep for one or two hours when I snapped to attention. I heard someone running past me and looked up to see mom‚Äôs side of the cot empty. Dad sat up, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúRani?‚Äù he whispered.\n\nHe noticed me looking his way.\n\n‚ÄúYou see where mom went?‚Äù\n\nI shook my head. He got up and took me by the hand.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go look.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe went down the aisles, hand in hand. It was eerie watching all these strangers sleeping around us, like nothing was going on. Even the drunk guy by the exit was out cold by now.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if I was imagining things, but I had the mental image of those ‚Äúskinny little worms‚Äù appearing. Sometimes when I looked at the sleeping people, I imagined little shadows scurrying to hide. Something crawling out of a nose, an ear, a mouth. We walked past this one man who looked sick, who had a metal bucket next to his cot. I could hear little tapping movements at the bottom of it, as if something was struggling to reach out.\n\n‚ÄúShe might be in the bathroom,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go look.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were two patrolmen by the bleachers, smoking and telling stories. They kept passing a bottle back and forth. Dad kept his head down, making sure not to look them in the eye.\n\nWe went through a short hallway and made it to the bathrooms. The power was still on, but all the lights were off, making the emergency exit sign the only thing to guide us. Dad was about to step inside the bathroom when I tugged on his sleeve.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for ladies, dad,‚Äù I said.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt mind.‚Äù\n\nWe stepped through the door. Moonlight was coming in from a frosted glass window, casting an eerie shadow across the floor. We split up and started knocking on the stalls. It was quiet. Dad had this worried look on his face.\n\n‚ÄúMaybe you should step outside for this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust for a while.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs check,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be quick.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWait, let‚Äôs-‚Äú\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI opened one of the stalls.\n\nI barely saw anything. In the moonlight, I couldn‚Äôt see much more than outlines. I saw a pair of still hands holding up a bloated belly, with these dancing little worms pushing their way out of the skin. Like a goddamn human garlic press. The tapping sound of a hundred thin parasites, looking for a new host. Some were just an inch long; others were as tall as an arm. One of them poked the nail on my thumb, but couldn‚Äôt latch on.\n\nI saw chunks of hair strewn across the floor; a side effect of late-stage infection.\n\nA hand fell over my eyes, and I was dragged outside. When I looked up, I saw dad. His entire body language had changed, like he was in pain. For a few seconds, all he did was stare at me.\n\nThen there was a bang on the door, coming from the inside.\n\n‚ÄúI-I‚Ä¶ I need you to get your brother,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI need you to get your brother, and I need you to get to the car.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut dad, what-‚Äú\n\n‚ÄúHere.‚Äù\n\nHe handed me the car keys.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm trusting you. And I need you to hurry.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut what about-‚Äú\n\nAnother bang on the door. Dad straightened his back and pushed it shut. I stepped back, feeling my pulse rise through my chest.\n\n‚ÄúGo!‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll meet you outside!‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRunning back out, some of the cloud cover had cleared outside. I started running down the aisles, trying to find my way back to Amos. It was difficult; everything looked different in the dark.\n\nThere was this woman who got out of her cot, just a few feet ahead of me. She coughed, and this avalanche of worms trickled out of her mouth. They spilled onto her chest and scattered across the floor. She turned to me; chunks of hair coming off her scalp.\n\nShe wheezed at me, her brown eyes tired from crying. She tried to say something. To call for help.\n\nBut all I heard was that inhuman wheezing, as little white worms made their way across her chest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don‚Äôt know if I was the one who started it, but someone did. That first scream. That choir of screams as lives came crashing down. There were so many parasites. So many victims. Some who‚Äôd just felt funny and tried to sleep it off, waking to a nightmare. Others had tried keeping their sickness a secret.\n\nThere were no patterns, no limits. Everyone was susceptible. Young, old, strong, frail. There were some with parasites coming out their stomachs, others through the ears, mouth, and nose. There was this one man who had them in his left eye. As they reached out to others for help, the parasites spilled from one person to the next, burrowing into their skin.\n\nI didn‚Äôt find Amos ‚Äì he found me. He kept telling me that a bad man had taken his comic book, and that he ran away looking for dad, and help. He asked a hundred questions at once, but I just grabbed him and ran; clutching the car keys so hard that my hand cramped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe made our way to the exit, but there was a rush of people going in and out like a waterfall. Someone yelled, telling people to drop to the floor. Ten others screamed back, begging for help. Others just screeched like wounded animals trying to alert the flock of incoming danger.\n\nAmos ducked to the floor, and I followed him.\n\nThen the gunshots started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe got out by crawling on all fours. One of the soldiers tripped over me, accidentally kicking me across the ribs. When we got outside, we stuck to the wall and kept a low profile. Amos couldn‚Äôt stop crying, but I just pulled him along. I could barely hear anything over my ringing ears and pounding pulse, as gunshot after gunshot rang out behind us. We crawled our way through the flowerbeds, using the high school's blue sunflowers as a cover.\n\nMost people were stuck inside. Some made their way out, filtering back into the military tents outside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmos and I made our way back to the car. My fingers barely worked as I fumbled to open the door. When I finally did, I could see more people heading our way from down the road.\n\nI got the car open and pushed Amos into the back seat. I followed him, locking the doors from the inside. We curled into the leg space between the back and front seat, hugging each other tight as I hushed him. He couldn‚Äôt stop crying.\n\nHe had so many questions piling up that they were overflowing into a jumbled mess. Questions about mom, about dad, about the people outside. About the bad man who took his comic book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the gunfire died down, people started pouring out. But they weren‚Äôt just people anymore.\n\nOne of them noticed our car. One of them spotted us inside. And after that first one came another, and then another. In less than half an hour, there were so many of them they were blocking all the windows. All I saw were silhouettes, and all I heard were wheezing noises. Bodies calling for help, begging, pressing themselves against the windows to get at us. Rattling coughs, over and over, as something inhuman settled in their throats.\n\nI could only see parts of them as they banged on our windows. There was this one man smiling at me with little worms dancing between the gaps in his yellow teeth. He pressed himself against the passenger window, meeting my gaze.\n\n‚ÄúBad man,‚Äù he groaned. ‚ÄúBad man. *Help*.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn eternity passed in the back of that car, and sometime during that eternity, the noises stopped. Maybe they moved on. Maybe they got shot. I don‚Äôt know. But at some point, the sun broke through, and we were both okay. Panicked, but okay.\n\nThere were soldiers outside, rounding up people from the gymnasium, and people from the tents. Some were sent back home after signing some documents. Others were asked to stay near their vehicles until further notice.\n\nAnd me? Well, I refused to open the door for anyone. Amos and I stayed in there for hours, until we could feel the heat baking us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, the door opened.\n\nMy dad had a spare set of keys.\n\nSeeing his familiar face outside the passenger side window was everything I needed to know that, in some way, we‚Äôd be okay. He‚Äôd locked himself in one of the stalls and kept quiet all night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking back at it, he and everyone else were forced to sign some kind of agreement. We were given a hefty compensation, and all we could say was that it was ‚Äúkiller bacteria‚Äù coming from one of the dairy farms. Which, in a sense, was true ‚Äì but it didn‚Äôt tell the whole truth.\n\nIt took dad years to build up the courage to tell me what really happened to mom. Six years, I think. Apparently, she was pregnant, but the whole thing had been a bit touch and go. They didn‚Äôt want to tell us until they were sure. She was just at the point where her body had started lactating, and milk protein just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that maybe it was her that I saw in that stall.\n\nDad took the money and left town. He and so many others. Some moved in, encouraged by the sudden price drop. I guess that‚Äôs how the town made it all the way to 2023.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n176 people died in total, directly or indirectly. But what they don‚Äôt tell you is that thousands were permanently scarred. Some of the girls who‚Äôd just entered puberty had to get sterilized, or they might risk another outbreak years down the line. They did some tests on me as well, but determined I was fine. Amos too. Guys are affected differently.\n\nI still have that bacteria in me, in some capacity. While I can eat and drink dairy nowadays, there is that part of me that just can‚Äôt bring myself to try. The thought of reliving any part of that day gives me this sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach. I feel my pulse rising just thinking about it. Seeing that white liquid fills me with the sense that there is so much moving around in it that I just can‚Äôt see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it hadn‚Äôt been for what happened that day in 1993, I think Wainley would‚Äôve been fine.\n\nBut as it stands, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs finally gone.",

    "body": "I'm 5'9, 29, M, currently down to 163, from my original weight of 188 lbs. My progress pics during my cut: http://imgur.com/gallery/fm8mq\n\nDiet: Basically tried to be super disciplined during the workweek and used the weekends to relax a little and rest. No lifting and eating what I wanted but in half or even quarter portions. Instead of 5 pork tacos, chips and guac; just two pork tacos. Even if I did really bad during a particular weekend, I tried to go extra hard Monday and Tuesday.\n\nLots of Faye plain greek fat yogurt. I averaged 12-15 lbs a week (yes, I could eat a Costco sized tub per day. Half in the morning, half at 4 pm-ish. No sweat) Made it super easy to hit my macros. I have a sushi shop near my work that offers raw salmon at a decent value ($10-12 per lunch) so that is my go-to meal if I don't bring anything to work. And for dinner, usually (rice-less) korean food or a small dinner to wrap it up. Tracked my macros with MyFitnessPal at first but stopped after I got the hang of estimating it. \n\nCycled carbs with high and low days but eventually just started listening to my body. Days I felt fine: I ate minimal carbs; other days I ate more carbs as I felt more tired or had a HIIT cardio session coming up. Aimed for 180 grams of protein a day and minimal fats. Generally was aiming for 2100 calories; later dropped it down to 1900 cals. \n\nFitness: During the week, target a muscle group per weekday. Do two compound lifts (5 sets x 5-7 reps) and three accessory lifts (3-4 sets x 10 reps). For weight, I simply referred back to my workout log and added 5 or 10 lbs from what I last lifted for that exercise. If I struggled, I reduced it a bit and kept going. Wanted to keep it simple for this cut.\n\nLifted weights 5x week but also did some HIIT group cardio sessions offered by the gym. 1-3x week. \n\nWent from 3 or 4 pullsups to an 15 or 20-ish. I typically throw on the weighted belt I use for dips and add weight to my pullups now. I absolutely love pull ups and all their variants. \n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n- using my smartphone: it does so much for me now, it was absolutely VITAL to my success. From looking up new workouts, reading Fitness subreddit threads while on the crapper, record before/after shots, listen to music, order gym supplies and supplements quickly from Amazon, so much. \n\n- using my music to help me really get in the zone and ignore the surroundings: When I walk into the gym, I nod to the front desk guy, change, get in and get out. Most of the time my bluetooth headset doesn't come off until I hit the shower. Just the focus the music my Spotify/Pandora provides really is critical\n\n- Integrating work habits with fitness habits: taking supplements, keeping healthy food in your drawer instead of candy, making calendar reminders, lunch workouts, etc. I always to keep my work life organized, this time I tried to apply this to fitness as well\n\n- getting back on the wagon: I wasn't perfect. There was a couple days were I might have given up but I knew I was going hard until July so it was easy to think \"just go hard now and get it over with since July is coming up\" That helped a lot. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- Subway chocolate chip cookies\n- Tortilla chips\n- guacomole\n- al pastor tacos\n- ignoring leg day and doing chest day instead (have stopped doing that)\n- french fries\n- ice cream\n- chocolate, all shapes and sizes\n\nUpcoming plan:\n\nCut till vacation, maintenance phase until September and then try Martin Berkhan's LeanGains aka intermittent fasting to clean bulk for the winter. And then repeat. \n\n**EDIT 1:**\n\nWow so many responses and questions! Thank you for all the kind words. Will try to respond the best I can.  \n\nSome current lifting numbers are (some are 1RM and others what I do for reps): \n\n* 225 lb 1RM bench press - kinda disappointed with this but pushing through this cut so I'm ok with it\n* 340 lb 1RM deadlift\n* 75 lb weighted dips for 4-6 reps\n* 40 lb weighted pull ups for 3-6 reps\n* 80 lb (x2) incline dumbell press 4-7 reps\n* 75 lb single arm dumbell rows 10 reps\n\nI haven't been able to see what my 1RM is for squat in a while as my gym is in an office building with limited floorspace so I'll probably join another gym with squat racks when I switch to a bulk.\n\n**My typical workout weekly schedule:**\n\nMonday with Spin/Core HIIT cardio class - lunch. Back/Bicep/Pull workout - after work.\n* pull ups - 10 reps or whatever you can x5 sets\n* Superset - Lat pulldowns 10 reps x4 sets\n* Romanian deadlifts 10 reps x4 sets\n* Superset single arm DB rows 10 reps x4 sets\n* single arm cable arm rows pyramid/drop sets to failure\n\nTuesday with Legs / Core - lunch.\n* DB Lunges - 20 steps x4 sets\n* Superset - hanging leg raises 15 reps x4 sets\n* Machine Leg extensions 10 reps x4 sets\n* Superset machine Leg curls 10 reps x4 sets\n* Standing side 'crunches' with 45 lb plate x4 sets\n\nWeds with Spin/Core HIIT cardio class - lunch. Shoulders - after work.\n* DB overhead press - 10 reps or however many you can x5 sets\n* DB lateral raises 10 reps x4 sets\n* Superset cable front raises x4 sets\n* bent over 35 lbs plate front raises\n\nThurs with Chest / Triceps / Push / Core - after work.\n* Weighted dips [heavy] 5 reps x5 sets\n* Incline DB press [heavy] 5 reps x5 sets\n* Cable flyes 10 reps x4 sets\n* Superset machine flyes 10 reps x4 sets\n* negative bench DB flyes to failure (feel that pump/lactic acid buildup)\n\nFriday with Spin/Core HIIT cardio class - lunch. Fun day (Anything the hell I want x whatever weight) - after work. \n* Super wide grip pull ups x5 sets\n* reverse grip bench press x3 sets\n* Bicep curls x3 sets\n* lat pulldowns x3 sets\n\nI try to follow and duplicate these workouts for 4-6 weeks. Then I switch it up and change the exercises but targeting the same general muscle groups. Some new lifts or ideas for new workouts come from Instagram.\n\nSaturday / Sunday - rest. If feeling particularly tired or beat up, extend rest till Monday or take a day off later that week. \n\n**Supplements I take:**\n\n* 2 multivitamins - 1 morning / 1 night\n* 3-10 fish oil caps depending if i have salmon that day\n* 1-2 servings of fiber \n\nPreworkout 1 hour before: 700 mg citrulline malate, 5 g creatine, 1.5 mg beta alanine (Carno syn), 4 g taurine, 200-600 mg of caffeine depending on how I feel or coffee already ingested, and 30 g of protein via MuscleMilk or other protein source. \n\nPost workout: spoonful of creatine mixed with water, 4 oz of fish or protein and 0 - 8 oz of rice or carbs, depending on how I feel \n\nBlack coffee throughout the day, try to not touch it on weekends but haven't noticed any issues with caffeine thankfully",

    "body": "Two days ago, there was a great post about the neglected aspects of fitness, with stretching being one of them. Coincidentially, I was researching static stretching at that time because my physical therapist told me to stretch more to address my flexibility issues. And as a scientist, I wanted to know more about stretching, what it is good for, when to do it, etc., so I read through scientific literature. This is what I found, and I hope it'll contribute to the discussion around stretching & flexibility :)\n\nTLDR: A summary of this post can be found at the bottom in the \"summary & conclusion\" section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Is Static Stretching?\n\nStatic stretching describes the lengthening of a muscle until you feel either a stretch sensation or discomfort (Cronin et al. 2008; Behm et al. 2004). Once you‚Äôre in this position, you keep the muscle stretched for a set amount of time (Ebben et al. 2004).\n\n# Does Static Stretching Increase Flexibility & ROM?\n\nInterestingly, all scientific studies published to date unanimously agree that static stretching (or all forms of stretching, for that matter), significantly increase joint range of motion (ROM). And since flexibility is defined as ‚Äúthe ability to voluntarily move a joint through its full range of motion‚Äù (Page, 2012), it‚Äôs safe to say that stretching makes you more flexible. \n\nFor example, a meta-analysis (Medeiros et al. 2016) looked at 19 randomised controlled clinical trials which investigated the effects of static stretching on hamstring\\* ROM. All 19 studies in this meta-analysis compared a static stretching to a control group and didn‚Äôt include special populations (such as the elderly, children, or professional athletes). The exact stretching protocols differed between the studies, but they all took hip-flexion ROM measurements before and after hamstring stretching. Satisfyingly, all 19 studies in this meta-analysis showed that static hamstring stretching is superior to no stretching in increasing hip-flexion ROM.\n\nAnother literature review arrived at the same conclusion: After examining 5 randomised control trials with men and women in their 20s, they found that static stretching of the hamstring is effective for increasing hip-flexion ROM (Lempke et al. 2018). \n\nBecause the hamstring stretch is easy to perform and hip-flexion ROM can easily be measured, hamstring stretching is commonly used in such studies. However, the results are not limited to the hamstring and hip-flexion ROM, as a more comprehensive literature review of 125 randomised controlled trials (which also looked at muscles other than the hamstring) found ROM improvements after static stretching, but not after no-stretching (Behm et al. 2016). \n\n*\\*Side note: The ‚Äúhamstring muscle‚Äù, as the muscles on the back of your thigh are usually referred to, actually consists of three muscles: the musculus biceps femoris, the musculus semitendinosus, and the musculus semimembranosus. They all have the same function, though, namely knee flexion and hip extension, so grouping them together makes sense (source: anatomy classes).*\n\n# How often and how long should you stretch?\n\nIt‚Äôs repeatedly been shown that static stretching increases flexibility, but how often and for how long should you actually stretch to get more flexible?\n\nA recent literature review by Thomas et al. (2018) looked at 23 peer-review studies to address this question. What they found is that the best ROM improvements are achieved by stretching at least 5 minutes per week per muscle. Increasing total stretching time beyond 10 minutes (per week per muscle) didn‚Äôt seem to result in even greater ROM improvements. Hence, a duration of 5-10 minutes per week per muscle seems optimal. \n\nThey also looked at the stretching duration per session, and arrived at the conclusion that it doesn‚Äôt matter how long each stretching session is; less than 1 minute stretching per muscle per session was as effective as more than 2 minutes of stretching per muscle per session.\n\nAnd then they also investigated if there is something like an optimal weekly stretching frequency. Indeed, their analysis suggested that 5-7 stretching sessions per week resulted in better ROM improvements than only 2-3 stretching sessions per week. \n\nAccording to them, an ideal stretching schedule to increase flexibility could look like this: \n\n* 5 stretching sessions per week, e.g., on weeks days with the weekend off\n* 1min of stretching per muscle per session, resulting in a total of 5min per muscle per week\n\n(But please keep in mind that these are just suggestions and an ideal plan *for you* might look different.)\n\n# Is a large ROM and flexibility actually a good thing?\n\nThe previous sections showed that static stretching will improve flexibility and how to achieve better flexibility. But is this actually a good thing? \n\n**Movement Patterns**\n\nIn sports that require a high degree of flexibility to perform certain movements, such as ballet or martial arts, an increased ROM is vitally important (Gleim & McHugh 1997). So, in these sports it‚Äôs definitively an advantage if you stretch often to increase the ROM of certain joints. \n\nFlexibility is also important in other forms of exercise, at least to a certain degree, to correctly execute a movement pattern. For example (and as many of you can attest to), back squat depth is highly associated with ankle dorsiflexion and hip flexion ROM (Kim et al. 2015; Gomes et al. 2020). However, whether or not an ass-to-grass squat is necessary is a different question, and will depend on the goals of the weight lifter. \n\n**Injury Prevention**\n\nWhen it comes to injury prevention, greater flexibility seems to lead to less injuries. For example, two meta-analyses of baseball players and other overhead throwers (e.g. tennis, handball) found that deficits in shoulder ROM were associated with higher shoulder and elbow injury rates (Bullock et al. 2018; Pozzi et al. 2020). The findings of these meta-reviews are probably generalisable to all kinds of body parts, but more studies are needed for confirmation. \n\nFurther, a flexibility *imbalance* might be associated with greater injury risk. This conclusion was drawn in two independent observational studies. The first study found that knee and lateral hip pain was more prevalent in senior ballerinas (n=30) with reduced hip adduction ROM (Reid et al. 1987). And the second study linked\\* a left-right imbalance in hip ROM to higher injury risk in female college athletes (n=138; Kapnik et al. 1991). \n\n*\\*purely correlational*\n\n# Can you prevent injuries through stretching?\n\nThe believe that you should statically before a workout probably aims at injury prevention. And indeed, a meta-analysis showed some effectiveness of pre-workout static stretching for injury prevention in 8 studies, while another 4 studies showed no effect (Behm et al. 2016). The authors noted that the preventative effect of static stretching depends on the type of injury looked at, with static stretching being better at preventing muscle injury than overuse injury. \n\nAnother review came to similar conclusions as they reported lower incidence of muscle- and tendon-related injuries in pre-workout static stretching groups compared to control groups. But they also reported no apparent differences between stretching and control groups when looking at overall injury rates (Woods et al. 2007). \n\nProbably, the reduced injury risk from pre-workout stretching has to do with it decreasing muscle stiffness, thereby ‚Äúmaking it more compliant to eccentric contractions and \\[‚Ä¶\\] reducing the amount of primary mechanical damage‚Äù (Howatson & van Someren 2008).\n\nStatic stretching *after* a workout can also help maintain full ROM after eccentric exercise (LaRoche & Conolly 2006; Howatson & van Someren 2008). Because the natural reflex of muscles after eccentric exercises is to shorten, with static stretching you act against these processes by elongating the muscles (Thomas et al. 2018). This will allow you to continue exercising with proper form, and can thereby prevent injury. \n\nImportantly, none of the studies included in the reviews above found a negative effect of pre- or post-workout static stretching on injury risk. So, from an injury prevention point-of-view, static stretching before your workout probably doesn‚Äôt do much (apart from preventing certain types of injury), while stretching post-workout will help you maintain full ROM. \n\n# Does (static) stretching help with recovery from injury?\n\nStatic stretching is commonly used in the treatment of muscle and tendon injuries, such as muscle strains or tendinopathies. \n\nMuscle strains are one of the most common injuries in sports medicine (Dueweke et al. 2017; Garrett 1996). They are defined as skeletal muscle injuries which result from excessive stretching during eccentric muscle contraction. The muscles most susceptible to muscle strains are those which cross multiple joints, such as the hamstrings, the adductor longus muscle, the rectus femoris muscle or the gastrocnemius (calf) muscle (Garrett 1996). \n\nFactors protecting the muscle from strains are strength, muscular endurance and flexibility (Garrett 1996). Likewise, physical therapy to restore strength and flexibility after the acute phase of muscle strain is used to help with healing the injury (Noonan & Garrett 1996; Dueweke et al. 2017; Page 2012) and will lead to functional recovery (Kim et al. 2018). \n\n# Can static stretching alleviate DOMS as well?\n\nStatic stretching increases your flexibility, and it can also be used in the prevention and treatment of muscle injuries. So, does it prevent or treat delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS)? \n\nDelayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is probably familiar to anyone who has exercised at least once in their life, and it‚Äôs a rather unpleasant sensation to most. The severity of DOMS ‚Äúcan range from muscle tenderness to severe debilitating pain‚Äù, and peaks between 24-72 hours after the workout (Cheung et al. 2003). \n\nDespite its high prevalence, the mechanism(s) of DOMS are not clearly established yet, and there are currently six different hypotheses: lactic acid build-up, muscle spasms, connective tissue damage, muscle damage, inflammation, and enzyme efflux (Cheung et al. 2003). \n\nSince we don‚Äôt fully understand the mechanisms of DOMS, it‚Äôs also hard to come up with biologically sound prevention and treatment options. However, based on the six DOMS hypotheses, several plausible measures to both prevent and treat DOMS have been proposed so far. \n\nFor example, the literature review by Cheung et al. (2003) found the following measures to be effective for either preventing or treating DOMS:\n\n* NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs): e.g., ibuprofen, both prophylactic and therapeutic \n\n(However, personally I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using it as prophylactic measure for two reasons: 1. You feel less pain, which could be an indicator of wrong form or overuse, and 2. (accidental) overdosing can result in liver damage and/or kidney failure ‚Äì please always consult with your medical doctor before taking any medication)\n\n* Massage: therapeutic (depending on the type and timing)\n* Compression socks or sleeves: both prophylactic & therapeutic\n* Light exercise: therapeutic\n\nYou might have noticed that static stretching is not on the list above. In fact, the same 2003 review found stretching to be ineffective for both preventing and alleviating DOMS.\n\nThis is in slight contrast to a 2018 randomised controlled trial with 30 men, which showed that low-intensity stretching after unaccustomed exercise can reduce *perceived* muscle soreness, but not markers of muscle damage or inflammation, when compared to high-intensity stretching or no stretching at all (Apostolopoulos et al. 2018). So, the alleviating effect they found is probably just placebo.\n\nThis being just a placebo effect goes along the findings of another literature review (Herbert et al. 2011) of 12 field- and lab-based studies with more than 2300 participants, which assessed the effect of pre-, post-, and the combination of pre- & post-exercise static stretching on perceived muscle soreness. \n\nThey found that on average, pre-exercise stretching reduced muscle soreness by 0.5 points on a 100-point scale, post-exercise stretching reduced muscle soreness by 1 point, and both pre- & post-exercise stretching reduced muscle soreness by 4 points. Given that these are ratings on a 100-point scale, there might be a positive effect of static stretching on DOMS, but it is practically negligible. \n\nHowever, it‚Äôs important to note that none of the studies found a negative effect of static stretching on DOMS, so even if you do it, you probably won‚Äôt make things worse. And the placebo effect is actually a strong one, so if you think it helps you with managing DOMS, continue doing so. \n\n# Does pre-workout stretching decrease your performance? \n\nPre-workout (static) stretching can have beneficial effects on muscle injury rate and muscle soreness. But isn‚Äôt it true that pre-workout stretching will also lead to a decline in performance?\n\nA meta-analysis of 104 randomised controlled trials with a total of 962 male and female participants found that pre-workout static stretching reduced maximal muscle strength by 5.4%, maximal muscle power by 1.9%, and explosive muscular performance by 2.0%, on average (Simic et al. 2013). \n\nIn the same meta-analysis, they also looked at the performance impairments in relation to the stretch duration (see table below). This data suggests that performance impairment increases with increasing stretch duration, and that maximal muscle strength faces the largest impairments after pre-workout static stretching (Simic et al. 2013).\n\n||<45s stretching|45-90s stretching|\\>90s stretching|overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Maximal muscle strength|\\-3.2%|\\-5.6%|\\-6.1%|\\-5.4%|\n|Maximal muslce power|\\+0.4%|\\-1.7%|\\-3.3%|\\-1.9%|\n|Explosive muscular performance|\\-0.8%|\\-2.5%|\\-4.5%|\\-2.0%|\n\nAnother meta-analysis of 125 studies by Behm et al. (2016) arrived at similar conclusions. They looked at the changes in performance measures (e.g., 1RM bench press, vertical jump height, sprint running time) with and without pre-workout static stretching. \n\nOverall, Behm et al. found a 3.7% performance reduction after pre-workout static stretching, when tested within minutes (!) of stretching. They also found a similar dose-response relationship between stretch duration and performance, with stretch durations >60s resulting in greater performance decrease (-4.6%) compared to shorter stretch durations <60s (-1.1%). Separated into power/speed- and strength-based tasks, they found a greater decrease in strength after static stretching (-2.8 to -5.1%) than in power or speed (-0.15 to -2.6%).\n\nBut why does static stretching affect performance at all? One reason might be that stretching reduces the contractile force capacity of the muscle, or that muscle stretching reduces the blood flow to and from muscle tissue, which limits the availability of oxygen and causes accumulation of (toxic) metabolic end products (Behm et al. 2016). However, these are only hypotheses so far and will need further testing. \n\nAlso, while the findings from these two reviews might be statistically significant, it‚Äôs also worth keeping the practical importance in mind. For a professional athlete, that performance decrease of a few percent might actually decide about the outcome of a competition, but for a recreational athlete it might be less of a concern. Especially since other factors, such as sleep, food intake or stress levels, will influence performance to a similar or even larger extent. \n\nAlso, this unfavourable effect of pre-workout static stretching can possibly be eliminated by a subsequent sport-specific warmup (Taylor et al. 2009). However, this study was conducted on 13 female netball players with 20m-sprints as performance measure, and might therefore not be generalisable. \n\nIn summary, there are countless studies showing a static stretch-induced performance impairment. However, the effects are small and might therefore be of less concern for recreational athletes. Furthermore, pre-workout static stretching performance impairment might also depend on several other factors, such as the duration and intensity of the stretch, the type of performance looked at, if another type of warmup is done in addition, and the study participants themselves.\n\n# Summary & Conclusion\n\n* **Static stretching increases flexibility**: If you want to get more flexible, there is hardly a way around static stretching. Ideal for increasing flexibility are 5-7 stretching sessions per week, with a total stretch duration of 5-10min per muscle per week. \n* **The degree of flexibility you need depends on the sport you do**: While being extremely flexible is not necessary for most people, it is certainly worth being flexible enough so you can properly execute all movement patterns of your sport. For instance, a ballerina might need a higher degree of flexibility than a cyclist.\n* **Flexibility deficits are linked to injury risk**: It seems that being less flexible or having a flexibility imbalance are linked to greater injury risk. However, there is conflicting data, and more studies are needed to clarify the issue. Nonetheless, there is no downside to being more flexible, so working to improve your flexibility is probably better than forgetting about it.   \n* **Static stretching is commonly used in the treatment of muscle injuries**: Primarily because it increases muscle length, improves ROM, and restores normal muscle function. \n* **Pre-workout static stretching (as part of a comprehensive warmup) can‚Ä¶**\n   * **Reduce your performance**: However, the effects were rather small and might not be of practical importance to recreational athletes, especially since there are many other factors (e.g. sleep) influencing sport performance too. \n   * **Prevent immediate muscle injury**: Stretching before a workout can potentially lower your risk for certain muscle injuries in the following workout. However, the effect was rather small as well. \n   * **Not prevent DOMS**: Unfortunately, pre-workout stretching will not influence muscle soreness after a workout in any way. \n* **Post-workout static stretching can‚Ä¶**\n   * **Maintain full ROM after eccentric exercise**: And will thus prevent ‚Äúmuscle shortening‚Äù, which can lead to injury over time. \n   * **Not reduce DOMS**: Stretching after your workout will not alleviate DOMS either. However, there might be a psychological effect of stretching that makes you *perceive* muscle soreness as less intense. So, if you find stretching helps you manage DOMS, don‚Äôt stop doing it. \n\nWhat you do with this information is entirely up to you and depends on your needs and goals. It is important to note, though, that none of the studies found a harmful effect of static stretching (if done correctly). If you are unsure how to stretch correctly, or if you are concerned it might cause you harm, I recommend talking to a qualified medical professional (e.g. a physical therapist) or a registered personal trainer about it.\n\nBut I hope that this article motivated you to work on your flexibility and provided you with the knowledge so you can decide when to stretch and for what goal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer (just because I wanna be on the safe side):**\n\n* The references are in the comments below.\n* I am not a medical doctor nor a registered personal trainer or physical therapist.

        "body": "Small contribution from a doctor of physical therapy here that I didn't see (but could have missed I skimmed)\n\nThe primary current theory for why long duration static stretching affects performance is that it interferes with the stretch relax contraction cycle. When a muscle is put on quick stretch there is a very brief period of time when activating it will lead to increased power. This can be seen when performing plyometric training. Jumping off of a box and leading it into a high jump can produce greater power than the high jump from rest. This is the Stretch relax contract cycle (sometimes has difference label, same idea). When you have performed a long duration but low intensity stretch it changes the dynamics of the interpreted length and tension of the muscles measured by both muscle spindles (measure changing length) and golgi tendon organs (measures changing tension). The amortization period (time when the muscle can produce increased force) gets thrown for a loop and it messes up your brain's calculations for generating force.\n\n\nThis basically throws elite athletes off of their game because they expect a certain amount of power, but get a different response. If the stretching was consistent in all parameters before any session it might not be an issue but static stretching that most people perform is highly variable in force, angle, persistence, and other factors which all affect your internal sensors.\n\nEvery now and then I get to whip out my bachelor's in exercise science that I got before becoming a DPT and I find the science behind fitness fascinating and underdiscussd.",

According to some short research, the  200m double amputee world record is only 2 seconds short of the normal olympic record, but there is a difference in the world record for double amputee marathons, with the non-amputee coming in ahead by 40 minutes. I do also remember Oscar Pistorius was nearly disqualified at the olympics because it was argued that prosthetics require less energy than limbs. \n\nThe point about lactic acid is fair, but you also have to remember that your muscles also have myoglobin which stores oxygen and can concurrently filter out the acid. And at the same time, your muscles apply a lot more force than any current running prosthetic, because they are mainly passive devices.\n\n I believe that myoglobin grows exponentially as well, so your muscles are more efficient with greater mass and less efficient with less mass, but don't quote me on that.\n\nSo in all, I doubt it would be easier at a distance, but since the double amputee Blake Leeper was fast enough to qualify for the the 400m in the typical olympics, I would say it's probably more efficient in short but not long term, due to energy expenditure and general changes to the mechanics of their stride.",

        "body": "Actually yes, I believe so.\n\nThere was a YouTube video I watched a few years ago about something similar: [star fox running with prosthetics game theory](https://youtu.be/F6Np3_ZLOH8)\n\nSo basically a summary of what I remember is that the \"feet\" of prosthetics can bend really well, making the efficiency much greater. When you run, your joints are all that will (hopefully) bend, and I'm sure you might know the pain in your knees if you run too much. Having several points to bend and spring off, the forces needed to run are less when you have a prosthetic. Also, the video mentions it at 12:00 I guess, I haven't watched it in a while.\n\nHowever, it depends on types of leg prosthetic.\n\n[This kind of prosthetic](https://images.app.goo.gl/xgWorPGfhLDUDoRc7) is very flexible, it would give a great bounce to your step, increasing your acrobatics skill. The downside I imagine is that they wear out quicker than you'd like and your balance when standing might not be great. Not *bad* but imagine standing on a trampoline, instead of some dirt. It doesn't look like a leg. I'm not even sure if the knees work in that picture, the bending in the \"feet\" may be enough.\n\n[This one resembling an actual leg](https://images.app.goo.gl/YjymWMRMsVXG5feo8) has joints, although I'm not sure how you curve them. From what I understand until recent innovations in \"mind controlled\" limbs, it would be like flexing a muscle in a certain way. Even if it perfectly simulates a leg, it has joints and as such is not as similar to a spring.\n\nMainly what I know about these things is from knowing people without their limbs, a guy from my school many years ago had no limbs, he had a couple hook prosthetics for hands, and a wheelchair to get around. Whenever he wanted to grab something, he'd tense up his muscle (bicep I believe) which would push the two hooks together. I'm not a doctor and I don't make a habit of staring at people's prosthetics or learning a lot about them, so I could be wrong about some of this. But yes, I think they do in fact run easier, and a little faster too (in the case of the first picture).",

    "body": "Hello all! So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn‚Äôt hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible.¬†\n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!),¬†niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae. This is my one non-negotiable skin care item.\n\n[**Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Eczema-Therapy-Moisturizing-Sensitive/dp/B003O7IBZC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-3&keywords=aveeno%2Beczema&th=1) \\- Super moisturizing. **Colloidal oatmeal**, glycerin, panthenol, petrolatum, a ceramide, dimethicone. (People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).) And [Aveeno Eczema Therapy Night Time Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Baby-Nighttime-Colloidal-Dimethicone/dp/B01HI7VY84/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-4&keywords=aveeno+eczema) for something heavier but has same ingredients. You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

The Triderma cream is really \"strong\" for a lack of a better description.. I normally used Aveeno Eczema therapy cream or CeraVe but the innisfree gel & cosrx snail essence makes them pill. I'm gonna switch out those two for something else because I love those creams and would like to have the choice to use it.\n\nThe La Roche Posay cleanser actually washes off clean, unlike the CeraVe Hydrating.\n\n(For people who are worried about parabens and hydroquinone, there is no need, we eat FAR more parabens and hydroquinone than we would ever put on our skin. Hydroquinone is not \"banned\" in other countries. It's just prescription-only because it's a very strong active so governments decided that people will need to use it under a doctor's supervision to avoid abuse.)",

I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I‚Äôve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

He appeared to be on a holopad call, so I returned the gesture without saying a word. The Tilfish scientist was under a lot of scrutiny, after his leadership of the memory transcript project led to reviving me. There was additional pressure to extend the uploading capabilities beyond humans, though neuroscience from an Earth-based company was most advanced with our own kind. Legislators were keen to get involved, despite the fact that Austrian authorities and the UN had been apprised ahead of time. I intended to weigh in on that when the Sapient Coalition called, but securing aid for the war was a higher priority. Even synthetic bodies couldn't survive antimatter bombs; this endangered every being in our space.\n\n‚ÄúAs I was saying, there‚Äôs been a vast uptick in the number of people participating in memory transcripts, ever since we announced Meier‚Äôs success. It‚Äôs insurance against death!‚Äù Virnt gushed to the person on the other end of the phone. ‚ÄúMore machines are getting installed‚Ä¶some in public places. Everyone will be able to be reborn after death! It needs to be in every hospital, so we can scan anyone who passes through the doors or dies on the operating table.‚Äù\n\nI turned to face Kuemper, as she slid into the back of the vehicle. ‚ÄúIs that what you‚Äôd want, if something happened to you now?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes. My specific consciousness would still end, granted, but a part of me would live on and get to see the future,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúI had a scan a few years ago. I plan to update my memories every so often, so they can restore me as I was.‚Äù\n\nThe Tilfish continued jabbering into the line. ‚ÄúElias has been quite successful. He is truly immortal so long as our servers and data survive! If something happens, we have his program exactly as it was‚Äîit can be restored. I know he‚Äôs had his struggles, but I‚Äôm planning to swap out his eyes this week. It‚Äôll be no different than surgery; go to sleep, wake up with modifications.‚Äù\n\nI hesitated to close the car door. ‚Äú*What* are you doing to my eyes?!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou wanted eyelids, so I‚Äôm going to give them to you. I‚Äôll tell you later! Anyhow, as I was saying, we‚Äôre working to improve the sensory suites. Taste and smell are tricky. Proprioception, equilibrium, and motion detection are easier to fine-tune; they‚Äôre a bit rudimentary now. Humans are complicated and have a thousand chain reactions to different environments. I‚Äôd like Elias to test out things like‚Ä¶swimming underwater, standing on one leg, or typing with his eyes closed once we give him eyelids.‚Äù\n\n*I‚Äôm learning new fears. I don‚Äôt want to hear any more of this conversation.*\n\n‚ÄúStart the car,‚Äù I grumbled, shutting the door. ‚ÄúPlease. Covering my ears doesn‚Äôt work that well, and he‚Äôs talking pretty loud.‚Äù\n\nVirnt‚Äôs mandibles parted with delight, likely because he‚Äôd been asked something about human senses. ‚ÄúBalance comes from inner ear fluid, sloshing around; that‚Äôs not so easy to replicate, so we‚Äôre more applying the predicted stimuli that would occur *if* that fluid was there! However, you also rely on your eyes and body awareness. Humans are remarkable‚Äî‚Äù\n\nThe vehicle started off down the road, leaving the overexcited Tilfish behind. The car ride was a perfect showcase of just why my three senses needed fine-tuning; the sensation that I wasn‚Äôt breathing escalated to levels of panic, while my ‚Äúsuffocating‚Äù body experienced waves of nausea. I *needed* to suck down oxygen to steady myself, to feel any of the input from my metal form as genuine. My limbs shook involuntarily, and I suddenly wished I walked down to Embassy Row, like I had during my visits to the Ulven and Racads. It hadn‚Äôt been as bad in a spaceship with inertial dampeners, where I‚Äôd had minimal view of my surroundings. Then again, I‚Äôd been curled up in a ball for that trip.\n\nKuemper‚Äôs eyebrows knitted together, before she placed a palm atop my hand to ground me. ‚ÄúAfter Virnt announced all that to the world, I think I can figure out what‚Äôs going on. Cars are no good?‚Äù\n\nI shook my head, hating that I *could* feel sick to my non-existent stomach; it was phantom pain. The Secretary-General brought the car to a halt while I hugged the door, face pressed up to the window. The grating sensation that I was holding my breath was always present, but now, it felt like I was swallowing water by the bucketful. How could a car ride have sent my programming on such a cascade? The smallest, mundane experiences were now something I had to worry would set off my brain, and put me into a full state of panic from wrong signals. I wanted to apologize to Kuemper for creating such a scene, and pulling myself together for a few minutes.¬†\n\n*Virnt, I know you‚Äôre reading this. Add this to your bug fix list‚Ä¶pun intended.*\n\nThere‚Äôd been zero ways to cope or find relief, in the thick of it. The general sensation of unwellness hung over me, along with a desperate desire to inhale through my nose. I found the strength to unhook the door‚ÄîI had to get out of this car, or it would be my second coffin. Perhaps I could walk off the episode in the punishing July heat. Back when I was a human, diplomatic attire was punishing in these months, with sweat drenching me from head to toe. Looking down at my shoes, I could see the pavement shimmering as it reflected the scalding sun. Nobody without a robotic body should be out in this weather, and I‚Äôd meet Kuemper there. However, her car merely rolled alongside me, matching my pace.\n\n‚ÄúGo on without me,‚Äù I offered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I know the way to Embassy Row; I‚Äôll catch up.‚Äù\n\nKuemper raised an unimpressed eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know which one is the Leshee embassy, and there are 150-plus of them. I want to keep an eye on you anyway.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOk. I‚Äôll pick it up‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not like I can get tired. Hell, I won‚Äôt be out of breath if we talk while I run.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never been in better shape. The best persistence predator this planet has ever seen.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou have a good point. Even death couldn‚Äôt stop me.‚Äù\n\nI started off at a light jog, not trusting my limbs not to do something zany. Gray-haired Elias hadn‚Äôt been a marathon runner‚Äîa contest I imagined our alien neighbors didn‚Äôt enjoy watching‚Äîbut my present form could sprint without ceasing. There was no burning from lactic acid within muscles, only legs complying with the demands they were given. There were a multitude of stares and people recording, as they realized who I was; I supposed tearing down the streets of Vienna in July in a full suit-and-tie attracted attention. I found myself grinning at the absurdity. My pupils scanned to ensure I didn‚Äôt run into anyone, not wholly trusting my depth perception.¬†\n\nThe amusement died down as we neared the diplomatic entrance to Embassy Row, and I spotted a memorial park situated just shy of it. My legs slowed just long enough to read the entrance plaque, head turning to face it. It had a list of names of all humans who died *outside*¬†of Earth during the Federation War, with several walls lined up within a cobblestone circle. That wasn‚Äôt what had caught my notice out of my periphery. It was the bronze statue that I‚Äôd registered, one with a face that I couldn't help but recognize. A cold feeling stirred within, gazing at a spitting replica of Elias Meier. They built‚Ä¶*statues*¬†here to remember me.¬†\n\nHow did I even feel about that? *My name* was on the wall right alongside thousands of others, who hadn‚Äôt gotten any second chance. I picked up the pace with new urgency, all too eager to get away from my likeness. Maybe this new body was just a thinking statue to Elias, the pacifist icon of the UN. There was no time to fall back into such thoughts, since I didn‚Äôt want to cause our tardiness to the meeting. We were practically at the embassies, and from there, I could follow the Secretary-General‚Äôs car to the Leshee‚Äôs turf. Kuemper‚Äôs motorcade bypassed the stringent security, with the checkpoint gates opened ahead of our arrival.¬†\n\nI‚Äôd zoned out as we wove to a domed building, where iridescent, frog-like beings waited for us. A gray blur appeared in my periphery, swooping down toward me; that proved enough to jolt me back to the present. Korajan had landed right next to us from the sky, gliding alongside me for a split second. Though I was startled at first, I managed to recover without flinching. The Secretary-General‚Äôs motorcade proceeded ahead of me to the reception area, where Leshee staff waited to greet us. I walked a few paces behind with the Duerten ambassador, taking on a calm amble and straightening myself up. The avian parted his beak, eyes curious.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to ask for us to get you an audience in front of the Shield,‚Äù Korajan stated as a fact. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what my UN contacts seemed to imply.‚Äù\n\nI nodded. ‚ÄúWe were hoping you‚Äôd help us.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo human has ever been allowed to visit during Shield meetings, Elias. Many feel that would be the beginning of us merging with the SC, rather than keeping an autonomous union. If I might be so frank, certain parties maintain communications with Earth because they see it as a necessity.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIn what way? In case you need our assistance?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs rather impolite. You‚Äôre the¬† dominant power in our galactic neck of the woods, and they don‚Äôt want to war with you. They‚Äôd rather interact with the UN on some level, since it beats the perceived alternative. There would be great animosity toward an ‚Äòintrusion‚Äô in our halls.‚Äù\n\nI clasped my hands behind my back. ‚ÄúWhat do *you* think, Korajan? Why are you telling me this?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think you have proof now that the Sapient Coalition is threatened, and you believe you could rally us to your cause. My advice is not to look too far outside the Duerten Forum or the Leshee Junta. I do have great respect for humans, and I know *that* treatment hurts you more than you let on.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve faced worse. I‚Äôm curious, Korajan, how you became an ambassador on Earth. Did you always have such favorable views of humans?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the Duerten admitted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the patterns in your social dynamics and customs over time. Originally, I was half-hoping the worst commentary about you was true. A part of me *wished*¬†you would rip me to shreds or lose control while I was alone on your world. I wanted a human to swallow me whole before my grief did.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm so unspeakably sorry. It‚Äôs my sincere hope that your mental state has changed for the better.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt most certainly has. Honestly, what helped me most was visiting a live music bar, and listening to songs a local band wrote about Earth‚Äôs bombing. It reminded me of‚Ä¶a lot of things. They started to recognize me, and I understood their pain so intrinsically, Elias. I started playing the tambourine just so I could join their jam sessions. Even learned enough English to songwrite a little with them.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wonderful that you found the right people, Korajan. If you ever feel inclined to share your songs with me, I‚Äôd be honored.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps I will. It might be unbecoming of an ambassador, but I‚Äôm offering all of this in the spirit of friendship. I‚Äôll still help you, whatever you decide. Just be aware of what you‚Äôre getting into.‚Äù\n\nThe two of us fell in alongside Kuemper, who was exchanging pleasantries with Leshee Ambassador Yali. The amphibian looked a bit uncomfortable by my presence, which I found understandable; it wasn‚Äôt discrimination over my species, but my unique circumstances. I wondered about how long I‚Äôd be the sole revived brain scan. It was unfortunate to have nobody to talk to that was going through the same thing, as was often the therapeutic practice for other traumatic events. Then again, I didn‚Äôt want to bring anyone else back to this reality until Virnt had ironed out the flaws. My self-awareness heightened as I saw a Terran metal detector in the entrance, and hung back‚Äîknowing full well I‚Äôd trip it.\n\n‚ÄúMaybe I should stay here,‚Äù I whispered to Kuemper. ‚ÄúAre you okay with Virnt reading‚Ä¶sensitive state discussions? He has access to everything I see.‚Äù\n\nThe Secretary-General snorted. ‚ÄúThat Tilfish has our top clearance level. He has to, with the important figures he‚Äôs done memory scans on. Not to mention he‚Äôs worked with the military and Project Chronicle.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRight. Give me a moment to, ah, collect my bearings.‚Äù\n\nKorajan hopped through the detector, beckoning to me. ‚ÄúElias is going to set off the security alarms, Ambassador Yali. You know, I shudder to think that resurrected Duerten might not be able to fly. I mean, we need light bones, and metal is quite the opposite.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat happens if a metal predator goes on a rampage? He‚Äôs unkillable,‚Äù Yali whispered to the Duerten, soft gums showing in her mouth.\n\n*I don‚Äôt think the Leshee meant for me to hear that, but I suppose the exterminators wouldn‚Äôt have much impact on me.*\n\nFumbling for a way to reassure the amphibian, I strolled through the checkpoint, setting off a series of alarms. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem a pleasant way to start a diplomatic meeting, weighing whether we can kill each other. I have always been an advocate of peace, and spent my tenure *avoiding* unnecessary bloodshed. We‚Äôre here in the hopes of banding together against a novel threat.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe United Nations recognizes how vital the Leshee are to the Shield. We hope to not only offer a warning, but to find a path forward that keeps civilians out of harm‚Äôs way,‚Äù Kuemper chimed in.\n\nYali hopped toward a seating area, eyes filled with anxiety. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hear what you have to say, but I would appreciate if we could keep this brief. I‚Äôm not accustomed¬†to *this* type of human, Madam Secretary-General.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd be happy to recuse myself if it‚Äôd put your mind at ease,‚Äù I responded. ‚ÄúBelieve me, Ambassador, I‚Äôm not used to this type of human either, yet I have to live in this body. Perhaps I belong on the sidelines, though I assure you, my only intent was to gather allies. Until I stay dead, I‚Äôll never stop trying to find new friends for humanity, and achieve the harmonious future I‚Äôve always dreamed of.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe Leshee are your friends, Mr. Elias Meier. We have helped you before in the hopes that you‚Äôd show up, if we ever needed it. However, my government is beginning to feel this is a bit one-sided. You seek aid often, without anything given in return.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you seek monetary or material recompense, we can arrange that,‚Äù Kuemper stated. ‚ÄúHowever, we always considered our relations to be a mutual alliance.‚Äù\n\nKorajan parted his beak. ‚ÄúThe Duerten will not keep score, as we are forever in debt to Earth and her people. Humanity saved Kalqua, Yali, and they‚Äôd help you. Consider it fortunate your planet was not subjected to an orbital barrage.‚Äù\n\nSympathy glistened in the Leshee‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúWe would never wish such a thing upon ourselves. My words are merely reflecting the uneven nature of our present arrangement, should the humans wish to call on us for a favor again.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúForgive me, but have you ever *asked*¬†anything of us?‚Äù I chimed in. ‚ÄúIf the roles were reversed, and you came to us for ten favors in a row, we wouldn‚Äôt be settling a ledger. We would extend a helping hand out of our goodwill and generosity. That is the definition of a friend: someone who is there no matter what, when you need them most.‚Äù\n\nKuemper cleared her throat. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt here for ourselves, and even the times we have been, it‚Äôs to save lives. We care for our citizens, and will always step in to resolve issues outside of Earth. I find it unfortunate that humans in Shield space are imperiled to this day, though we are grateful for any and all assistance the Leshee have given.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA question, if you‚Äôll humor a ‚Äòmetal predator.‚Äô For all the talk of our inherent violence and *rampages,* how many times have you needed to approach us regarding any of your people on Earth?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOnce,‚Äù Yali replied, lowering her head. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôd been a train accident, it turned out. Human rescue workers dug a little girl out of the rubble, resuscitated her twice‚Ä¶refusing to give up on saving her. The surgeons operated on her for hours, showing no appetite for her insides or the blood aromas swirling around them‚Äîonly deep-rooted concern.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps such a story could buy us a bit more goodwill, my friend. It‚Äôs proof that we give to anyone in need, and seek nothing for it.‚Äù\n\nKorajan fluttered his wings. ‚ÄúI can attest to their kindness. I‚Äôve witnessed it. Their involvement in this disaster started to help the Sivkits, a party outside their organization, who‚Äôd turned away from us all for decades. Humanity heeded the call regardless.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNow, they‚Äôve entered our space. Three massive drone contingents, on separate vectors, were detected on a stealthy route into the heart of our territory,‚Äù Erin Kuemper added. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know their destination, but we suspect Nishtal is a likely target. Help us protect the homeworld we just now rebuilt. The Shield knows what an arduous process that was.‚Äù\n\nI nodded my head, turning my eyes toward the friendly Duerten. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve absolutely heard what Korajan expressed, about risking your own assets on account of the Sapient Coalition. That takes tremendous nobility and courage. However, even the slightest contributions could make a difference. Count the fingers I have on a hand‚Äîthat‚Äôs all the ships it would‚Äôve taken to stop one bomber that hit Kalqua or Earth. That‚Äôs all it takes to save millions of lives.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you put it like that‚Ä¶I‚Äôll see if we can spare a small number. Every ship does make a difference,‚Äù the avian ambassador murmured.¬†\n\nThere was a brief spell of hesitation, as the Leshee ambassador pondered our words. Her species and ours shared the common link of being judged for biological requirements, as their tadpoles required water to survive. Since the Kolshians viewed that as a vector for disease, the amphibians were ostracized and considered unclean. They‚Äôd grown their influence as the Shield‚Äôs numbers grew, though they still clung to old Federation rhetoric‚Äîlike most species in their organization. I hoped that they could put aside the dogma long enough to act for the common good.\n\n‚ÄúWhile the Krakotl have become dietarily contemptible‚Ä¶like many Coalition members, after being around you‚Ä¶I will recommend that my government intercedes on Nishtal‚Äôs behalf,‚Äù Yali decided. ‚ÄúNow if that‚Äôs all‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not.‚Äù\n\nThe words tumbled from my mouth, reaching a snap decision after recalling my conversation with Korajan. I shifted my eyes back and forth between the Duerten and the Secretary-General, searching for approval. My old friend‚Äîa former SETI scientist having reached the top echelons of the UN‚Äîgave me a nod. While it would make a fractional difference to acquire any manner of aid, we couldn‚Äôt set our aim that low. My goal heading into this was to knock on every door I could, and Korajan‚Äôs warning only convinced me that galactic change was still a necessity. The Shield fearing us wasn‚Äôt something that we wanted; they weren‚Äôt our enemies, and it was high time their members realized that fully.¬†\n\nIf Noah had risked his literal head with a hostile audience, it fell on my shoulders to do the same. I was a diplomat that wasn‚Äôt in physical jeopardy, and like Virnt gushed on his call, my ‚Äúprogram‚Äù could be restored in the worst case scenario. Someone had to start down the path of warming the Shield, as an entity, toward our cause.\n\n‚ÄúI would like to visit the Shield,‚Äù I stated with confidence. ‚ÄúI know the Leshee have the sway to arrange such a meeting. I‚Äôm well aware that you haven‚Äôt invited a human within your halls, since your formation. However, if you invite me, that will remain true. Any metal detector can tell you I‚Äôm not human.‚Äù\n\nYali seemed dumbfounded. ‚ÄúThen what are¬†you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI asked that same question when I woke in a lab, Ambassador. You know that I‚Äôm something beyond predator or prey‚Ä¶that we‚Äôre *all*¬†moving toward something far outside the animal kingdom. Instead of worrying whether I‚Äôm unkillable, the Shield should be asking whether you could be too. You don‚Äôt want a golden age of progress to pass you by. You don‚Äôt want it not to come about at all because a war took us down.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOpening your doors could strengthen technological trade between our forums,‚Äù Kuemper tacked on. ‚ÄúIf we can work together during wartime, there‚Äôs no reason we can‚Äôt better each other outside of it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIs that why Elias came? You‚Äôre dangling your new discovery in front of us?‚Äù the Leshee ambassador asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see what we have to gain, aside from this elusive promise, by bringing you into our midst. I don‚Äôt see what *you* have to gain.‚Äù\n\nI smiled, nostalgia flickering in my mind. ‚ÄúGood things happen when humanity reaches out. We entered a Federation meeting, and convinced dozens to abide our existence; we owe our survival to that. There was also a tiny portion that chose to befriend us because of our plea. I wish to speak a few words, and if one party warms to us for it, I‚Äôll consider it worthwhile. We only *ever* reached out to the stars in search of friends, Ambassadors.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI searched tirelessly in the hopes that we weren‚Äôt alone,‚Äù Kuemper agreed. ‚ÄúWe want to share the universe with others. Nothing more, nothing less.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI find that to be a beautiful notion,‚Äù Korajan interjected. ‚ÄúThere have been a vast many positives that came from humanity‚Äôs survival and networking. We only know who we truly are because of them. The Leshee aren‚Äôt judged by your peers for your aquatic aptitudes, either.‚Äù\n\nI gave the Duerten a nod of gratitude. ‚ÄúWe have never once tried to force you to merge with us, or engage against your wishes. The Shield exists as a free entity today because our ambassador spoke at a meeting for a few minutes, twenty-four years ago. What could it hurt to give us the same opportunity today, and see what might come of it?‚Äù\n\nAfter another lengthy pause, one where the tension gnawed at my mind, Yali heaved a flustered sigh. ‚ÄúVery well. I‚Äôll approach my superiors about this, and tell them what you‚Äôve said. Our embassy will be in contact if they grant you an audience. Please, leave now‚Ä¶before I change my mind.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThank you. I‚Äôm deeply appreciative that you‚Äôve heard our case, and have been receptive to our words. We won‚Äôt trouble you any longer.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHave a pleasant rest of your afternoon, Ambassador Yali,‚Äù Kuemper said, rising to her feet. ‚ÄúThese will be historic steps toward a bright, prosperous future. I look forward to improving the dialogues between our species. My thanks as well to Ambassador Korajan for his supportive presence.‚Äù\n\nThe Duerten squawked in amusement. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt thank me for speaking the truth. It‚Äôs a simple gesture.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve always liked simple gestures.‚Äù\n\nI felt a bit less off-putting and out of place upon our departure. With a solid chance at receiving an invitation to the Shield‚Äôs place of governance, I thought that the Leshee meeting had been a sweeping success. Flexing my diplomatic muscles paid dividends today, suggesting cyborg Meier still had enough charisma to stay in the game. In the spirit of optimism, it was time to plan just how I‚Äôd tackle my visit to the Shield.¬†\n\n---\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/195q9rx/the_nature_of_predators_21/)¬†|¬†[Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1d0d8dx/the_nature_of_predators_239/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1d5opdw/the_nature_of_predators_241/)\n\n[Star Crossed \\[Multiple Free Sample Chapters\\]](https://www.patreon.com/posts/100228083?utm_campaign=postshare_creator)¬†|¬†[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/spacepaladin15)¬†|¬†[Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/)¬†|¬†[Discord](https://discord.gg/Dqj4HkRdpw)¬†|¬†[Paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ5QNWBV)¬†|¬†[NOP2 Species Lore](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/s/G4hG1VS5wa)",

    "body": "Hi!\n\nHere is a thing that I suspect the rest of you lot already know, but just in case ...\n\nI've had chronically dehydrated (yet oily, break-out prone) skin for years and have discovered an embarrassingly simple thing that has (I think) really helped. I'm 41F, and have tried lots of different routines over the years to calm down my bad-tempered skin, before simplifying it right down.\n\nFor ages I'd been putting my moisturiser ‚Äì Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturiser with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, [this one](https://www.vanicream.com/product/vanicream-daily-facial-moisturizer) ‚Äì on DAMP skin, then waiting 10 mins or so before applying La Roche Posay Anthelios Ultra SPF50+ (in the mornings) or 0.05% tretinoin (every other evening). This was fine, but not GREAT. My skin often still eventually felt tight and flaky during the day, and I always had redness. I did a few other basic little treatments very occasionally, like using TO's lactic acid before moisturising, sometimes a hydrating sheet mask, sometimes LRP Cicaplast Baume at night, etc..\n\nRecently I tried putting the Vanicream on, um, SOPPING WET skin. Like, dripping wet from the shower. Just mixing the moisturiser in with all the water, doing a little massage, and then letting it dry. Now, is this messy and a bit annoying? Yes. Does it take a good 15‚Äì20 minutes to dry? Also yes. But: my god! My skin just slurps it all up! It's like a cactus that has not seen rain in 200 years! Even just doing this at nighttime, my skin looks and feels so SO much better. SO MUCH BETTER. I am humbled by it, yet furious. A lot of my redness and irritation has gone away. My skin feels much smoother and softer and breakouts have calmed down. Even my hyperpigmentation somehow looks better. I've started doing the wet face routine in the mornings as well, making myself late, but my skin has got even better so I simply do not care.\n\nThe hyaluronic acid with water is most likely the key factor here, but it turns out my face needed to be a lot wetter and drippier than I'd thought it did.

If you've been around on the sub long enough you'll already know because I spam it all over the place as a way to cope with my wild rage at the shitty medical care I've received over the years lol.\n\nGeneral info:\n\n* ‚Å†**It's a marathon, not a sprint.** Pace yourself, be patient and gentle with your body. PCOS is very diverse! It may take trial and error to figure out what makes your PCOS tick, and you absolutely cannot give up or beat yourself up about it. Black and white thinking, perfectionism, comparison, and catastrophising are dangerous.\n* **Get educated and advocate for yourself with the doctor.** The average primary care doctors' knowledge of PCOS is probably like 10-15 years outdated. If they mean well, you can still work with them to get good care, but many doctors don't take PCOS seriously or care about it unless it's a fertility issue. If you can't fire them, [here‚Äôs](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/pukm82/a_small_tip_about_dealing_with_doctors_who_dont/) a link to **advice on how to deal with shitty doctors**.\n* Make sure they ruled out [Cushing‚Äôs Disease ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/r9myk2/psa_please_read_if_you_have_been_diagnosed_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)or a thyroid issue that could cause symptoms similar to PCOS.\n* **Get your insulin resistance under control** if it‚Äôs not already. You may want to get double checked for insulin resistance because A1C levels can be misleading. Get a fasting insulin test and keep in mind that a result of 7 or above suggests some degree of IR, even if it's technically within \"normal\" range. Supplements like inositol ([40 Myo-Inositol: 1 D Chiro inositol ratio](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341764736_The_401_myo-inositolD-chiro-inositol_plasma_ratio_is_able_to_restore_ovulation_in_PCOS_patients_comparison_with_other_ratios)) or berberine can help, as can prescription medications like metformin. They work best with complementary diet and exercise routines. Check out \\*\\*glucose goddess'\\*\\* tips on how to blunt glucose spikes.\n* ‚Å†[Get your blood work done!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/rouh0x/appt_with_endocrinologist_what_shall_i_ask_for_to/hq193en/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) \\*\\*Don't assume they will do all the right tests.\\*\\* Have them **check your fasting insulin (levels above 7 are not \"optimal\"), inflammatory markers (c-reactive protein) & adrenal hormones, reproductive hormones, vitamin levels (D, B), and mineral levels (iron, calcium, zinc, chromium,** [**magnesium**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/rtlheb/i_started_taking_magnesium_and_some_interesting/hqvduzi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)**).** Vitamin D In particular is VERY much implicated in anxiety and depression symptoms, IR, and hormonal imbalances.\n* \\*\\*Consider medications.\\*\\* Many people find **birth control** helps with menstrual irregularity and pain, and studies show it helps prevent certain forms of cancer. Others find it aggravates their insulin resistance or makes them feel shitty. Similarly, many people take **metformin** to help with insulin resistance and have different reactions to it. If you haven‚Äôt already, ask your doctor to see what works for you! Other medications that are often prescribed include **spironolactone** to block androgens or **clomid** to treat infertility. If you need \\*\\*antidepressants\\*\\*, ask you prescriber about \"diabetic friendly\" options that will not aggravate insulin resistance. Some antidepressants like sertraline may make your IR worse.\n* \\*\\*The wisdom of losing weight in order to treat PCOS has some basis, but it's also kind of ass-backwards.\\*\\* If you're struggling inexplicably with weight loss, think about addressing insulin resistance, inflammation and stress first and foremost so you body heals enough to let you lose weight. Extreme calorie deficits are dangerous and rarely lead to sustainable weight loss.\n* You can ask your doc to refer you to a **registered dietitian** (be extra careful to verify nutritionist credentials if you‚Äôre in the US because they don‚Äôt have the licensure requirements of dietitians, and many of them are quacks), **mental health specialist** (PCOS means you‚Äôre more likely to have eating disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, autism and ADHD), and/or an **endocrinologist** who specializes in hormones and metabolism.\n\nDiet and supplements:\n\n* Consider taking **evidence-based supplements to manage insulin resistance, inflammation and/or hormones**. Two cups of Spearmint tea per day keeps the testosterone away! Saw palmetto may also help reduce androgen levels. To manage insulin resistance, consider inositol. [Here‚Äôs why lots of us on this sub are fans of inositol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/rrhj0v/is_ovasitol_worth_the_price/hqglj85/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) Berberine, L-carnitine, NAC and cinnamon might be helpful, too. Common vitamin and mineral deficiencies in PCOS that you might want to supplement for include D, E and B vitamins, iron, magnesium, chromium and zinc.\n* **Inositol is sometimes tricky at first.** Make sure you get the 40:1 ratio from a reputable vendor. Don't take all that inositol all at once. You probably don't want to deal with diarrhea!  Just start with a quarter dose and wait for your body to adjust, and then incrementally up your dose. If you're prone to hypoglycemia, make sure to eat it with food rather than on an empty stomach. Space it throughout the day if you can. You may notice effects on your mood and appetite immediately, you may not. For me personally it took almost 6 months to start working wonders on my cycle and metabolism, paired with a complementary diet and exercise routine.\n* ‚Å†Eat an **anti-inflammatory diet.** Google the term and you‚Äôll find lots of reputable guides.\n* ‚Å†**Figure out how to approach carbs.** Some people omit them almost entirely and go on the **ketogenic diet**, which helps them lose weight and manage PCOS symptoms. Others find keto makes them feel worse or it‚Äôs hard to maintain. Research suggests that people with PCOS tend to do well on a **low carb and/or low glycemic Mediterranean diet.** If you eat carbs make sure they are lower on the glycemic index (think quinoa instead of white rice) and that you pair them with other food groups to [prevent glucose spikes](https://allarahealth.com/balancing-your-blood-sugar-with-pcos/) and insulin resistance.\n* ‚Å†**Learn to cook!** Or if you already do, learn fun new healthy recipes that you love. Make it a fun activity with music, exploration and loved ones if you can. [Some quick recipe ideas here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/rtzv6u/im_having_trouble_cutting_carbs/hqwaety/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3).\n* ‚Å†**Figure out what dairy (and other foods) does to you**. Some people love dairy as a source of probiotics, protein, and satiating fat, and find it has no negative effects on digestion, skin or insulin resistance. But some people finds that even modest portions are too much. Sometimes people with inflammatory issues also have other food allergies and sensitivities. If you suspect you have any, try to experiment with your diet and see if eliminating things works for you. Consulting with a dietitian or allergist might be beneficial, too!\n* Some people have lots of success with **intermittent fasting**! It isn‚Äôt for everyone and I‚Äôd stay away from it if you have a history of disordered eating, but it might be worth giving a try. The book ‚ÄúThe PCOS Plan‚Äù by Dr Nadia Brito Pateguana and Dr Jason Fung is a good resource to learn more.\n* Is the **cost of groceries** making it hard to stay healthy? A few things you can try including [joining a CSA or farm share](http://www.learnvest.com/2013/07/the-csa-craze-is-it-really-worth-the-money/), which may help you save money, is relatively eco-friendly, and supports local small businesses trying to compete with Big Agra. It isn't always cheaper, sometimes it only costs less if you buy a larger share, so if you are single, consider splitting costs of bulk or large quantities of items with a neighbor or roommate. Shopping at places like Aldi or Costco could help you buy lots of nuts, whole grains, frozen wild caught fish, canned veggies, frozen veggies, olives, oils, and legumes for cheap. Local delis and Asian and Mexican grocery stores also often have more affordable produce and dried goods, and you might have a local ‚Äúbulk foods‚Äù store that offers good products for less.\n\nOther lifestyle factors:\n\n* ‚Å†**Yoga.** Just 10-20 minutes per day can help curb your stress and inflammatory response, promote mental health, promote insulin sensitivity, and keep fit. A study recently suggested that it‚Äôs quite effective for PCOS symptoms in general! I really like this [quick 15 minute morning yoga routine ](https://youtu.be/H4B3xSCpEfo)which was shown to be effective in managing PCOS. The whole Live Fertile channel is good, as is Yoga With Adrienne.\n* ‚Å†**Exercise!** Research indicates that most people with PCOS find HIIT is super effective to reduce insulin resistance. But a few find it actually makes their stress and inflammatory response worse. [Figure out which one you are](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYW_vOMvY2z/?utm_medium=copy_link) and choose whether to do HIIT or more moderate cardio based on that. Choose exercises that you actually enjoy and find fun because otherwise you aren‚Äôt going to keep it up. A vigorous dance party in the kitchen while you wait for your food to bake counts.\n* ‚Å†**Self-care.** Bubble baths, soothing music, orgasms, meditation, dance, laugh. The whole ‚Äúlive, laugh, love‚Äù vibe is good for you! Schedule it in advance or put it on your to-do lists so you‚Äôre more likely to take this seriously. If you‚Äôre libido is depressed, read up on how to keep the fire going with the excellent [Come As You Are](https://www.amazon.com/Come-You-Are-Surprising-Transform/dp/1476762090) by Dr. Emily Nagoski, which is very well-researched and well-written.\n* ‚Å†Remember that **cortisol and androgens are highest in the mornings**. Circadian rhythms are to blame. You can time your supplements and yoga accordingly to maximize their effects\n* ‚Å†Practice good **sleep hygiene**!!! We are more prone to insomnia, apnea, and poor quality sleep. Which is terrible because sleep helps us regulate stress hormones, reproductive hormones and insulin. [Here‚Äôs more information!](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene)\n* ‚Å†If **acne** is keeping you down: moisturizer, SPF, lactic acid, differin, niacinamide and vitamin C have all done wonders for my acne AND anti-aging. I also spot-treat with a sulfur clay mask and that‚Äôs helpful! You can also go to [r/skincareaddiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction/) more detailed and personalized advice. Just make sure not to let them panic you about wrinkles, frown lines and pores. Sometimes they get wayyyy too upset about normal, healthy, human-looking skin. You can also ask your doctor for a referral to a dermatologist. Many of us find that low-glycemic anti-inflammatory diets help regulate the hormones that contribute to acne, so keep that in mind, too.\n* ‚Å†NOT for everyone but **CBD or marijuana** can help with inflammation and stress. Maybe worth a try if you can afford it and it‚Äôs legal. Don't worry about it if you'd rather not.\n* **Journal** to track your symptoms and habits! Not only will it help you remember to get things done, but collecting data on your PCOS is so empowering and can help \"crack the code\" of what works for you.\n* **Read up!** [Some books that might be helpful.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/s42tgo/books_information_and_help/hsp4awu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\nWhat are the things YOU wish you'd known?

Including not eating gluten, soy, coffee, and nightshades (it was rough - I love nightshades). I ate plenty of veggies. I cut down carbs. I ate veggies first for most meals. Limited caffeine and alcohol. \n\nWhile at that moment my period was pretty normal - my insulin levels were still elevated at 15. I was working out 4 days a week, walking a mile to work each way, and super active (biking everywhere I didn‚Äôt walk). I lost about 3 pounds over two months. \n\nIt was pretty disappointing to find that it all didn‚Äôt help on the scale even though I was counting calories and doing plenty of moderate intensity exercise.  \n\nI also learned that dairy and gluten didn‚Äôt seem to bother my system and I didn‚Äôt have any issues when I returned them to my diet.  \n\nNow I know that I still hadn‚Äôt solved the insulin issues.  I have learned more about managing my glucose since, but my body is extra picky.  And it seems that I really do need all of the medications and supplements - in addition to the healthy habits. So the message is don‚Äôt feel bad if all-natural lifestyle changes only don‚Äôt work for you.",

I'm also reading a great book for better understanding hormones and help with pcos: PERIOD REPAIR MANUAL by Lara Briden ND . \nI just wanted to put one thing out there as everybody in this PCOS space seems to recommend inositol/ ovasitol. I took it for about 4 months I believe, I started at a 1/4 dose and everytime I would try gltp bump up the dose I would have negative symptoms. A few months in a row I noticed it was making my cycle late, and it actually wouldn't come on unless I stopped taking the inositol. The last time this happened, I completely stopped taking it and still had to wait another 20 days (total 40+) before I saw my cycle. And mind you, before inositol I had regular periods like clock work. I've been told I have a milder form of pcos, and have had regular cycles for many years, so maybe it wasn't the right supplement for me.

She is a doctor and collected a lot of helpful information about PCOS and period based on scientific evidence.\n\nThe main therapy she suggests is *cyclic progesterone therapy*. It helps if you have anovulatory cycles due to elevated LH (in which case vitex might worsen your symptoms). It helps your natural cycle to get back on track by adding progesterone when it would be naturally produced if you ovulated. Taking bioidentical progesterone is not harmful if you have low progesterone levels (estrogen dominance).\n\nI started this therapy and it immediately helped. I felt better, had good sleep, calm, relaxed mood, less stress and less period pain. It did not cause any bad side effects. And my next cycle was so much better! Minimal spotting and normal cycle length as opposed to my previous long and irregular cycles with 2 weeks of heavy spotting midtime.\nI consulted with an endocrinologist and she agreed to everything I learned from Lara Briden's advice.",

    "body": "Warning this will be a long post, it has everything I've learnt in the past couple of years from hair growth, to styling, to weightloss, to nervous system regulation and more.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, I have 3B hair, tall, two years ago I was obese, prediabetic, I had anxiety problems, now I'm just a tall \\[seemingly ;) \\] effortlessly pretty black girl and I want all my beauties on here to have my beauty secrets.\n\nTopics discussed:\n\n* Haircare\n* Style\n* Makeup \n* Teeth\n* Skincare\n* Weight loss vs Fat loss\n* Healthy Fat loss\n* Body Recomposition \n* Inflammation\n* Gut Health\n* How to lower androgen/testosterone levels\n* Nervous System Regulation/Stress Management \n* Tea Cycling\n* Seed Cycling \n\n# Hair\n\nI have PCOS so it affects my hair growth and causes hirsutism, basically male patterened facial hair and male patterned baldness.\n\n**Hair Growth:** Here is the true secret sauce to hair growth, stimulating your scalp. I do daily scalp massages with a bamboo brush (even the bristles are made of rounded bamboo) very gentle. This is the one I use: [Golab Beauty](https://golabbeauty.com/products/organic-bamboo-scalp-massager-hair-brush)  I do short strokes which prevents any tangles. Morning and Night. I then go in with a scalp serum, I use The Oui scalp serum but it costs a pretty penny. In the first yearish I used (The 'Ordinary' Haircare Growth Set Multi-Peptide Serum For Hair Density) which worked wonders and was cost effective. At nights I seal with any scalp oil that has rosemary oil. Sadly Mielle's formula no longer works for me, but As I Am rosemary oil has been working, I also like the Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Hair and Scalp Drops. For Washing my hair I suffer from sebaceous dermatitis which causes scaliness. Paradoxically my scalp is so oily which is what triggers the ezcema and develops the dry patches. Reversing my PCOS symptoms fixed this but what also helped was the Nizoral shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole. It's harsh so I do it once to twice a month at most and I always follow up with a moisturizing shampoo, and of course finish with a wash out conditioner & leave in conditioner.\n\n**Hair Retention:** This is the info we all know about preventing breakage but I'll include just in case. Hair growth happens in the scalp like said before but to retain that growth it's important to wear protective hairstyles (especially while asleep), a silk/satin bonnet or wrap, silk/satin pillowcase, do not let your hair air dry at night. There is debate about this but I've seen hair specialists and scientists say our hair is especially fragile when wet (especially curly/kinky hair). Therefore, we are much more prone to snags and breakage while our hair is wet. So going to bed make sure your hair is dried. If you're air drying your hair during the day try not to touch it too much  - as little manipulation as possible. Personally choose to diffuse/blow dry my hair and this has prevented most of the breakage I was previously experiencing. Lastly, moisturize and oil your ends. I won't pretend like I know which order is best or even if it's important but I've found that using hair moisturizer/diluted leave in conditioner then hair oil works best for me.\n\n**Hirsutism/Facial Hair:** Spearmint essential oil. I add 1-2 drops of the oil to my moisturizer each time I put on my moisturizer and it helped A LOT with reducing my facial hair. I also drink a lot of spearmint tea. Spearmint specifically has been proven to lower androgen/testosterone levels which is why it helps. I also took supplements which I'll include at the end because they served multiple purposes. Be sure not to add the oil to the entire bottle because that will ruin your moisturizer's formula. Just add the drops in your palm/finger tips and mix in your face cream each time you moisturize your jawline, chin, underneck. Also, do this after moisturizing the upper part of your face without the oil because it's harsh and the scent can be irritating to your eye area.\n\n**Body hair:** Personally I sugar wax my arms and legs, the hair has grown back so thin now. I make it myself and follow tutorials from abetweene on youtube.\n\n**Hair colour/Hairstyle:** This will depend on your face shape and color season. I'm a dark winter colour season and I have a heart face shape. I used the Dressika app to discover my color season before I could afford to get myself professionally assessed and I got the same results. Just be sure to use natural lighting, like by a window. Once you have your colour season you can choose hair colours that work best for you (although natural almost always works best). For my hairstyle I try to choose styles that compliment my heart shaped face. I used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with figuring this out.\n\n# Style\n\nI think most of us know about **Kibbe and colour seasons.** This was how I upgraded my wardrobe. I'm a soft dramatic so I wear things that work for my tall height and accentuate my waist.\n\nThis was the game changer with colour seasons. Most of us know about our true seasons, but it can get restrictive. Sister seasons and colour dissonance is also helpful to know.\n\nMy colour season is dark winter, so my sister seasons would be dark autumn and true winter. Thid gives me more wiggle room to style myself.\n\n**Dissonance** are colours that are outside your true season and your sister seasons, you sprinke this in to add interest. Think of an outfit that is extremely matchy and cohesive but has that one accessory or item that stands out and adds interest. It's really fun in art and in fashion.\n\nFor my **shoes** I've started wearing dancing heels which help my flat feet lol and look stylish. Heel insoles help too, as well as the product Shoe Gummi. I still can't last more than 2, 3 hours at most but it's definitely bearable compared to before.\n\nMatching pajamas and loungewear. You just feel so luxurious dressing up at home and they can (should) be comfy :)\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* I wear glasses that work with my heart shaped face.\n* I have a neutral leaning warm undertone so I wear gold jewelry, if I wear pearls or other gem stones I mix in gold to provide more harmony with my skin.\n* Perfume, wear what works with your body chemistry. Some smell delictable on people I know and icky on me, and vice versa. Wear what works for you.\n* Nails, press ons. So convenient, so cheap.\n* Hair accessories, bows, barretes, clips, scrunchies, a ribbon, you could be wearing jeans and a t shirt but a simple hair accessory upgrades the look automatically.\n\n# Makeup\n\nI used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with finding eye looks, brows, blush placement for my face shape\n\nI have a low visual weight face and I am a romantic ingenue, because of this I go for more subtle looks that emphasis two facial features maximum at a time (eyes, lips, cheeks).\n\nDon't get me wrong I love glam bold makeup but soft and subtle makes me glow, I turn heads when my makeup is done like this.\n\n# Teeth\n\n* Wax free floss (Cocofloss $10 expensive but I love it üòÖ, Burst black floss, Moon graphite floss, Twice floss, Dr. Jen‚Äôs silk floss)\n* Oil pulling (coconut oil with clove & tea tree oil, or Guru Nanda oil pulling product)\n* Brush teeth\n* Tongue scraper (not everyday, couple of times a week and not too hard)\n* Alcohol free mouthwash (TheraBreath)\n* More so related to my lip area but I try to use wrinkle preventing straws or when I do use regular straws, I place it on the side of my mouth. The reason this works is because puckering the lips excessively causes smokers lines/wrinkles around the mouth. \n\n# Skin\n\nSkincare. This was something that took me a while to work on because of my PCOS, age, weight and etc.\n\n**Facial Care:** The basics includes chemical exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover. I cycle my nightly skincare routine with this in mind and always keep the same morning routine. Mornings look like this (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, vitamin c/peptide serum, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, finish with sunscreen).\n\nMy nights I alternate these routines in this order\n\nNight 1 - Chemical Exfoliation (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, glycolic/lactic acid, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire face, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\n*Repeat Night 1 - 3 (sometimes I need more days to recover if my skin is sensitive or acting up, do what works for you personally)*\n\nOther things that I've done/used to help: red light therapy (helps with both hair growth, so I use it on my scalp, and with stretch marks so I use it on my face and body), Microcurrent device (helps with collagen production and stretchmarks) - I use the brand NuFace & NuBody, Volufiline (a skin serum I mix with eye cream that helps with hollowness under the eyes, Kigelia Africana Skin Cream (I use the brand Maelys B-Perky which contains this ingredient and helped to tighten my chest area and my loose skin on the area),  face yoga and myo fascia face massage, these help with the tautness of my face (basically everything else helps with wrinkles, these exercises and the microcurrent helps and prevents, sagging especially jowls). I follow tutorials I search for from youtube.\n\n**Body Care:** Similar to facial care body care includes exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover\n\nNight 1 - Physical Exfoliation (Dry brush/Body Scrub, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, retinol body wash, retinol body lotion)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\n*Again, repeat Night 1 - 3 use more days for recovery if needed*\n\n**Stretch marks/loose skin:** Whether due to weight gain, pregnancy, etc. we can't ever truly get rid of loose skin or stretch marks but moisturizing the skin and derma rolling can help with the appearance. Especially derma rolling. Do NOT derma roll while pregnant but you can do so after when you‚Äôve recovered and talk to your doctor (if you've had a c section you have to wait before derma rolling). I used this video as motivation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A)\n\nFor the body I never went beyond 1.5mm it worked for my deepest stretch marks. If this is too aggressive 1.0mm still works just as well. Make sure you use 70% alcohol as this is what experts say is better at disinfecting. It has more water, which helps it to dissolve more slowly, penetrate cells, and kill bacteria. The disinfecting power of rubbing alcohol drops at concentrations higher than 80%-85%. Make sure you disinfect the derma roller before and after use, and make sure you disinfect your area of contact before rolling as well. Do not do heavy workouts workout or sweat inducing activities for at least 3 days after and avoid harsh products.\n\nI started derma rolling while working on losing weight (at the beginning of my journey while still obese) and continued a year after losing 130lbs. Derma rolling works by causing micro tears, the skin heals the area and in the process of doing so develops more collagen - leading to thicker skin, lighter stretch marks and tighter skin. Since I did this before losing the weight it helped my skin adapt a lot. I won't pretend like I have 0 loose skin or stretch marks but it's barely visible. Someone has to be intimately close to notice. Obviously genetics, how slowly you lose the weight, diet, and moisturizing the skin helps but my PCOS contributed to low collagen (thin skin) and so the derma rolling really helped.\n\n# Weight loss vs Fat loss\n\n**Tons of info here but I promise if you read through it helps to know this stuff.**\n\nWeightloss comes down to calories in versus calories out. I know that's rudely simpliflied and not that easy, but it truly is the answer to **weightloss** (which may be fat, water, or muscle). This is why people can eat barely nothing, lose weight but their shape stays the same (basically skinny fat). It's also why fasting or going low carb works so fast (water weight is the first to go).\n\nFatloss on the other hand is more complicated. This involves our TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).\n\nTDEE includes: Resting/Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Metabolic Equivalent of Task or Exercise activity thermogenesis  (EAT), Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), and Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT).\n\n**BMR (\\~70% daily energy)** the energy taken to exist, so tasks like breathing. Your sex, body composition (muscle to fat ratio), age, and genetics play a role in this  \n**EAT (\\~5% daily energy)** the energy taken for exercise weight lifting, swimming, high intensity walks, etc.  \n**NEAT (\\~15% daily energy)** the energy taken for non exercise movements like walking, fidgeting, showering, standing, etc  \n**TEF (\\~10% daily energy depending on the macronutrients of your meal)** the energy taken to digest, protein has the highest TEF of all the macronutrients, Carbs have a TEF of around 5-10%, while Fats have the lowest TEF, around 0-3%.\n\n**Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT)** is the changes in energy expenditure (energy used) that occur in response to changes in energy balance. For example when you eat more food than you need, your body may increase energy expenditure to prevent weight gain eg. move more, eat less the next day, etc.. On the other hand, when you eat less food than you need, your body may decrease energy expenditure to conserve energy and prevent weight loss eg. less movement, eat more the next day.\n\nOther things that affect AT include diet composition (eg high/low protein, high/low carb, calorie dense foods, etc), physical activity (eg. weights vs. cardio), and environmental factors such as temperature and altitude.\n\nThings that influence AT can make weight management challenging, as it can lead to plateaus or rebounds in weight loss efforts. This is why lack of sleep, hormonal issues, aging, etc. makes weightloss harder.\n\n*Here is a clearer example of this*\n\nThings that affect calories in:\n\n* 8-9 Hours of sleep (Maintains metabolic homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, hormonal processes). Compromised sleep lead to:\n   * Increased Gherlin (hunger hormone - feeling hungrier & therefor eating more)\n   * Decreased Leptin (sensation of satiety - needing to eat more to feel full)\n* Insulin resistance: This is when the cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from your blood. This results in excessive sugar in the blood & as a result the body produces more insulin in order to try to help the cells obtain the energy from glucose. This leads to weight gain as the insulin increases hunger. Also, since the body is insulin resistant, the excess glucose is converted to fat for long-term storage.\n   * Things that can cause insulin resistance: PCOS, Inactivity/sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, poor sleep habits, high cholesterol levels, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, high bodyweight, acromegaly\n\nThings that affect calories out:\n\n* Body Composition (Fat to muscle ratio) \n* Gut health\n* Compromised sleep affects our energy levels which leads to\n   * Decreased NEAT (Non exercise activity thermogenesis)\n* Hypothyroidism (lowered levels of T3¬†and T4)\n   * Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 affects every cell and all the organs in your body by regulating the rate at which your body uses calories/energy which is known as our bmr, meaning this affects your metabolic rate.\n* Too few calories lowers daily NEAT\n   * By eating below your BMI (calories needed to perform basic biological processes), your body makes up for this through energy conservation by lowering your NEAT (non exercise activity thermogenesis). Basically you lack the energy to perform your normal daily activities. This also affects your body composition and cardio health as you become sedentary (stop moving as much).\n\n# Healthy Fat loss\n\nSo to lose fat in a healthy way you need to:\n\n1. Get enough sleep (8-9 hours per night)\n2. **Manage your stress levels/nervous system regulation**\n3. **Look after your gut health**\n4. **Manage inflammation**\n5. Increase your daily steps (8-10k per day)\n6. **Weight lift**\n7. **Eat high protein (protein takes the most amount of energy to digest).**\n8. **Manage your insulin resistence**\n9. **Eat in a caloric deficit (make sure your calories in do not exceed calories out).**\n\nFuther information about the bold items in the list is included below. Also, I know this all seems overwhelming but keep in mind you are creating a lifestyle change. This is not a quick fix. \n\nTo **manage your insulin resistance** (info from the book Glucose Goddess by Jessie Inchausp√©):\n\n* Eat within an hour of waking up\n* Protein with breakfast\n* Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before each meal (diluted in a glass of water)\n* Eat foods in this order, veggies -> protein -> fat -> starches -> carbs -> sugar\n* Never eat sweets/dessert/carbs on an empty stomach (dessert after dinner)\n* Keep refined carbs and added sugar at a minimum.\n* Minimize alcohol intake\n* Try to minimize sodas, fruit juice and sweet drinks (this is because there is no fiber to help with the glucose spike or at least try to have these drinks after eating something fiberous)\n* Only eat fruit whole, not transformed eg. eat the orange instead of having the orange juice, again fiber makes a world of a difference\n* Put clothing on your carbs. Eg. have protein/fats/fiber with your carbs\n* A short walk after carb heavy meals\n* Fasting - this is controversial and I should add a disclaimer, if you in any way shape or form have or had an eating disorder, especially restrictive eating, I highly recommend against fasting. Intermittent fasting has a lot of studies out there that were done on men. The book Fast Like a Girl by Dr. Mindy Pelz includes a nuanced view of fasting that takes into account our hormones and our monthly cycle. She also has a free app 'Fast like a girl', you log your period and it tells you how long to fast. However, bioindividuality is key here, genetics, etc. Please if you are considering fasting make sure you get bloodwork done first. Manage your electrolyte levels, do not neglect iron and protein levels. Personally, I prefer using the other methods since fasting can also inadvertently worsens insulin resistence due to increased stress/cortisol which cause higher hunger cues. Some with insulin resistence found fasting to be helpful. So make sure you do what works for you and always consult your doctor. \n* Supplements:\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n   * Inositol\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\nTo eat in a **caloric deficit**, calculate your TDEE and subtract 200-500 calories from that number. I like using this calculator.   \n[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net)\n\nEg. If it's calculated to be 2000 calories, you subtract 200, so 1800 should be your daily calorie intake. For the activity levels make sure you do not oversell yourself. Here is a general guide:\n\n* Sedentary: Office job sat all day or less than 3000 steps per day\n* Lightly Active: Exercise 1-3 times per week or 3-10k steps daily (up to 3-4 miles daily)\n* Moderately Active: Exercise 3-5 times per week or 10-15k steps daily (up to 4-7 miles daily)\n* Highly Active: Hard exercise 6-7 training days per week or 15-20k steps daily (up to 7-10 miles daily)\n* Extremely Active: Intense daily exercise/hard physical labour 7 days a week or 25k+ steps daily (up to 10 miles daily)\n\nAs you lose weight your body adapts so after a while you may need to recalculate your TDEE and deficit. Once you are at your ideal weight, you no longer subtract the 200-500, you simply eat the TDEE amount to maintain but you do this gradually. After I lost the weight I came out of the deficit by adding 50 calories to my daily intake per week, till I was at maintenance/my TDEE. This prevented me from gaining fat or water weight.\n\nLastly, muscle mass (increase in muscle raises your metabolic level, meaning you burn more calories at rest). This is ideal and is also how you'll see someone who is short, seemingly small but weigh more than you imagined. Muscle density weighs more than fat. Think of a 50 pound dumbbell versus 50 pounds of feathers, you would need a whole lot of feathers to match the weight. Same difference, you need a larger volume of fat to equal to the same amount of muscle. Therefore, lifting weights is ideal because you will become more toned, burn more calories at rest, be able to eat more even when you've lost the weight to maintain your phisique, you'll be more insulin sensitive, and you will have stronger and higher bone density (really important for women, we lose up to 5% of muscle mass per decade after the age of 30).\n\n# Body Recompositon: Weightlifting for health (and aesthetics), lose fat & gain muscle\n\nIt is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. I followed Huskular Goddess and and LexiiGettingFit for inspiration and they were really the ones that opened my eyes to the concept of body recomposition (gain musle while losing fat). \n\nThe benefits of this is as you're getting smaller your TDEE is increasing. This means by the time you lose the weight you'll still be eating an adequate amount. The other benefits include insulin sensitivity versus insulin resistence, higher metabolism, and a improved body composition like I mentioned before in the dummbell versus feather example. The downside is the number on the scale won't have a dramatic shift while your clothes will be fitting looser. Again, weight density plays tricks on us and it's easy to get caught up in body dismorphia but I promise it works. \n\nIn order to sustain and build muscle while losing fat, you need to be consuming enough protein while remaining in a caloric deficit. So 60-80g of protein per day minimum to lose 1-2lbs per week. Ideally it should be 0.8-1g of per pound of lean body mass. Eg, someone is 300lbs and they want to get down to 150lbs. They would eat 120-150g of protein per day. If this is too much, try to get at least 60-80g like I mentioned before. Remember even though 1-2lbs per week sounds small, the changes are significant because of the muscle gained. You will look and feel smaller.  \n\n**Weightlifting for a rounder booty** (I reshaped my glutes by weightlifting. Hormones can actually affect the shape and my PCOS did a number on me. I developed a V shape over the years. Round, square, heart, A shapes are all based on your bone structure and fat placement. Some of us just have those stubborn fat deposits in certain areas that are genetic, even when we lose the weight, it's a smaller version but the same shape. V shape on the other hand is largely seen in older women post menopause and in younger women with hormonal disorders. This is becuase the hormonal imbalances also causes muscle imbalances. Regulating your hormones helps but it won't grow the muscles for you, so I used Fit With Emely's glute guide based on your glute shape (completely free, I watched all her videos to get this info and it took me two years to go from a V shape to a round shape.\n\nHere is the guideline for each shape:\n\n**Glute Maximus** - Everyone should be working on glute maximus. It builds the shelf and overall size. Step ups (all variations), hip thrusts (all variations), lunges, rdl, leg press, all squat variations  \n**Glute Minimus** - (V and Square shapes), this muscle fills in the middle between the top and lower glute. Hip abduction, single leg bridge, Standing hip abduction/cable raises  \n**Gute Medius** - (Heart, Round, and A-shaped) this muscles builds a longer hip for top portion of the glutes. Eg. Single leg squat, Single leg deadlift, Cable clamshells, Reverse lung, step ups  \n**Underbutt** - Everyone should be working on underbutt but this is especially useful for V shaped folks. It works the hamstrings and lower portion of glutes. Good mornings, single leg rdl (also works minimus), single leg hip thrust (also works maximus), hip abductors (also works minimus)\n\nHow to structure workout:\n\n* Warm up/Dynamic Stretches (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body warm up or upper body warm up, etc.)\n* Compound exercises (2-3 exercises eg. single leg rdl, good mornings, leg press - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets). That probably sounds like a foreign language to some, so for instance:\n   * **Start excercise 1**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 2**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 3**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n* Secondary Workouts (2-3 exercises eg. step ups, bulgarian split squats, lunges - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets)\n* Isolated/Accessory Movements: these exercises work one part of the muscle more than others, for example an overbias on the underbutt/hamstring like I mentioned before to help with the V shape ( eg. hip abductors, kickbacks, glute bridge, lying leg raises, etc. (1-2 exercises high repetitions, low weight 2-3 sets, 15-20 reps, 1-2 minute rest between sets)\n* Static stretch/cool down (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body cool down or upper body cool down, etc.)\n\nKeep in mind that you only need to work on a muscle group 2-3 times a week. So I only do glutes Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Also keep in mind while I work the lower body I am also working my upper body (eg. while doing rdls I am lifting the weight with my upper body), which is why I don't have tailered upper body days, this is for aesthetic reasons, and because weightlifting more than 3 days per week is not feasible with my PCOS. \n\nMy full routine is:\n\n* Monday- lower body\n* Tuesday - Pilates/core\n* Wednesday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n* Thursday - lower body\n* Friday - Pilates/core\n* Saturday - lower body\n* Sunday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n\nI also used primarily resistance bands in the beginning because gym equipment intimidated me (not anymore :) ). I started with 25lb resistance and went up to 125lbs. I use the product BandBar which allowed me to use the resistance bands like a barbell at home. This isn‚Äôt the only option and you can definitely buy resistance bands and do it without the bar. [BandBar](https://shopbandbar.com)\n\nFor the ab separation from being obese, I did this workout 3 times a week (also helpful post pregnancy): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0)\n\nFor my chest to help with getting perkier boobs (the derma rolling was what made the biggest difference, but this exercise helped as well though it took 6+ months for the changes to be significant. Women tend to take longer to grow chest muscles): [https://youtu.be/hg7\\_R29jGIE?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/hg7_R29jGIE?feature=shared)\n\nI also did workouts to help with my posture and mobility 3 times a week (any I could find online)\n\nThe last thing I will say is be mindful that you may gain weight initially when you start lifting weights. This is due to slight inflammation/water gain from foreign tension, which will last about a month or two before you adapt BUT your body will adapt, I promise. Keep in mind if it's days before your period or if you are on your period. It's not if, but when, our weight fluctuates. As long as you are in a deficit and doing everything right, the number will go down. Do not get discouraged!!!\n\n***Here is the edit to this post which includes my supplements, how I managed my inflammation, and how I improved my gut health. I also edited the information I shared prior to include a few more tips and lifestyle changes I made, and included a few more details. I also rearranged things so there is a separation between style/hair/skin and health information. The post is getting really long so I may create a separate post for personal development/mindset tips.*** \n\n# Inflammation\n\nIn my case my inflammation was caused by my PCOS, insulin resistence and my obesity, but it can be caused by chronic stress, other autoimmune disorders like IBS, Crohn's disease, etc, smoking/alcohol, age related diseases, environmental toxins, diets high in processed foods, sugars, trans fats & high omega-6 fatty acids. \n\nIn my case the inflammation from the PCOS led to gut inflammation due to the high levels of coritsal (stress hormones) in reaction to the high testosterone and insulin resistence. I also experienced metabolic inflammation (non alcoholic fatty liver disease), skin inflammation (as I mentioned earlier the ezcema on my scalp, alopecia, and hirsutism), adipose tissue inflammation, chronic low grade inflammation (this led to edema or fuid retention -> insulin resistance and my high testosteron/androgen levels also exacerbated this).\n\nTo fix this these were the thin I added to my life:\n\n* Dry brushing 2-3 times a week\n* Body Gua sha\n* Face Gua Sha or Face Yoga or Myofascial Massage \n* Jump Rope\n* Trampoline/Rebounder\n* Vibration Plate (very useful for after a workout or while sitting down)\n* Acupressure mat\n* Arvigo (Mayan Abdominal massage) & Lymphatic drainage massage\n* Leg elevation, I sleep with a pillow under my knees. In the evenings I keep my legs up.\n* Massages\n* Sweat more (exercise/sauna/steam room)\n* Portable Infrared Sauna (reduce cortisol by 25%)\n* Microcurrent\n* Compression socks\n* Castor oil pack 3-4x per week\n* Eliminate inflammatory triggers (mine were gluten & dairy)\n   * Switch to sourdough\n   * Eliminate seed oils\n   * Avoid alcohol & smoking\n* Supplements\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n* Teas that helped\n   * Turmeric\n   * Red Rasberru Leaf Tea\n   * Fennel\n   * Chamomile\n\n# Gut Health \n\nYour microbiota needs the right bacteria in the right amount to perform its hormone regulating functions properly. When the type or number of bacteria gets disturbed by events such as¬†stress, or poor diet, or your gut can no longer accomplish its job meaning you'll have inflammation, increased risk of chronic disease, skin conditions, mental health issues, weakened immune system, nutrient absorprion problems, and weight management challenges.   \n\n\nFor weight loss issues, gut microbiomes influence hormones in producing and signaling leptin and ghrelin (these hormones regulate hunger and fullness signals). Inflammation and insulin resistence is also associated with gut health problems as mentioned before. Energy extraction from foods, certain gut bacteria are more efficient at extracting energy from food, particularly carbohydrates. When there is an imbalance, more calories can be absorbed from food leading to difficulties gaining or losing weight. \n\nThings I did to improve gut health/intestinal permeability:\n\n* Ate foods rich in digestive enzymes (mangoes, pineapple, etc.)\n* Pre and probiotics (incorporate bifidobacterium and lactobacillus)\n   * Favorite brand: Seed Heath Probiotics\n* Pickles (without vinegar): Great source of prebiotics\n* Apple Cider Vinegar/Kimchi/Kombucha/Sauerkraut\n   * Beware of certain types of vinegar contain chemicals which kill bacteria, ‚Äúthe good bacteria‚Äù, and leave the yeast Candida albicans alone.\n   * Raw apple cider vinegar contains: Natural probiotics (friendly bacteria), which may help with your immune system and gut health.\n      * Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (diluted in a glass of water) before each meal\n   * Balsamic vinegar: Acetic acid is the active compound in balsamic vinegar. This acid contains strains of probiotics that aid digestion. The probiotics found in acetic acid can help promote good gut health and digestion while supporting overall immune function.\n* Raw Carrots (has the type of fiber that binds and flushes out toxins in gut, good to have as daily hormone & digestion support)\n* Limit Processed foods and Sugar\n* No drinking or smoking \n* Stress managment (which I'll expand on just below)\n* Increase fiber intake\n* Regularly exercise\n* Supplements\n   * Ginger \n   * L-Glutamine\n   * Olive leaf extract (especially helpful if you have candida overgrowth)\n   * Turmereric \n* Teas\n   * Ginger\n   * Lemon Balm\n\n# Lower androgens/testosterone\n\n* Teas \n   * Nettle Tea\n   * Spearmint tea\n* Spearmint oil topically for hirsutism\n* Supplements\n   * Schisandra (adaptogen - stress management & hormone balance)\n   * Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n   * Inositol\n   * Holy Basil\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\n# Nervous System Regulation/ Stress Management \n\nStress is one of the things that age us the most, and people with PCOS already have higher levels of cortisol so these are the things I do to manage my stress levels:\n\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, direct sunlight upon waking up.

Seed cycling refers to the consumption of specific seeds at different times of the month in order to improve the production and levels of sex hormones, specifically estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.\n\nSeed cycling divides the female menstrual cycle into two parts:\n\n1. During the first half of the menstrual cycle, or days 1 through 14, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **flax and pumpkin seeds.**\n2. During the second half of the menstrual cycle, or days 15 through 28, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **sunflower and sesame seeds**\n\n*Results from seed cycling will not happen overnight. Normally women observe improvements after approximately three months of seed cycling adherence. It took me about 4ish months.*\n\n**The Benefits of Seed Cycling:** Support hormonal balance, alleviate PMS symptoms, decrease hormonal acne, alter irregularity of menstrual cycles, and fight stomach bloating and fatigue.\n\n",

    "body": "I really really wish I had before and after photos to share but when I started my routine, my expectations were so low that I didn‚Äôt think it was worth it. I mostly started doing this routine because I‚Äôm pregnant for the first time and have a lot of time on my hands. I also hoped I would prevent existing stretch marks from worsening if I gained weight during my pregnancy. \n\nAnyway, I‚Äôve had stretch marks on my knees and inner thighs since I went through puberty. They started out red/purple when I was teenager but have long turned white and I just figured there was nothing to be done about them. The ones on my inner thighs never bothered me a ton but I admit, I‚Äôve always hated the ones on my knees since it doesn‚Äôt seem as common to have them there. \n\nAnyway, four months ago, I started a routine of microneedling, using lactic acid, vitamin e oil, and red light therapy. Basically I microneedle the problem areas and then apply a small amount of lactic acid to the area. Then I use my Current Body red light mask (which is for the face but it‚Äôs bendable so I just make it work) on each area for 10 minutes (so 40 minutes total). Afterwards I use a thick, sticky vitamin E oil/serum. \n\nI swear, my stretch marks are all but gone. I couldn‚Äôt be happier, especially about the improvement with my knees. I really started doing this with very little hope and mostly out of boredom. I‚Äôm not sure which part of the routine has helped the most or if it‚Äôs the combination but I just wanted to share. \n\nI haven‚Äôt gained any new stretch marks yet in pregnancy (27 weeks currently) but if they start popping up, I‚Äôll definitely attack them with my amateur routine.\n\nETA: the stretch marks, specifically the ones on my knees went through a short period where it almost seemed like they were getting worse before they got better. They went from white back to the reddish/purple color they were when they first appeared as a teen. I also thought I‚Äôd note that if I weren‚Äôt pregnant, I‚Äôd have probably used tret on and off as well. I think tret could probably do a lot of good in combination with microneedling. I might also opt for glycolic acid over lactic acid but I just happened to have the lactic acid already but I‚Äôve read glycolic might work better.",

    "body": "*Pain is Nature's way of saying, \"Don't do that.\"*  \n*Endorphins are humanity‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúHold my beer.‚Äù*\n\n-----------------\n\nThis story takes place in The Conclave Universe, which includes [The Human Race](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3x9acz/the_human_race_part_1/) and [The Food of the Gods](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5jqcy1/pi_the_food_of_the_gods_part_1/), which I should get around to finishing at some point. Go ahead and read them if you like, but neither are required reading for this story.\n \n-----------------\n \n**A conversation between two Lix xenoculturalists, 8 months after first contact with humans‚Ä¶**\n \nDem Arr: There's something strange about these humans, Laz.\n \nLaz Keff: So you keep saying, Dem.\n \nD: I know, but I mean I found a specific thing that's strange about them.\n \nL: So there's another specific strange thing. Humans are strange. We've already established that.\n \nD: No, I mean I think I found the strange thing that explains all the other strange things.\n \nL: Oh. Well, yeah. That would be something. Is it something we can publish?\n \nD: Maybe. Can I run it by you?\n \nL: Go.\n \nD: Okay. First, the one thing they brag about all the time.\n \nL: Capsaicin?\n \nD: Yeah. You've heard the joke, *\"What did the human say to the apex predator that was about to eat him?\"*\n \nL: *\"Careful, I just ate some food with capsaicin in it.\"* Yeah, they're always warning us about how their food contains capsaicin, as if it might be toxic to us. I've had their food. It's pretty good.\n \nD: But not harmful to us, right. Humans go out of their way to warn us about capsaicin in their food. Some of them think it's funny. But most of them are serious about it, like they're warning us to prevent, like, a diplomatic incident.\n \nL: So why do they warn us? Do their dogs have a reaction to it? Other animals on Earth?\n \nD: Maybe, I don't know. But what I found out is, it causes a reaction in *them*.\n \nL: In humans? Like, it's toxic to them?\n \nD: No, it doesn't do any damage, just some inflammation. In very high doses, the inflammation itself causes issues, but there's no direct toxicity. It works by binding to certain receptors and lowering their sensitivity to heat. So if a human eats something with capsaicin in it, their mouth feels like it's burning. But it's not actually burning.\n \nL: Why do they put it in their food then?\n \nD: Exactly. So that's exhibit A.\n \nL: But-\n \nD: We'll get back to it. There's video, too.\n \nL: Ok. Exhibit B?\n \nD: Ok, you heard about the [Pax Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3x9acz/the_human_race_part_1/) last month?\n \nL: That race the human won? It set a new record for the 11 kilometer race by a few minutes or something.\n\n*[Translator‚Äôs note: Time and distance units in the original have been converted to Earth equivalent.]*\n \nD: It would have broken the record by a lot more, but it showed up to the race 90 minutes late.\n \nL: What? Wait, so it ran 11 kilometers in...\n \nD: Less than an hour.\n \nL: 11 kilometers in less than an hour? Stars! Is it like a super-athlete or something?\n \nD: No, that's the thing. It's not an athlete. It was part of the human diplomatic corps. It registered a couple days before the race, basically on a whim. Get this: their fastest runners could do it in half the time.\n \nL: *Half?* You're joking!\n \nD: No, seriously. I have video of this too.\n \nL: But humans aren't, like, strong or anything. They're kind of puny.\n \nD: It turns out they are actually built for running. They regularly have races much longer than the Pax Run. They evolved as persistence hunters. But there's more to it than that.\n \nL: How so?\n \nD: They're not that much stronger or more well-built for running than us, or, say, the Frin. But they're way faster, at least over longer distances. And they have races far longer than we would ever imagine. Physiology alone can't account for that.\n \nL: So you figured out what accounts for the performance gap?\n \nD: I think so.\n \nL: And it has something to do with eating capsaicin and simulating fire in their mouths?\n \nD: Ummm, well not directly... let's move on to exhibit C.\n \nL: This had better be going somewhere, Dem.\n \nD: It is, Laz. Trust me.\n \nL: Alright.\n \nD: Exhibit C is their reproductive practices.\n \nL: What about them?\n \nD: They do some strange things when it comes to reproduction.\n \nL: Well every species has different ways of attracting mates‚Ä¶\n \nD: No, this is after they‚Äôve attracted each other. You know that they derive pleasure from the reproductive act itself?\n \nL: Sure. An interesting adaptation, to be sure, but there are a few other Conclave species that do the same thing. The Koval-\n \nD: Yes, but do you know about the lengths they‚Äôll go to in order to enhance that pleasure?\n \nL: No, it‚Äôs hard enough just to get one of them to describe the process at all. Many of the ones I‚Äôve talked to seem to be ashamed of it.\n \nD: Yeah, nobody would go into detail with me, either. Until one of them told me where I could get a hold of some video.\n \nL: Oh, one of the scientists?\n \nD: No, it was one of the students that worked for the scientists. A young adult. Female. She sent me to a node on their computer network where humans can access videos of other humans performing their sex act.\n \nL: They watch each other? To learn the best reproductive technique?\n \nD: No, for pleasure, remember? They aren‚Äôt always doing this to reproduce.\n \nL: Oh right. Still, not that unusual.\n \nD: But you need to see this video. Here, look at my datapad.\n \nL: Stars, they‚Äôre ugly. Interesting uniform though. It exposes the very parts they usually keep covered. What is it holding?\n \nD: That, my good Laz, is an instrument of torture. See what it‚Äôs doing? That one‚Äôs a female. The one tied to the metal frame on the bed is a male.\n \nL: But wait, he‚Äôs tied up? Is he being held prisoner? He‚Äôs being tortured!\n \nD: No, eventually, in the video, they actually do their sex thing. It‚Äôs in like 20 minutes. This is called foreplay.\n \nL: It looks awful.\n \nD: But it‚Äôs not awful for them. Look, he just smiled a bit. Here, I‚Äôll turn on the captioning.\n \nL: She‚Äôs calling him her slave. Look, Dem, this is something we should tell their authorities about.\n \nD: No, Laz, I was actually told very specifically not to share this video by the female.\n \nL: The female in the video? You met her? Dem-\n \nD: She‚Äôs the student that told me about it. I met the male too. He‚Äôs fine, Laz, I assure you. He‚Äôs another student. He freely told me that this is something they participate in mutually. I followed the isolation protocols too, just to make sure he wasn‚Äôt under duress.\n \nL: But he‚Äôs clearly in pain.\n \nD: Ah! You‚Äôve got it Laz! That‚Äôs the key!\n \nL: Pain is the key?\n \nD: Yep! That‚Äôs why they put capsaicin in their food.\n \nL: Because it hurts?\n \nD: Because they derive pleasure from pain. It wasn‚Äôt until I saw this video that I figured it out. Look! The male is aroused.\n \nL: What possible use is there for deriving pleasure from pain? How would a neural reaction like that survive natural selection?\n \nD: You got me, Laz. But it explains so much about the humans, right?\n \nL: Well it explains why they put a chemical in their food that makes them think their mouths are on fire. You said you have a video of that, too?\n \nD: Yeah, I‚Äôll bring it up‚Ä¶\n \nL: No, let the torture video play. I want to see how that whole‚Ä¶ uh, performance‚Ä¶ plays out. Here, bring it up on my datapad.\n \nD: Ok, let me just‚Ä¶ ok, look, this one just ate something called a ‚ÄúCarolina Reaper‚Äù.\n \nL: He‚Äôs crying. Or wait, is he laughing?\n \nD: That‚Äôs right. A little of both, actually.\n \nL: So his eyes and nose have this flushing response, dumping stars know what all over his hideous face. But he likes it?\n \nD: I don‚Äôt know the exact mechanism, but look at him! He‚Äôs almost having a religious experience.\n \nL: Like that double rainbow guy?\n \nD: Even more than that.\n \nL: Is there any sexual response?\n \nD: Not that I can tell. Unless they put the capsaicin right on their genitals. We can find a video of that maybe-\n \nL: Well, wait though, what does this have to do with their running and breaking century old galactic records?\n \nD: Oh right! That was a little harder to link up. Okay, we‚Äôre done with mucous face. Here‚Äôs a video of one of their 42.2 kilometer races.\n \nL: *42.2 kilometers?* On just their legs?\n \nD: I know, it‚Äôs crazy. We‚Äôre just looking at the end here. Now, these aren‚Äôt elite runners. This is someone who does this for recreation. As a hobby.\n \nL: Is he bleeding? They bleed red, right?\n \nD: Yes, from his vestigial mammaries. They‚Äôre mostly non-functional in the males.\n \nL: Oh, the mammaries‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs sexually arousing for him to bleed from there?\n \nD: No, my understanding is that this is purely painful for them. No joy in it at all.\n \nL: Then why are you showing me?\n \nD: I just thought it was funny. Here‚Äôs another one. Okay this one is clearly hurting, right? Look at its face.\n \nL: Agony. Definitely struggling. Muscle fatigue in the legs?\n \nD: Right, but keep watching. Let me fast forward a bit‚Ä¶ okay. Same human here.\n \nL: This is later in the race?\n \nD: Yes.\n \nL: Are you sure? It looks much better here, like it was ‚Ä¶ this is a male right? He has a grin on his face here. Kind of zoning out, but his legs look stronger.\n \nD: Yeah, this is later in the race. He‚Äôs experiencing something called ‚Äúrunner‚Äôs high‚Äù. It occasionally happens, from what I was reading, when a runner pushes beyond their normal limits.\n \nL: So the pain from the muscles‚Ä¶\n \nD: They build up lactic acid when they‚Äôre not getting enough oxygen to the muscles.\n \nL: And that causes them pleasure?\n \nD: No, the lactic acid causes the pain. It's something else that causes the pleasure. Or not so much causes pleasure, as it causes them to be able to ignore the pain.\n \nL: Wow, that would give them quite an advantage.\n \nD: Right, but here‚Äôs the key. Okay fast forwarding, same runner, now finished. Look, bent over, clearly hurting right?\n \nL: Right.\n \nD: Now watch as he stands up.\n \nL: He‚Äôs smiling, laughing‚Ä¶ crying? Like mucous face!\n \nD: Just like mucous face. Look, that same wash of mixed emotions displayed on his face, just without nearly as much actual mucous. That‚Äôs the key to their running. They either ignore or draw strength from the pain. And that's why they can go so much farther and faster than anyone else, when it's coupled with their runner physiology.\n \nL: Very powerful adaptation. And what about the torture ceremony?\n \nD: Well, let‚Äôs see how far along they are‚Ä¶ oh.\n \nL: What? Oh.\n \nD: Sorry. That‚Äôs not mucous, by the way.\n \nL: They really are disgusting creatures, aren‚Äôt they?",

I really hate running. I wish I could hit running with this hammer. Gah, fuck you in particular, stupid tree!‚Äù Rex complained, tearing through underbrush and avoiding uneven ground as he did his best to reach the target location that the Event Horizon‚Äôs bridge crew had provided him. The forests of Mara, of course, cared not for his grousing, and continued to make his life miserable via trees, exposed roots, loose rocks, muddy ground, and all manner of annoyance that Cauthan hunters were forced to contend with day after day without the aid of a mothership in orbit or a suit of Aegis armor. ‚ÄúThis is fake and gay, just like me. Fuck, now I‚Äôm actually angry!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat is good to hear, Private, but perhaps those thoughts are best kept‚Ä¶ private?‚Äù Natori observed, propping his head up with three fingers as he leaned against the arm of his command chair and looked an apology at Qul‚ÄôRoth and a handful of watchstanders. \n\n‚ÄúSays the Admiral who could have killed the comms at any time from his end? You were just waiting to make that pun, sir,‚Äù Rex asserted, not seeming to care much if others heard. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on with the Lt?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLieutenant Winters is being sent to investigate another location where our missing hunter might be found. I am more than confident each of you will be able to handle whatever situations arise on your own.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd when do we lose the eye in the sky?‚Äù Rex demanded.\n\n‚ÄúForty minutes,‚Äù Natori informed him, causing the Private to click his tongue against the roof of his mouth. \n\n‚ÄúNot like I can run that long anyway.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSir, the pack has stopped! It‚Äôs difficult to discern more on account of all the wet ground and foliage but motion has definitely ceased,‚Äù Ensign Lee reported. Natori nodded and passed the information on to Rex as the crew member turned his chair back to face his monitors.\n\n‚ÄúYou appear to have a fixed target now, Private. Make haste if you please.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh no, cause I was just taking a stroll up until now!‚Äù Rex heaved, pushing himself harder as he accepted the forest‚Äôs challenge if for no other reason than to have something to fight.\n\n‚ÄúNow now, Rex,‚Äù Natori scolded him with a light tone, ensuring their conversation remained just between the two of them for the moment. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the sort of attitude that lost you a position in Delta.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNever liked them much anyway, sir,‚Äù Rex insisted bitterly, reminded of his manners. ‚ÄúThanks for putting up with me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDo your best to find this Cauthan, Private Rex. We have an unprecedented opportunity to ingratiate ourselves with the one powerful individual among their people who is most distrusting of us,‚Äù Natori explained wisely.\n\n‚ÄúWith all due respect, Admiral, who gives a shit?‚Äù Rex demanded, punching a tree trunk as he barreled past just for good measure, chipping the bark and sending a few stray pieces to the forest floor. Instead of tearing into Rex or reprimanding him, Natori steepled his fingers in thought for a long moment, looking over at Qul‚ÄôRoth as he recalled one of the tenants of the Ghaelen Order that he found rather compatible with much of human morality.\n\n‚ÄúBecause, Private Rex, the true measure of a man, and of a people, is determined not when they are helpless, but when they are powerful. When we return to Earth, our treatment of this small, insignificant village will be immeasurably important. I believe that quite strongly.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAlright, alright,‚Äù the soldier gasped between breaths as he pushed himself harder. ‚ÄúBut I feel the need to point out you would have never lasted a day in Delta either, sir.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh no, Private. On that point I believe we are in agreement,‚Äù Natori affirmed without any sort of clarification or qualification. The Admiral tapped his foot against the metal deck of the bridge, watching and waiting. He asked a question of the tiny dots that represented individual hyrven and their estimated position somewhere out in the Maran wilds.‚ÄúNow what is it that you‚Äôre waiting for?‚Äù\n\n\\----\n\nIn what some might have called a cruel twist of fate, and others a mild inconvenience, Natori and the rest of the Event Horizon passed beyond operational orbit shortly before Rex was able to make it to his destination. While the network of satellites in orbit allowed for some amount of continued data flow and communication, it fell to Rex to be the eyes on the ground.\n\n‚ÄúHah, goddamn that smarts,‚Äù he complained, clutching at his side. ‚ÄúLooks like a bit of a Mexican standoff, sir.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCan you be more specific, Private?‚Äù Natori requested. ‚ÄúI doubt you mean to imply the local fauna have learned how to operate firearms?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWaste of time,‚Äù Rex declared instead, activating the video feed between his helmet and the bridge to spare himself from giving the Admiral a play by play. He was standing about twenty yards from the nearest hyrven, who had by that time more than registered his presence and were snarling and yipping at him. ‚ÄúAre you going to get mad at me if I shoot them, sir?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, Private Rex.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJust a little bit?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, Private Rex,‚Äù Natori repeated, unable to keep a smirk from his lips thanks to relief if nothing else. ‚ÄúDo you have a visual on our missing hunter?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, but I know where he is,‚Äù Rex confirmed, slumping his shoulders and walking forward with tired steps. Another hyrven got in on the action, backing up its packmate and presenting a united front against the being that seemed to not care one iota that they were busy with a hunt. Rex scolded them as he approached utterly without fear. ‚ÄúGet out of my way if you know what‚Äôs good for you, damn dogs.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThey are a bit more cat-like, wouldn‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù Natori opined, watching with utter fascination as two of his watchstanders whispered about how the day‚Äôs mission was ‚Äòbetter than the old Attenborough films‚Äô. \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my job, Admiral!‚Äù Rex retorted, drawing his pistol. Natori was about to shout a reprimand, but it proved unnecessary as Rex fired directly above once. The crack of the gunshot echoed through the trees and caused several of the hyrven to literally jump into the air in shock. Many took off running, while a few of the brave ones retreated in confusion, barking and whining to one another as Rex strode forward to where a large, decaying tree trunk rested against a rocky protrusion in the middle of the forest. Against that moss-covered barrier rested a Cauthan who had seen better days. His fur and hunting leathers were caked in mud, clearly intentionally, and his eyes were wide and wild from adrenaline and lack of sleep. Before him on the ground rested the reason the hyrven pack had not simply devoured him, one of their own stabbed through the throat. Rex nodded with approval as he surveyed the scene silently, even more so when the Cauthan turned the spear on him.\n\n‚ÄúBegone, apparition! I will not go to Kel this day, not now!‚Äù he insisted, his throat dry from lack of water and his words scratchy and worn. The Beta Jumper laughed loudly and reached for his canteen, tossing it to the damp soil at the Cauthan‚Äôs bare feet. He noticed one of the hunter‚Äôs talons was chipped, perhaps a casualty of whatever struggle had brought him to his current predicament.\n\n‚ÄúI like you, man!‚Äù Rex laughed, making the connection between the Cauthan death god and the Aegis armor. It was common knowledge among the Event Horizon‚Äôs crew by that point that Winters was considered something of a deity among the locals. ‚ÄúBut if you could never compare me to that stuck up Lt again I‚Äôd appreciate it. Drink, it‚Äôs just water. Then we‚Äôre going to get you out of here, Admiral‚Äôs orders. Damn language barrier. Whatever.‚Äù\n\nThe desire to get out of his helmet for a moment and wipe the sweat from his brow overrode the need to understand whatever the hunter was muttering about, so Rex indulged himself. The sight of a human face actually seemed to set the hunter at ease, and he watched as the Cauthan took his spear in one hand before reaching for the canteen. As with anything in the wilds, the huntsman examined the container carefully, turning it over in his palm and testing the metallic surface with his claws. Apparently satisfied that the vessel itself was not a threat, he took a knee so as to remain ready to respond to surrounding threats, spear cradled against his shoulder as he used both hands to unscrew the cap and tentatively sniff at the contents.\n\n‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he said as he realized it was water and nothing deceptive. Rex didn‚Äôt understand the words, but it was easy enough to nod in acknowledgment. After several sips, each of which he swished around in his mouth to soothe his parched palate, the hunter offered him his canteen back. \n\n‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù Rex demanded, returning his effects and his helmet to their rightful place. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôve got family worried about you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMight I know your name first, savior?‚Äù the huntsman requested, using his spear to hobble over to the dead hyrven which he promptly began gutting and skinning.\n\n‚ÄúRex is fine; definitely never call me savior,‚Äù the human insisted before opening up a line to the Event Horizon. ‚ÄúI got him, Admiral. His leg‚Äôs gimped, but we should be able to get back. Hey you, do you really need to be doing that? Rest of them are still out there.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMy wife and daughters would likely insist otherwise, but coming home injured and empty handed would be worse than not coming home at all. You seem capable,‚Äù the Cauthan replied, not ceasing his quick and dirty work. The difference between him and Russell Winters was quite apparent. Rex scoffed.\n\n‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt expect me to tell that to your daughters. Do what you will; it‚Äôs not like I have anything better to do,‚Äù the Jumper insisted, silently thankful for an extended period to catch his breath. The lactic acid that had built up in his legs was a mild annoyance. ‚ÄúSo what happened to you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI finally made a mistake, Rex. I was preparing to die. You are a welcome sight.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThanks to you I might make it to my fortieth year. You‚Äôre sure Valta didn‚Äôt send you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know who that is,‚Äù Rex said.\n\n‚ÄúThe goddess of the hunt, and the lady I serve.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSure that‚Äôs not your wife?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou are a human full of questions. I just assumed you were a god given your bulk.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHa! Glad to hear it. But no, I‚Äôm mortal and a hell of a lot younger than you are, made more mistakes too from the sound of it. And if the mud on your fur is any indication you were getting ready to survive instead of die, so spare me and let‚Äôs get you home to your family.‚Äù\n\nThe hunter paused his work for the first time, adjusting his weight so as to lighten the burden on his twisted ankle. ‚ÄúYou are a strange one, human, but you have a point. That doesn‚Äôt mean I would have survived.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell today‚Äôs your lucky day then, I guess. You catch a root on your leg or something?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rather shameful but that‚Äôs exactly what happened. The rains have been plentiful of late and the grounds are not as sturdy as they should be. I avoided the ravine but, well, you have seen the rest.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah, do you really need to be doing that though?‚Äù Rex gestured towards the carcass, noticing that a few of the hyrven were still watching them intently from the cover of trees and underbrush.\n\n‚ÄúI do, my daughter is of age this year. Meylith willing, she will find a mate and her mother and I will be left to fend for ourselves.‚Äù\n\nRex listened to the sounds of the forest, contemplating a world to which he had almost no frame of reference. Natori eventually interrupted to inform him that Winters was enroute to his location. ‚ÄúSo what, when you all get married you don‚Äôt visit home anymore?‚Äù he asked.\n\n‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt we?‚Äù the hunter asked, more talkative now that the water was working its way through his body and the idea of conservation seemed less important thanks to the armored human watching over him. ‚ÄúShe will still have her own duties when she is mated.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI get it,‚Äù Rex said without getting it at all. ‚ÄúWell just hurry up, would you? Don‚Äôt want to keep them waiting.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, not at all,‚Äù the hunter agreed. ‚ÄúI am almost finished but I find myself in the unenviable position of asking you to-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll carry it, it‚Äôs fine. Just don‚Äôt make me run,‚Äù Rex snapped, not sure why he was suddenly feeling agitated. He blamed the knowledge that Winters was on his way.\n\n‚ÄúRun? I doubt I‚Äôll be able to run for a cycle or two!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre in good spirits suddenly.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not being eaten alive, Rex. Of course I‚Äôm in good spirits. I may even see my dear Rena again, assuming she‚Äôs not too busy working leather.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs stay focused on the here and now, old man,‚Äù Rex suggested, keeping his vigil with rifle in hand. ‚ÄúNot getting eaten alive is a good start.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, no need to convince me,‚Äù the hunter sighed, pulling himself around to the other side of the hyrven to continue his field dressing. He winced in pain occasionally, but worked through it. Neither spoke again until the job was complete. ‚ÄúI am ready, Rex.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAlright, how do you want to do this? Can you walk with your spear or do you need me?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI should be alright with my spear if we move slowly, but they will not just let us leave,‚Äù the hunter worried, noticing that the hyrven still had not departed.\n\n‚ÄúOh they will, just stay close to me,‚Äù Rex instructed with eager tension in his voice. The Jumper shouldered the well dressed kill with one hand, the hunter‚Äôs skill at his task preventing much blood or gore from getting on his armor. In the other hand he brandished his hammer, motioning for the hunter to walk just ahead of him. ‚ÄúTime to look them in the eyes and tell them you‚Äôre going home.‚Äù\n\nThe hyrven did not seem pleased about the situation, growling and snarling at the two of them as Rex used his HUD to point the way home. The hunter didn‚Äôt require much direction, however, innately pointing himself in the right direction as well. Each step of his left leg was assisted heavily by his spear, and they slowly made their way towards part of the circle of wild beasts that were none too happy at being denied a meal. When one of them barked loudly at the two elopers, Rex yelled right back. Another approached from a different angle, only to yelp and jump back as Rex‚Äôs hammer swung in a wide arc before burying itself into the ground right where the hyrven‚Äôs head had been a moment before.\n\n‚ÄúLook, either die or fuck off!‚Äù Rex exploded in frustration, though his companion found the situation quite humorous, no doubt a mixture of nerves and relief. The hyrven continued to posture and raise a ruckus, but Rex didn‚Äôt allow them an opening. It was only a matter of time before the less standoffish among the pack decided to approach and eat the guts and other refuse the hunter had left behind. After a tense few minutes the human and Cauthan had been allowed to pass, the sounds of the pack fading into the distance.\n\n‚ÄúThank you, Rex, for my life.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou got a name or something?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBrythis.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell I didn‚Äôt do it for you, Brythis. But you‚Äôre welcome. We should get you home to your family.‚Äù\n\n\\-----\n\n‚ÄúWinters!‚Äù the rescued hunter called as the Omega Jumper came into view through the trees. Following Rex‚Äôs location of the missing Cauthan, he and Io had made a beeline for them, meeting up close to sundown. Though Brythis obviously recognized him, Russell had a bit of difficulty discerning just who was under all of the mud and grime. ‚ÄúI was just discussing the finer points of tracking chesko via their droppings with this strapping lad here.‚Äù\n\nIo and her partner could not help but share a moment of amusement at Rex‚Äôs predicament. While they were not on close terms with every Cauthan in the village, even the hunters and craftsmen, they knew Brythis well enough. The hunter‚Äôs younger daughter was around Zolta‚Äôs age and worked alongside him at the temple of Tyrdus. Despite the public, friendly rivalry that existed among many in those respective guilds, apprenticeships between the two were equally common. The Cauthan himself was something of Ratha‚Äôs opposite, possessing a rather upbeat and sunny disposition after so many years of survival. Rex seemed to be at his wit‚Äôs end. ‚ÄúCan you take over?‚Äù he requested in exasperation.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Private Rex? Not interested in chesko droppings?‚Äù Winters wondered, allowing the missing ‚Äòsir‚Äô to lay by the wayside. ‚ÄúBrythis, have you been chatting him up this whole time?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOf course! I was about to die,‚Äù the Cauthan related in a voice still gravelly and worn from his ordeal. ‚ÄúAnd between the two of you I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be having any problem with the beasts that are out and about.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJust drink up,‚Äù Winters insisted, tossing the hunter his own water supply before following it up with spare rations and a helping hand. Fenrir was not pleased to see the chesko jerky being handed over to someone that wasn‚Äôt him. Russell roughed up the fur between his ears. ‚ÄúAnd you stop being needy. We feed you all the time.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo you got a dog, a wife, and kids on the way? Where‚Äôs the white picket fence, sir? Didn‚Äôt see that one in the job description,‚Äù Rex joked.\n\n‚ÄúThought you were tapping out, Private. Why don‚Äôt you give the locals a try, settle down yourself? Maybe you‚Äôll marry into enough real estate for a fence if the walls aren‚Äôt enough for you,‚Äù Winters countered easily before turning to the hunter who was still hobbling along at his own merry pace. ‚ÄúYou doing alright?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh yes, quite splendid now that I won‚Äôt be meeting Kel today. The ankle will heal with time, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFancy a bit of human medical care?‚Äù Winters offered. Io pursed her lips thoughtfully, though if anyone was going to tell him he couldn‚Äôt appropriate Event Horizon personnel and equipment, it wasn‚Äôt her. ‚ÄúWhat do you think, Io?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòWith the patient‚Äôs permission I don‚Äôt see why not. Just don‚Äôt leave Thantis out. He‚Äôd never forgive you.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúYes, I think I‚Äôll take the priest‚Äôs opinion first,‚Äù the hunter mused. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not opposed. Just seems a bit much over a slip of the foot.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA slip that almost got you killed, apparently,‚Äù Winters reminded him. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just get back. We can worry about that later.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, I suppose Ratha is likely feeling a bit down at this point,‚Äù Brythis acknowledged. ‚ÄúShe already has so much on her mind and now she‚Äôs with cub.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt think of another female or two who might be a bit more upset?‚Äù Russell asked sarcastically.\n\n‚ÄúOf course! But I already imagined their grief during the long night and I wish to reflect upon that no further.‚Äù\n\nRussell frowned under his helmet, privately agreeing that if the Ursae had left him broken and dying, he would not have wanted to imagine Veera‚Äôs face at his funeral. ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs not give anyone anymore reason to cry.‚Äù\n\n\\-----\n\n‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôre here to tell me that grizzled idiot stumbled out of the woods just now, leave me be,‚Äù Ratha requested dourly. Antoth stood at the threshold of her private room, unmoving.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, Ratha. But the human Lachlan just spoke to me. They found him‚Ä¶ alive.‚Äù The former Guardian held his ground as Ratha glared daggers at him, face drawn with a plethora of negative emotions and a bit of relief. At least he imagined relief was there as well. ‚ÄúI did not order it. He heard a rumor and acted of his own accord.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs how it is then?‚Äù the pregnant Huntress wondered, looking down at her table where she‚Äôd been spinning her knife, point down, for hours. A mug of cold tea, half finished, sat nearby.\n\n‚ÄúI thought you would be pleased.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd what will happen when the humans clothe us of their own accord, Antoth? Will they be doing that next after they begin to feed us? How long before our people are like that hyrven that nips at Veera‚Äôs heels? Can you call something like that a hyrven at all?‚Äù Ratha wondered, never bothering to look directly at him. Antoth exhaled patiently, walking past her and adding a small log to their fire. Ratha still refused to use human lanterns.\n\n‚ÄúWould you prefer another Sentaura?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOf course not! But I am taking care of her. *We* are taking care of her, as we always have. And we will do the same for his family if he doesn‚Äôt return. There is no place for someone like me in this new, human world.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTell that to our cub if you insist on saying such things around me,‚Äù Antoth growled, taking a knee at her side. She glanced at him before returning to her cup.\n\n‚ÄúI will not grow angry with you for doing what you think is right for our people. That is your right as Priest of Seil. It does not mean I don‚Äôt worry for my own way of life. I wonder what will be left for us when food is plentiful, when cloaks craft themselves, and everything else that damn human seems to have at the tip of his clawless fingers,‚Äù Ratha complained. Antoth took her hand from her knee into his own, and she allowed it.\n\n‚ÄúThe humans will not be here forever. There will come a time we will be alone and forced to rely only on ourselves again. I am just doing everything I can to prepare us for that day. Having one more hunter only helps,‚Äù he reasoned.\n\n‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôve gone from one to three to however many of those furless nightmares feel like showing up on any given day. Need I remind you that the ones we have met are primarily trained for war?!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou mean the ones that have found the most common ground with our own people? Ratha‚Ä¶‚Äù Antoth shook his head and steeled himself, standing before her. ‚ÄúVeera is pregnant.‚Äù\n\nA poignant silence fell between the two of them, punctuated only by the far off noise that heralded Rex and Russell‚Äôs arrival back at the western gate, just after darkness had fallen over the village. The auburn huntress collected her thoughts, scowling at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not dumb enough to joke about that sort of thing, Antoth. Have you found the one who did it yet?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWinters did it, Ratha. I have requested every high priest convene tonight after we take our meals.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCall it off. You cannot honestly believe that, can you?‚Äù Ratha demanded of her husband. He replied just as sternly.\n\n‚ÄúYou honestly believe any male would risk the wrath of the ursae slayer?‚Äù When Ratha did not have a reply or witty comeback, Antoth continued. ‚ÄúSpirit Io believes Veera will give birth to her own cubs. I do not claim to understand the workings of Meylith, but that is what was reported to me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBy who?‚Äù his wife demanded as the fire crackled lightly.\n\n‚ÄúThantis and Gentia both felt I should know.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen why is it necessary for us to meet about this? Nerazek, Staroth, and Alyra surely don‚Äôt have an interest in Veera‚Äôs private affairs, eternally strange as they are. Why do you have that look on your face, scarface? You know I hate that damn look.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI will need to speak at length with spirit Io, the human‚Äôs leader, and their healers, but if what I hear from them is favorable‚Ä¶ it would be my intention to share this knowledge at the conclusion of the harvest festival. You and I both know that there will be unpaired females this year, Ratha.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt dare,‚Äù Ratha whispered, standing and trespassing as close into his personal space as possibly without bumping him with her belly. ‚ÄúThe mutt is one thing, but you would whore our females to the humans?! Have you taken leave of every one of your senses? If you propose this I will motion that you be unseated! I may be your mate but I am also a Cauthan!‚Äù\n\nAntoth‚Äôs face fell, but he matched Ratha‚Äôs gaze, allowing her threat to hang over them for some time as he collected his thoughts. He found it impossible to fault her or her anger. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat- that‚Äôs it? That‚Äôs all you have to say to me after what you just suggested? I see!?‚Äù She raised her voice at him, clawing the ground with a talon.\n\n‚ÄúYou said it yourself, Ratha. I am bound by duty to consider all of our people. If you believe I have lost my mind‚Ä¶ you may suggest to the priests that I be removed,‚Äù he allowed sadly.\n\n‚ÄúThink about what you‚Äôre saying-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI have thought about it!‚Äù Antoth finally lost his patience. ‚ÄúWhen have you ever known me to be rash and impatient, Ratha? Our people are barely hanging on. You expect me to do nothing when there is hope, no matter how small or ridiculous, that our young females might all be mated and fruitful? Or do you perhaps think I intend to force them to take human mates against their will?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOur people will survive as we always have! And I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore, scarface. This isn‚Äôt the world we were born into. Things are never going back,‚Äù Ratha lamented, grimacing as she contemplated admitting to any sort of weakness. ‚ÄúI fear for our cub, and I fear for my hunters. I want to go back to the way things were.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEven if we would all be dead?‚Äù Antoth whispered. Ratha shook her head and grabbed him by the arms.\n\n‚ÄúAt least I knew where I belonged in that world, even if it wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù\n\nAntoth relented and held her closely. ‚ÄúIf you truly believe it is for the best, I will say nothing. But the secret will not be kept, Ratha. Veera will grow just as big as you are now, and the questions will come all the same.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe gods must truly enjoy watching me suffer,‚Äù she laughed bitterly as the raucous noises of Brythis‚Äô impromptu welcome home celebration made their way back to her temple. Ratha pressed her fingers against the top of her muzzle as though trying to ward off a headache. ‚ÄúThe lost don‚Äôt come back. But I guess now they do and I need to go out there and act happy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWho says you need to be happy about it?‚Äù Antoth wondered, cocking an almost sly grin at her. It would have been sly were he capable of such things, but she seemed to understand his meaning. Ratha collected her knife from the table and returned it to her side before poking him in the behind, making it clear that they were both leaving. \n\n‚ÄúI will think about what you intend before the council. We will see what they say. And if things go the way I suspect they will, you will arrange a meeting with the human chieftain where we will impress upon him exactly what they can and cannot take from us.‚Äù Ratha‚Äôs tone left no room for argument, but Antoth found himself in agreement. \n\n‚ÄúIt will be done, Ratha. Now maybe don‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre going to kill him just to finish what the forest started?‚Äù he proposed with a low chuckle, pleasing to her ears.\n\n‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the fun in that?‚Äù Ratha demanded, waltzing out into the main area of her temple where she found Brythis surrounded by his compatriots, his family, and one of the other humans. This one seemed to have the good sense to keep his mouth shut, watching over proceedings from the doorway. His body language made it clear he didn‚Äôt particularly want to be there, but she didn‚Äôt pay him much heed. ‚ÄúYou.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHuntress, you are a sight for sore eyes,‚Äù her fellow greeted her, looking rather worse for wear. He was still caked with mud and looked ready to pass out from exhaustion, but he‚Äôd brought back a hyrven, which she noted approvingly. She enjoyed how quickly the celebration snuffed itself out under her gaze, even despite her pregnancy.\n\n‚ÄúGood kill, Brythis. Be more careful next time.‚Äù\n\n\\-----\n\n‚ÄúWelcome, everyone. Gentia, thank you for the use of your temple this evening,‚Äù Antoth offered as he, Ratha, and the other high priests congregated later that evening. Thantis, of course, had brought tea which they sipped appreciatively. Ratha had shown annoyance at having been offered a special brew for the health of expecting mothers, but consumed it nevertheless with muttered thanks.\n\n‚ÄúAre you ever going to get yourself a temple, Antoth?‚Äù Nerazek asked jovially. \n\n‚ÄúAre you and your craftsmen finished rebuilding everything we lost?‚Äù Antoth countered politely. When the high priest of Tyrdus replied in the negative, he nodded softly. ‚ÄúI am more than fine with an ursae skull. The needs of our people are greater than mine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always a bed for you in the barracks if Ratha kicks you out!‚Äù Staroth added, earning a small laugh from Gentia and Alyra. ‚ÄúSo what news, Antoth? Last time you asked us all together it was about the treaty with the humans. Has something happened?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSomething has happened, Staroth, but it does not concern the other humans for now,‚Äù Antoth explained cryptically, causing Alyra to lean forward and adjust her tortoiseshell glasses. Since receiving them from Alice she‚Äôd not been seen without them by anyone in the village.\n\n‚ÄúOther humans? I thought maybe that thick one got up to some trouble. What has Winters gotten himself mixed up in now?‚Äù the Guardian asked, something like anticipation in his voice. If nothing else, Veera‚Äôs mate was always good for a story or two. \n\n‚ÄúWhat indeed,‚Äù the high priest mused, glancing at Ratha. She rolled her eyes and motioned for him to get on with it. ‚ÄúGentia and Thantis are already aware of this, but Veera is pregnant. And before you all ask about how I intend to punish the offender‚Ä¶ the human healers and spirit Io all have reason to believe that Winters is the father.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOr that there is no father,‚Äù Thantis supplied, rounding out the potential explanations. \n\n‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs twins, by the way,‚Äù Gentia added as though she were making mention of the weather. ‚ÄúCount on the males to leave out the fun part.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious, Gentia?‚Äù Alyra gasped.\n\n‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm quite serious!‚Äù the priestess of Meylith replied, laughing happily. ‚ÄúI performed the examination myself the day Thantis returned from his little expedition to Kel‚Äôs domain with the human vessel. Veera is most certainly pregnant.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd no one has come forward?‚Äù Staroth demanded seriously of Antoth.\n\n‚ÄúNo, Staroth. As I said, I don‚Äôt believe anyone will. I know it‚Äôs difficult to believe, but I find it equally difficult to believe any male in the village would take that risk with so many available females, even if we don‚Äôt take into consideration the bond Veera and Winters share with one another.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúFair enough, but that female‚Äôs put on a lot of meat over the year,‚Äù Staroth pointed out appreciatively, causing collective groans from just about everyone assembled except Alyra.\n\n‚ÄúI simply must ask her how she does it,‚Äù the priestess of the Twins declared before Antoth slammed his fist into his palm to signal for order.\n\n‚ÄúEnough! If you want to train to be a soldier, Alyra, you serve the wrong gods. And Staroth, no, nevermind. You won‚Äôt listen to me anyway. At least you know better than anyone else what Winters can do to anyone who touches his mate the wrong way. On the subject of Veera‚Äôs cubs I am‚Ä¶ cautiously choosing to believe that Meylith has blessed them, in agreement with the humans and spirit Io. That is why I have gathered you all here tonight. Veera‚Äôs pregnancy will not remain a secret for much longer, either because they will speak of it themselves or because nature will take its course. You all understand what will happen then. There will be talk. Questions will be asked of us. We will need to provide guidance, as is our duty.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHere it comes,‚Äù Ratha sighed, earning a glare from Antoth. ‚ÄúI enjoy you when you‚Äôre all angry like that. Just go on. What the leftovers do is none of my concern.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou are always such a ray of sunshine, my dear,‚Äù Gentia simpered, earning a glare from Ratha and complicated glance from Antoth that was stuck somewhere between thanks and annoyance at her poking the hornet‚Äôs nest. ‚ÄúSo what is your proposal then, sun priest?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEvery darn time,‚Äù the black-furred Cauthan huffed before clearing his throat, straightening his shoulders, and addressing his peers formally. ‚ÄúI propose to you all that we inform the village at large on the last evening of the harvest festival, once the year‚Äôs pairings have occurred. Furthermore, I propose that we encourage unmated females to pair with human males in the event they find themselves without a partner and do not believe they will be able to find one during their youth.‚Äù\n\nThe expressions on Thantis and Gentia‚Äôs faces made it clear that Antoth‚Äôs proposal was bold, even for them. Alyra was looking over the rim of her glasses at him as though he‚Äôd grown another head. Nerazek and Staroth remained stoic, with frowns furrowing their brows. Ratha, however, was smiling. ‚ÄúTold you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThank you for your support, Huntress,‚Äù Antoth growled. ‚ÄúI assume the rest of you object as well?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúReject outright may be a bit much, but what guarantee is there that any of the females in the village will experience the same result?‚Äù Alyra asked.\n\n‚ÄúThere is no guarantee,‚Äù their leader admitted, shaking his head. ‚ÄúEven the humans are confused at this development. But perhaps I am overreacting?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe situation is difficult no matter how one looks at it,‚Äù Thantis acknowledged. ‚ÄúWe have weathered losses like this before but recovery will take a generation or more.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd there will be plenty of pregnant or widowed mothers tending to the fields,‚Äù Gentia added before looking at the situation more shrewdly. ‚ÄúI believe Antoth‚Äôs course of action should be approved. A piece of vellum or parchment is one thing, mating bonds and children are quite another. The more human men who find themselves tied to our own females, the better.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one word for it. Sounds like a disaster to me,‚Äù Ratha snapped. ‚ÄúYou expect them all to behave like Winters? What‚Äôs stopping them from getting on that ship of theirs and just leaving once they‚Äôve had their fun soiling our maidens?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Gentia admitted. ‚ÄúBut there is even less that would prevent them from doing so currently, and if you would swallow your pride for a moment, Ratha, you would realize that the humans remaining here is our best hope of surviving what‚Äôs befallen this village.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAt least I still have my pride!‚Äù the Huntress snapped right back. ‚ÄúUnlike you who seem ready to discard everything we are for scraps from their table!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSilence!‚Äù Antoth commanded, slamming his fist on the wooden bench he was seated upon. ‚ÄúEvery time, I swear upon Seil. You forget yourself, Ratha. Do not think you are the sole defender of our people and our ways.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt sure feels that way more and more,‚Äù his mate countered, refusing to be cowed into silence. Gentia was more than capable of defending herself without Antoth‚Äôs aid, however.\n\n‚ÄúHow many of your hunters are you willing to sacrifice upon the altar of the old ways, if that is what you choose to call them? How many scrolls have yellowed and faded over time or been lost? How many stories have been forgotten because those who knew them died before they could pass them on? The humans preserve even the most inconsequential of words with the press of a finger. If we could gain access to their technology our way of life would be preserved forever, or at least far beyond anything that we or our own cubs would be capable of. The bonds of Meylith are some of the oldest known tools of union and negotiation. If there are others like Veera and the humans give us more cubs as well, then so be it.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this talk one bit,‚Äù Nerazek declared. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt like the idea of our young ones wasting away without family, love, or cubs. Human technology is one thing, Gentia, but we should not force the matter.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI never said we should,‚Äù the elder clarified. ‚ÄúI simply propose that if upon learning of Veera‚Äôs blessing a young female chooses to follow in her footsteps, she should be welcomed and supported so long as no males her age are suitable. It was rather easy to allow it of Veera, was it not? This will not be the same.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, it will not,‚Äù Antoth agreed. ‚ÄúI must admit I did not even consider using such partnerships as leverage to secure us a more favorable position vis a vis the humans. It is‚Ä¶ compelling, especially when one considers the weapons and armor at their disposal.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI remain opposed,‚Äù Ratha insisted in no uncertain terms. ‚ÄúBut if the remainder of the council is in favor I will simply take bitter pleasure in the event I get to say ‚ÄòI told you so‚Äô.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI need some time to think on this,‚Äù Alyra spoke up, prompting Nerazek, Staroth, and Thantis to agree more or less immediately. Antoth was not displeased with the outcome. \n\n‚ÄúGentia, how far along is Veera?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLess than a season, Antoth. I would say four cycles at most. It is approximately another four to the harvest festival. Those who are not looking will be unlikely to notice but there will not be much time afterward before she is unable to hide it even with loose clothing, assuming she even chooses to. Knowing her she will do just the opposite.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor once we are in agreement, Gentia,‚Äù Ratha snarked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre getting out of this, scarface.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat was not my intention,‚Äù he replied quietly before addressing the full congregation. ‚ÄúWhen the moons are next full, will that be enough time for you to make your deliberations?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI have no objections,‚Äù Staroth affirmed. The others soon followed. Antoth crossed his arms over his chest and nodded, glancing over at the doorway to the granary. He contented himself with the knowledge that the harvest, at least, was shaping up to be a fruitful one.\n\n‚ÄúVery well. We shall reconvene then. Until that time your discretion in this matter is appreciated. Go with the gods everyone, and may they guide us all. Selah.‚Äù\n\n\\-----\n\n[Previous](https://redd.it/jsipdk) | [First](https://www.reddit.com/eo9svn) | [Next](https://redd.it/k4sy8m) | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SabatonBabylon)\n\n\\-----\n\nOwn The HEL Jumper: Survive in the format of your choice: [Hardcover, Softcover, and epub from Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/search/?adult_audience_rating=00&contributor=SabatonBabylon) | [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M5HJ4YP?pf_rd_p=c2945051-950f-485c-b4df-15aac5223b1)",

Leave with the rest. Abandoning the cubs. This would drastically hinder Human/Cauthan relations and trust at the least. Start a war at the most.\n2. Take their wives and children with them. This leaves the village with fewer Cauthan and likely results in the same outcome of #1. Not to mention leaving the Admiral in a really bad position of having to explain why there's pregnant/married aliens with children on his ship to his superiors.\n3. Dereliction of Duty. Stay on Mara and raise their children, leaving the Admiral to explain why his crew roster is lighter.\n\n\\#3 is the best-case scenario for everyone, but it's FAR from ideal. If it were up to me, I'd have to put my foot down with a ***HARD*** \"NO!\" \n\nWhat happens when the Humans that are there leave? Will they return one day? Could they? What happens when the humans who stayed behind die? Who would repair their tech? Are the Cauthan at an advanced enough stage that they can comprehend Human engineering?

The humans say that Sel killed thier first ship and he thinks that Kel delivered Winters to their village... But why? What it a reward? A challenge? A punishment? Did they want them to change? Life is dynamic and chaotic. Only death is static. \"Did we become so set in our ways that we forgot how to grow?\" He wouldn't understand incompatible dna, all he would see is that Kel gave them a guardian just in time to protect the village and now the life and family goddess has given them a gift of twins right when they need more children.

    "body": "\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about transgender athletes on this subreddit over the last week or so, and it seems like the general consensus is something along the lines that the science is clear, and it shows that trans women always have an advantage over cis women, and should not compete with cis women but should instead be relegated to only comparing themselves to other trans women (or even to cis men). \"It's a settled issue\". I aim to challenge this perspective in this post.\n\nThe Nuance\n---------------------------------\n\nThe discussion on /r/xxfitness last week ago centered around the case of Laurel Hubbard. Laurel Hubbard is a 43 year old trans woman who transitioned in her mid 30s. She has competed professionally in women's weightlifting since 2017. She participated (and lost to a cis woman) in the women's world championship in 2019, and qualified for the New Zealand Olympic team in 2021.\n\nThe nuanced but still critical questions to ask here would be things like \"what is the appropriate hormonal limit for trans women to participate in women's sports, and should the existing guidelines be adjusted?\" and perhaps \"how long does it take for muscle and fat redistribution to stabilize after starting HRT?\", or perhaps even the spicier \"should we apply different standards to trans women depending on their age of transition?\"\n\nNone of these critical but at least somewhat reasonable questions dominated the discourse in the post discussing Laurel Hubbard. Instead the discourse centered around comments such as:\n\n> It doesn't really matter how little testosterone a male to female trans person has; she still had her entire adolescence to develop male-level muscle and bone density, which explains the records she is setting in the female league. The non-trans women don't stand a chance against her, despite how hard they train.\n\nThis claim is not backed by science. She has lost the world championship to cis women twice, and is not expected to win any medals at the Olympics, so the idea that cis women stand no chance is ignorant or just an outright lie (and of course, if she does win that would not prove this statement either because the statement is not provable, especially not through one case study).\n\n> Limb length and associated levers are also a sporting advantage that male to female trans people have that is not done away with by medical transition, although I'm unsure of the degree of impact of this in weightlifting.\n\nLong limbs is a disadvantage in weightlifting, but the comment fits the \"critical\" narrative that dominated the thread discussing Laurel Hubbard, so it got plenty of points. Should we also ban cis women with long limbs? Obviously not. What about swimmers with double-jointed elbows or reduced lactic acid production? Why is being trans where the line is drawn on how much of a freak of nature professional athletes are allowed to be? Being trans is no more a choice than being born with double-jointed elbows, in case that was somehow in doubt. It's of course also not the case that all trans women have long limbs, so generalizing long limbs or some such \"advantage\" as a reason to discriminate against trans women is absurd - especially if the same logic is not applied to cis people.\n\n> The way I understand it, being trans is about gender identity, while sports is about biological sex. It should be possible for Laurel to compete in the biological male category, but be respected as a woman otherwise in life.\n\nI'm going to take this comment in good faith and assume that the commenter just has a thorough lack of understanding about what transition is like for trans women. No one is seriously arguing that someone who is assigned male at birth should simply be able to say \"I am a woman\" and then participate in women's sport (alright, some very small minority of the trans community might say this but it is not the opinion of the broader transgender community, and it is not my opinion). Trans women are, in many ways, *biologically* much closer to cis women than to cis men and claiming that trans women should compete with cis men is either ignorant or malicious.\n\nThese were all highly upvoted comments in the post about Laurel Hubbard from a few days ago. The discussion post the following day was not much better - the top voted comments do not challenge the premise that trans women have an unfair advantage and should not participate in women's sport, in fact they completely buy into it. From the top two comments:\n\n> Technically, no, you‚Äôll never be able to benchmark yourself compared to women who did not transition.\n\nand\n\n> The perhaps too-obvious solution is to find other MTF lifters to compete with and/or compare yourself to\n\nI could keep goingand going, but I'll stop quoting now. The point is that the sentiment among a significant portion of the sub seems to be that trans women should never compete with or compare themselves to cis women in any case.\n\nThe Science\n-------------------\n\nHRT aims to change the hormonal balance of trans woman from a testosterone dominant environment to an estrogen dominant environment. My experiences talking to cis people has taught me that most people have absolutely no idea what hormones are or do. The reality of the matter is that sex hormones (i.e. testosterone and estrogen) are what determines secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development, muscle strength/volume/distribution, fat distribution, skin texture and many other physical characteristics. Yes, all of these aspects are affected, even for trans women who transition post-puberty. Overall, it is simply not accurate to describe trans women who undergo HRT as biologically male. Biologically, trans women are in many ways much, much closer to cis women than to cis men, which is of course why they were allowed to participate in women's sport at all.\n\nIt is true that some traits are not affected by HRT in trans women after undergoing male puberty. This includes voice, bone structure (but not bone density), and genitals (although the function of the genitals can be affected) and obviously chromosomes. The first two traits mentioned here *are* affected in trans women who do not undergo male puberty.\n\n**[I recommend this article for a more in depth look at the topic of transgender women in sports, including a good dive into the science and the historical cases that has led to the current sporting guidelines. This article contains links to primary research source backing up everything I have said here.](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/shades-of-gray-sex-gender-and-fairness-in-sport/)**\n\nNow I want to return to recent posts on this subreddit, none of which really engaged with the science at all, and usually people were downvoted when asking for scientific backing of statements like the ones I quoted earlier. If you dig down far enough however, you will find comments linking this study: [Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01389-3), using it to support the notion that trans women always have an advantage and that trans women should simply never compete with or even compare themselves with cis women.\n\nThe study does not support this idea. From the study: \n\n> the loss of lean body mass, muscle area and strength typically amounts to approximately 5% after 12 months of treatment\n\nand then:\n\n> we report that current evidence shows the biological advantage, most notably in terms of muscle mass and strength, conferred by male puberty and thus enjoyed by most transgender women is only minimally reduced when testosterone is suppressed as per **current sporting guidelines** for transgender athletes.\n\nThe 12 month window is explored because the current sporting guidelines (for the Olympics, for example) require a testosterone level of no more than 10 nm/L for 12 months, which is applied equally to cis and trans women.\n\nThis limit of 10 nm/L is pretty high for women, and most trans and cis women alike are *well* below this limit. As an anecdote I can tell you that my testosterone level is below 1.0 nm/L, which is in the lower end of normal for cis women (I'm a trans woman) and I know several other trans women with similarly low values. Interestingly, this limit of 10nm/L is the same one that caused problems for cisgender athlete Caster Semenya a short while ago, but for brevity's sake I will not get into that case here.\n\nIt is also worth keeping in mind that changes in muscle and fat composition take much longer than 12 months to stabilize, so claiming that someone who has been on HRT for, say, 10 years has only experienced a 5% drop in athletic performance based on this study is either ignorant or outright malicious. The real conclusion one might be able to draw from this study is: one year on HRT might not be long enough to ensure fairness when trans women participate in women's competitions where strength is an important factor. That's literally it. The study does not address how long it should take, nor does it address questions like \"what, if any, advantage remains after 3, 5 or 10 years?\". It also does not address trans women who do not undergo male puberty.\n\nAnother study I've seen thrown around at times, which seems better at first glance, is this one: [How does hormone transition in transgender women change body composition, muscle strength and haemoglobin? Systematic review with a focus on the implications for sport participation](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2021/02/28/bjsports-2020-103106)\n\nThis study is a review of the available literature on the physiological changes caused by HRT (or GAHT, gender affirming hormone treatment as they call it in the article). The study concludes that\n\n> In transwomen, hormone therapy rapidly reduces Hgb to levels seen in cisgender women. In contrast, hormone therapy decreases strength, LBM and muscle area, yet values remain above that observed in cisgender women, even after 36 months. These findings suggest that strength may be well preserved in transwomen during the first 3 years of hormone therapy.\n\nIn other words, a the study suggests that a strength advantage remains. I wasn't convinced by this conclusion, however, so I dug into the article further and found that the 5 primary studies they use to conclude that a strength advantage remains are based on groups of trans women with average  testosterone concentrations of 19.0, 17.5, 15.2, 18.0, and 18.3 nm/L. Those values are *far* outside both the normal cis women levels (which also means outside the normal trans women levels), and outside the current sporting guidelines which requires no higher than 10.0. The authors even acknowledge this as a problem themselves when discussing the study design of the studies they chose to include:\n\n> The high post-GAHT testosterone is a possible confounder, and potential physiological differences between adolescent and adult participants may also confound results.\n\nI'm sorry but yeah, no shit that high testosterone levels are a confounding factor when studying strength. **I cannot believe the audacity of the authors writing in the conclusion that \"These findings suggest that strength may be well preserved in transwomen during the first 3 years of hormone therapy\" when the studies look at trans women who are not only well above the normal cis female hormone range, but not even within the current sporting guidelines (which is 10.0 nm/L). Incredible. The studies included only show that trans women who retain a high level of testosterone retain a strength advantage, which is not only not surprising at all, but also completely different from the claims made in the conclusion.**\n\nThere's of course much more to say about the science, [but the gist of it is that although it is complicated, the science leans much more towards including trans women in cis women's sports than not, as shown in this very thorough article that I linked earlier](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/shades-of-gray-sex-gender-and-fairness-in-sport/). And I'm sorry to be so blunt, but spreading misinformation claiming that trans women *always* have an advantage and should *never* be compared to or compete with cis women, simply based on an unscientific knee-jerk defensive feeling, is transphobic. I hope this post can serve as an opportunity for the community to reflect on these issues and hopefully show more empathy and nuance when engaging with these topics in the future.\n\nFinally, I apologize for the long post, but this topic is complicated and nuance requires many words sometimes. I hope some of you made it to the end.",

Imo it's a bit stupid to use trans women with such high levels of testosterone to make a point about trans women in general.",

        "body": "I know the case of Laurel Hubbard (the 43 year old trans woman weightlifter who made the New Zealand Olympic team) is of particular interest to some people on this subreddit, so I'll address that in more detail here.\n\nLaurel Hubbard might be an example of a trans athlete who enjoys an advantage in the specific sport of weightlifting due to having strength trained while having a high testosterone level for a couple of decades. The science is really not clear on how much of an advantage stays after HRT, but let's say she really does have an unfair advantage in strength competitions because some strength stays after transition after having strength trained with high testosterone for a couple of decades. In that case the rules should probably be different in weightlifting. Perhaps there should be a rule either banning or putting additional limits on *people who have strength trained with androgen levels over a certain limit for x number of years*. Notice how this phrasing avoids addressing transgender athletes directly. It would also affect cis women who engage in severe doping over x number of years because presumably they would gain a similar advantage. This is important because the advantage that Laurel might have in this case is emphatically not her status as a transgender person. It is her status as someone who strength trained in a high testosterone environment for many years in the past that might have given her an advantage.\n\nNow, let's say that Laurel Hubbard does in fact have an unfair advantage. Would that mean that all trans women have an advantage in all sports and should never compare themselves to or compete with cis women? Absolutely not, and this unfair and unnuanced generalization is what my post addresses, and that's why I didn't focus much on the case of Laurel Hubbard in the post itself. My issue was less with criticism of her specific case and more with the lack of nuance that a lot of people express when dealing with these topics more broadly.\n\nAs with strength retention the science on cardio performance is not clear, but unlike studies on strength retention the preliminary studies that have been done on long distance running in particular has shown that the advantage that trans women had pre-transition disappears very quickly post-transition. Imagine if it turns out (once the science is clearer) that yes, some strength advantage is retained (in some or all cases), but no cardio advantage is retained after transition for trans women. In this case it would of course be unfair to discriminate against trans women in running simply because Laurel Hubbard had an unfair advantage in weightlifting. The most fair approach seems to be to assess each sport individually.\n\nLike in my post, I recommend [this article](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/shades-of-gray-sex-gender-and-fairness-in-sport/), which goes into much more detail about the gender performance gap in different sports and how this relates to transgender athletes.",

Meaning the reduction in muscle density needed to reach cis female ranges is lower than their quoted 40% difference of men and women.

Being trans is no more a choice than being born with double-jointed elbows, in case that was somehow in doubt.\n\nThank you for asking this. I hate how we somehow only care about biological differences when it involves gender, be it someone who is trans or someone cis with naturally high levels of T like Caster Semenya. The rest of the advantages people are born with just fly out the window. \n\nI‚Äôm a short, clumsy cis woman with asthma and, like most people, there was just never any chance I was going to end up an elite athlete. But no one cares about the countless number of biological factors that influence athletic performance. Only sex. Trans women aren‚Äôt out there winning athletic competitions by the truckload because someone‚Äôs birth sex and hormone levels are not the only factors involved in athletic performance. But they seem to be the only ones that people lose their shit over. \n\nThe other thing that I never see anyone mention‚Äîespecially in the context of school-age kids‚Äîis the fact that winning is not everything. We teach kids to be good sports and spout platitudes like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about winning, it‚Äôs about doing your best,‚Äù and we accept all kinds of unfairness in sport because that‚Äôs just life. But when a trans person is involved, suddenly everyone becomes both an endocrinologist and a member of the fairness police. The point is, even if it was true that trans women have a gigantic advantage in sports and would win everything (even though they don‚Äôt and we know this just isn‚Äôt a thing), why is winning the only factor anyone ever seems to consider?\n\nSomeone could be the 2nd best women‚Äôs gymnast ever but because she‚Äôs the same age as Simone Biles, she might never win a gold medal even though she would have won one in every other Olympics. This isn‚Äôt fair. But we don‚Äôt throw a fit and go on about how Simone is depriving other people of winning by being good. \n\nTrans people are murdered, bullied, and rejected by their families much, much more often than cis people. Those are just examples‚Äîacross the board life is harder for trans people than cis people. It kills me every time I see a story about some trans athlete being excluded or people throwing a fit about her participating, especially when it‚Äôs a high school kid. Maybe the lessons of sportsmanship for everyone involved might just be a tad more important in this situation than winning? \n\nIt‚Äôs bitterly ironic that in the debate about the ‚Äúscience‚Äù and whether it‚Äôs fair to let trans women compete alongside cis women, everyone is soooo concerned about whether the trans woman is causing an unfair disadvantage to cis people, but no one ever seems to care about the many unfair disadvantages that our cis-normative society causes to trans people. \n\nBasically, why do us couch potatoes care SO much about whether a trans women participates in sports but not about whether our government and local law enforcement participate in actually trying to stop trans women from being murdered?",

I plotted her total weight lifted against her body weight, along with the record total weights of women 35-39 against all the other bodyweight categories. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/myLcx0H) the plot.\n\nWhat I notice immediately from that plot is that if you predict the record weight lifted by the bodyweight of the lifter, Ms. Hubbard is *underperforming* for her weight relative to the women in the lower weight categories. That is, if you fit a line to the first 9 points, it would predict that she should be able to lift more than she actually did. \n\nThis tells me that what we actually need to be properly inclusive for women's sports like lifting is more weight categories, and hopefully also some kind of relative scoring system like they use in power lifting to determine the \"best overall\" lifter across weight classes.

It's more all eyes on that individual as opposed to team sports? \n\nAdding my two cents to this convo and this is my view. I think I'm going to be asking some teammates / coaches for their opinions as well cause I'm just curious. I may have a super simple outlook on everything. But for background, I play team sports (soccer/football) and while I'm not at like competitive level, I've played with people who've played post secondary in Canada, played in NCAA Div 1 teams, played pro/semi-pro and highest level amateur.  But I truly don't see why it's an issue if a MtF athlete played (they could be good pre-transition to being female in the game now). As any athlete regardless of gender, you hopefully want to be the best and, maybe it's because I'm not challenging for the best in the best in the world that I don't see an issue. But I honestly see it like a younger player that's coming up who's better than you or challenging for your spot. There are cis females who kick my butt at my sport that I've put a stupid amount of hours training and playing that are \"biologically superior\" to me. Sometimes they're faster, they're stronger and they're taller (or a combination of just flat out better than me in everyway)....and they're cis female. The way I see it, if I'm aiming for the top, doesn't matter who's there and if I'm somehow at the top, there's a billion other female chasing to be better than me, what's one more? Even on the men's side you have two top athletes in Messi and Ronaldo that have different physical attributes. I'm wondering if it's also because possibly in a larger team sport like soccer, you can 'go around' that player? For other people who play different team sports such as basketball where it's 5 players on the court at once, is being able to go around a player possible? \n\nSorry for the long speel, I'm honestly just curious as to why people think it's unfair. I get jealous of players who are faster and stronger than me and you learn to deal with players with those different attributes where they're, say in my obvious case, faster than me. It's like that at all levels, you see it at pro levels where someone flat out sprints around someone and still gets the ball and yet we say, oh wow, look at that speed.",

    "body": "This post is the culmination of over a decade of research, testing, and persistence in advancing KP treatments and our understanding of this condition. Like so many of you, I have met with countless dermatologists across the country and sunk significant money into trying to effectively treat this condition. I wholeheartedly believe that this theory and the treatments I have proposed are the most effective and up to date options for reducing the severity of Keratosis Pilaris.¬†\n\nKeratosis Pilaris is not caused by keratin buildup in the skin. Keratin buildup around the follicle is one of the last symptoms to develop in a series of cascading symptoms.\n\nHi everyone- my name is Devin Beaubien (u/Poem\\_KP) and I moderate the r/keratosis subreddit.¬†\n\nI've been researching Keratosis Pilaris and trying to understand what the condition is, why I have it, and how I could improve my situation for well over a decade. I've been pushing harder than ever on this research since my son developed KP as a toddler that was much more severe than mine was at the same age. In these past 5 years I believe I‚Äôve discovered and developed a highly effective U.S. Patent Pending treatment to target the underlying barrier defects and inflammation/redness of KP. This was done through extensive testing and research, first by myself in a home-based lab, and then through partnering with a commercial R&D lab that helped me to formalize what I had developed.¬†\n\nI have compiled all of my extensive research and cited sources into the following article on my website here: [https://smoothkp.com/blogs/news/keratosis-pilaris-pathology-a-working-theory](https://smoothkp.com/blogs/news/keratosis-pilaris-pathology-a-working-theory)\n\nThis post will attempt to summarize my proposal on the pathology of KP, treatment options, and why KP is such a misunderstood skin condition. At the time of posting, I believe that this KP theory is the most comprehensive research article ever compiled on Keratosis Pilaris.¬†\n\nIn the simplest terms, Keratosis Pilaris is a very common skin condition that begins with a single underlying root cause. That root cause is located in the epithelial skin barrier around the hair follicle where the barrier has cellular ‚Äúgaps‚Äù (for lack of a better term) that allow moisture to escape and bacteria and allergens to pass into the skin, triggering an immune response. This barrier abnormality occurs well before keratin begins forming in the follicle.¬†\n\nThere are multiple KP symptoms that build on top of one another. From my research they follow this pattern:\n\n1. Skin cells fail to secrete lipids during maturation\n2. Skin barrier around the follicle is compromised\n3. Inflammation develops\n4. Sebaceous glands shrink and atrophy\n5. Hair follicles become brittle and curled\n6. Keratin accumulates in the follicle (creating the bumps)\n7. When inflammation recedes from the follicle it leaves behind post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\nNearly all treatments for KP are attempting to improve the texture of KP by chemically exfoliating the keratin buildup in the follicle (6), but since they do not adequately address all of the barrier issues or sebaceous gland shrinkage, the best results that you can expect to achieve are going to be texture improvements. Applying glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, and/or retinol to a compromised skin barrier is not going to do much for improving redness and inflammation. In fact it may very well do the opposite.¬†\n\nWhile moisturizing the skin will help soften and reduce some dryness around the follicles, it‚Äôs a losing battle if your skin is not producing enough sebum (skin oil) to moisturize and protect your follicles.¬†\n\nThis next part is going to be complicated and represents the bulk of my research on KP. What I cover here is delved into with much more depth in the article I linked at the beginning (and end) of this post.¬†\n\nI theorize that the barrier issues we see in KP are the direct result of deficient IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1) levels in skin tissue, combined with genetic mutations of Insulin growth factor receptors and the underlying cellular signaling pathways that regulate how skin cells mature and differentiate as they move through the layers of the skin.¬†\n\nConsider the following:¬†\n\n* Studies testing IGF-1 inhibition result in a disrupted epidermis that looks strikingly like the barrier disruption seen in KP.\n* IGF-1 and its effects on skin cells directly regulate skin cell maturation as the cells travel through the skin. Deficiency in IGF-1 and:or mutations in Insulin receptors would directly affect the skin cell as it differentiates and secretes lipids during the formation of the skin barrier around the SC-SG interface, which is exactly where we see barrier issues appearing in KP.\n* This study identified mutation of cellular pathways (triggered by IGF-1) resulting in the development of KP: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/)\n* IGF-1 levels are lowest in children and steadily increase as you age, correlating with how we see KP improve in some children as they age\n* IGF-1 levels raise while we sleep, with sleep being crucial to hormone production. This correlates with people reporting that their KP appears less severe in the mornings upon waking.\n* IGF-1 levels decrease and sebaceous glands are atrophied when undergoing Isotretinoin (Accutane) treatment. This correlates with the numerous reports we‚Äôve seen in r/keratosis of people experiencing increased severity of KP after taking Accutane.¬†\n* IGF-1 levels are affected by pregnancy during increased estrogen production and additional hormonal factors. This correlates with reports of KP severity changes during and post pregnancy.\n* PCOS and other conditions that affect insulin resistance also correlate with increased likelihood of KP development.\n* Diets that contain high glycemic foods (rapidly digested carbohydrates) and milk proteins can effect insulin resistance, providing a potential link for some between diet and KP that so often is reported in r/keratosis\n* Keratosis pilaris can result from Dupilumab for the treatment of bronchial asthma. IGF-2 stimulates the secretion of the Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 by 40-70%, while Dupilumab has been shown to inhibit the Th2 pathway. This reinforces the assertion that mutations in this cellular pathway and its signaling are direct causes in the pathology of KP.\n* KP prevalence correlates with obesity, which in turn correlates with insulin resistance.¬†\n* IGF-1 is also responsible for the regulation of lipogenesis, which is thought to occur through IGF-1‚Äôs effects on 5Œ±-Reductase and the enzymatic process responsible for converting testosterone into DHT, which stimulates sebocyte proliferation. IGF-1 effective regulates sebum production in the skin.\n\nI could continue but at this point I think you are probably seeing the same patterns I see.¬†\n\nIGF-1 is also partially responsible for inhibiting inflammation via stimulation of IL-10 production which I believe is important for people suffering from KPRF, a subtype of KP affecting the face with visible redness and flushing of the cheeks.¬†\n\nSo to summarize, IGF-1 and its related cellular pathways are connected directly or is one step removed from every symptom experienced by those with KP. Deficiency in IGF-1 and IR mutation also correlates with all of the events that are known to affect KP development and severity.¬†\n\nCoincidence? I think not!¬†\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac89j3giowle1.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4247f2ee20e5cb95462a0e6c6d4b70d1f37c851\n\nSo the big question is how do we improve IGF-1 bioavailability in skin tissue to prevent barrier issues from forming, thereby preventing KP symptoms?\n\nFor this, I believe I have a very compelling answer.¬†\n\nHere is my arm with severe KP before and after applying this treatment for stimulating IGF-1 production in my skin through a topical lotion I developed:\n\n[My arm after 12 weeks of continued twice daily application of topical RK & Indirubin ](https://preview.redd.it/3qo9em8anwle1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8b0132e5481b44f870e74948fb20aa75f6afdc6)\n\nInitially in my research I was testing multiple compounds on my skin to determine their effectiveness on my KP. I finally settled on two specific compounds:\n\n**Raspberry Ketone:** The aromatic compound in red raspberries has been studied for topical application and has been shown to stimulate significant IGF-1 production in skin tissue through sensory neuron activation.\n\n**Indirubin (Indigo Naturalis):** An anti inflammatory that reduces keratinocyte proliferation and cytokine production in the skin.¬†\n\nBy combining these ingredients into a jojoba oil base (which is a plant extracted oil that is¬†¬†chemically similar to human sebum) I believe I have created the most effective skincare topical for regulating Keratosis Pilaris. This topical solution was also iterated on to balance pH and add the lowest effective concentration of lactic acid to help turn over skin cells without irritation, reducing pigmentation that has occurred due to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.¬†\n\nLike I said in the beginning of this post, I wholeheartedly believe that this theory and the treatments I have proposed are the most effective and up to date options for reducing the severity of Keratosis Pilaris. I have seen incredible results in my own KP and well as my son‚Äôs. I have also shared this treatment with a number of people through informal product trials and have received amazing feedback. No other treatment like this has existed until today, because no other KP treatments/products have been focused on anything except exfoliation and skin cell turnover. \n\nPlease take some time to dive into my research and see the evidence for yourself. I‚Äôd love to see what everyone thinks of this passion project, it's taken a lot of energy to get here and I am very excited to be sharing all of this with you! Thank you so much for reading!\n\n**TL;DR:** I believe I connected the dots, identified the root cause of Keratosis Pilaris and developed a solution that corrects all of the cascading symptoms of KP.¬†I have compiled all cited sources into a blog I published [HERE](https://smoothkp.com/blogs/news/keratosis-pilaris-pathology-a-working-theory) and summarized the findings on this webpage [HERE](https://smoothkp.com/pages/learn)\n\nUPDATE: All of you that have decided to try out this lotion, first of all thank you for taking a chance on me and this project üôè and secondly all orders sent in this past Friday + this Weekend will be dropped off at USPS Monday (tomorrow) morning. I am anxiously awaiting everyone‚Äôs feedback on how their KP responds to this lotion ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nUPDATE 2: Still waiting on a couple of items to come through for international shipping! There were a couple of unseen hurdles to get through, waiting on approval from payment providers in key markets, but as soon as that goes through we will be available in 150+ countries. Sorry for the delay- appreciate the patience üôè\n\nUPDATE 3: For all that showed interest outside of the USA- International shipping is available if you want to try out this theory üëç",

I'm taking notes üòä  \n\nI've also been wondering whether KP is improved by decreasing inflammation and allowing the skin barrier to repair itself. Because I have a few skin conditions in addition to KP (namely, seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea) and they have driven me through years of painful trial and error of products from head to toe. What cleared the seborrheic dermatitis tended to irritate my KP and rosacea, but what was gentle enough to calm down my KP and rosacea tended to flare up my seborrheic dermatitis. It's a Catch-22.  \n\nSo the solution I've converged on is an avoidance approach. I start with \"Malassezia safe\" products, and add more filters for ingredients that I've observed to cause skin barrier disruption or inflammation. These are primarily certain surfactants and topical actives (which are frustratingly pervasive on the market), plus a few contact allergens.  \n\nIt hasn't cured my KP as I still have sporadic keratin plugs on my arms. But it vastly calms down the follicles and it's not as widespread as it used to be. It's there if I look at it, but I no longer have itching and inflammation stealing my attention, which was important for quality of life with these already frustrating other conditions.",

I am 50 yo and completed 4 or 5 rounds of accutane since my college years for mild/moderate cystic acne. Each round helped  for 1-2 years but acne always returned. Interesting, 6 months prior to onset of my current condition I had initiated low dose, long-term Accutane therapy during which time my current condition hit me with a ton of bricks. I quit Accutane and have been trying to resolve this with every possible solution for the last several years with no change.\n\nA couple of recent developments of interest : I recently bought a black light out of curiosity to see if there would be any fluorescence that might give a clue to what is happening to my skin. I was shocked to see bright, orange/pink fluorescent spots in each keratin plug. I learned that this is characteristic of a sub type of C acnes bacteria that is associated with or causes acne (technically an imbalance of this subtype vs the c. acnes subtype in normal skin flora- the ‚Äònormal‚Äô type does not fluoresce ). how this is possible at my age I have no idea! \n\nAlso, around the same time I tried a product with 6% resorcinol and was shocked by its effectiveness. It completely obliterated the rough, sandpaper like layer of skin- much better than urea or any of the many other acids/ moisturizers I‚Äôve tried over the years. However, it did not resolve the underlying issue of follicular keratin proliferation and in some sense has exacerbated the problem because the inflamed keratin spots are closer to the surface now.\n\nAnyway, if you got this far, thank you for reading. I am very curious to know how my experience fits with your theory!",

    "body": "I have had LC for 2.5+ years, since March 2022. Before LC, I was an extremely healthy 23M marathon runner. My acute infection was quite mild - no hospitalization or anything like that. I had a variety of symptoms in the beginning (heart problems, vision issues, memory issues, and nerve problems), but those for the most part either went away or became too unimportant to pay attention to within the first year. However, I have had a continuous, aggressive, downward decline with regard to physical activity and PEM, and was diagnosed with LC/CFS. What started out as a small feeling of fatigue grew and grew into a soul crushing inability to get out of bed, where I have been for the past year. More important than the fatigue was the PEM - any time I would push myself above my exertion threshold, I would pay for it for anywhere from days in the best case to weeks in the worst case. It felt like poison, lactic acid, and a crazy immune response all rolled up into one, and is the most painful thing I have ever experienced in my life. I want to emphasize the PEM component here because it has been by far the biggest symptom, and every time I have looked on this subreddit at recovery stories they almost never describe having PEM. It seems to be the case that without pharmacological intervention, the recovery rate for LC-induced CFS is extremely low. I realized this a while ago, which is why I quit my job to study immunology and figure out how to fix myself.\n\nIn the past 2.5 years, I have tried so many things with no success. I have taken pretty much every supplement that is normally mentioned here, plus a bunch more. I‚Äôm not going to list them because there are so many. I also tried triple anticoagulant therapy, LDN, and was part of two clinical trials. The first trial was the Hope Bio stem cell trial, which I was confirmed in the treatment arm. This did nothing for me, and I continued to get worse and worse during the trial (not more than usual, but the story of the last two years has been a gradual, steady decrease in my baseline after every crash). I also took part in the UCSF monoclonal antibody trial, which has not yet concluded but will be unblinding soon. I received the infusion in January, and am well beyond the 6 month follow up. For those of you who may see this post and think that the mAbs might have been the reason for my recovery - it was NOT. The mAbs (which I don‚Äôt even know if I got) would have had a noticeable effect within the first 2-3 months max, and once again they had zero positive impact. During the trial, I continued to get worse. For reference, they routinely asked me to subjectively rate my health, and I consistently answered anywhere from 3 to 5‚Ä¶ out of 100. I cannot emphasize enough how severe I have been, and that NOTHING I did ever moved the needle. At all.\n\nWhich brings me to the good news. A bit over 8 weeks ago, I started taking rapamycin, at a dosage of 5 mg per week, prescribed by the longevity company Healthspan (I went with them instead of AgelessRx because AgelessRx requires you to be over 40, and I am 25). Normally, I think people titrate up, but I didn‚Äôt get any instructions to do so, and just went for it at 5 mg. Before starting, as I mentioned, I was completely bedbound and had an extremely low baseline. For reference, I couldn‚Äôt type or use the remote controller to play video games because the amount of energy expended was too high. I would spend basically all day in bed, unable to move. Within the first 24 hours of starting rapamycin, I experienced what felt like an immunological exorcism. I felt extremely inflamed and had the worst headache I have felt in a long time. Whatever was happening, it was extremely noticeable. I‚Äôll go into detail down below on what I believe was actually happening but for now I‚Äôll tell you the rest of what happened. This headache and associated inflammation feeling lasted for 3 full days (the half life of rapamycin is quite long, at 80+ hours). Within that first week, I started to feel a feeling I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time. Instead of my muscles feeling oxygen starved, I started to feel like the oxygen was returning and they had more energy. I was far too afraid to push anything too quickly, though, so I stayed in bed and continued to rest. The next week when I took the second dose, the same headache and inflammation returned, albeit at a fraction of the intensity, maybe 25%. The same thing happened the week after, and the week after that, until I no longer noticed any differences before and after taking the drug. During this time, something strange happened: multiple times, I accidentally overexerted myself and awaited the incoming PEM, but woke up the next day and felt totally fine. Intrigued, I continued to test my limits in week 3 and found that nothing I did was causing PEM. From that week onwards I really started pushing and worked up to shooting hoops by week 6. Once again, no PEM. At week 8 now, I exercise multiple times a day and have no problems with fatigue at all. I have some serious deconditioning from lack of activity over the past couple of years, but I haven‚Äôt had any PEM since starting rapamycin. I am quite certain that my metabolism is fine now and the only thing holding me back is my deconditioning. I will continue to update you over the next few months as I continue to improve, but the bottom line is this: I went from bed bound with PEM to playing basketball with no PEM within 6 weeks, after 2.5 years of being extremely ill with CFS-type LC. If that‚Äôs not a success story, I don‚Äôt know what is. This drug has been nothing short of a miracle.\n\nHow did I land on rapamycin? Since I was part of the monoclonal antibody trial, I have gotten to speak with the researchers at UCSF in depth about the kinds of things they are seeing in the lab, and also bounce my hypotheses off of them. After talking with them for a while, it was clear that the probability of CFS-type LC being an antibody/B cell mediated autoimmune disease was very low: all of the antibody screens have come up pretty much clean (look into PhIP-Seq to see how this is done). But autoimmunity still seemed plausible to me, so if there is autoimmunity going on, it very well might be mediated by T cells (unlike antibodies, it is extremely hard to identify auto reactive T cells unless you have a hypothesis about specific epitopes being targeted). I noticed that any time I would get an acute viral infection (a cold, RSV, or even just a night of really bad sleep), my fatigue would seem to improve, which may have been due to an increase in T regulatory cell activity and proliferation. T regulatory cells are responsible for peripheral tolerance mechanisms (read: counteracting T cell autoimmunity), so I looked for drugs which might be able to replicate this effect. Lo and behold, I identified rapamycin as a candidate. In addition to being pretty safe, it was also cheap and accessible due the recent advent of online longevity pharmacies. So I went online and it was at my door within 2 weeks. I didn‚Äôt start it though until I talked to the researchers at UCSF, who told me their opinions on the drug. While they legally couldn‚Äôt advise me whether to try it, they did tell me that it was a very interesting drug with several potentially beneficial mechanisms in addition to the one I was interested in. Furthermore, they told me that the drug was interesting enough for them to be interested in a trial, but the funding fell through twice so they were unable to move forward. This was all the confirmation I needed that this was a drug worth trying, so I went ahead and took it.\n\nHere‚Äôs the catch: after looking into the various mechanisms of rapamycin, I am now not sure if the reason it has worked for me is the reason I selected it. It could, of course, work by increasing T regulatory cell activity and reversing T cell mediated autoimmunity as I had guessed, but there are several other mechanisms which also seem plausible to me. Interestingly, rapamycin happens to be a potent antifungal. I did not expect to have the headache/inflammation reaction upon taking rapamycin, and believe that feeling may well have been a Herxheimer reaction in response to the drug clearing out a gut-based fungal infection (likely candida or aspergillus). Fungal infections are known to be associated with CFS, but the weird thing to me is that I knew this before and went on an anti fungal protocol on the off chance this was happening with me. This was over a year ago. It‚Äôs possible that the protocol I was on was not strong enough (it was all supplements, no prescription drugs), and I now wonder what would have happened had I tried another class of drug (like azoles) which are much more potent antifungals. In a similar line of thinking, rapamycin has an antibacterial effect and may have cleared out a latent bacterial infection. In addition to being antibacterial and antifungal, it may also inhibit viral replication through targeting host protein synthesis machinery. Moreover, rapamycin can trigger large amounts of apoptosis in senescent cells, which is an alternative explanation for my perceived Herxheimer reaction. Maybe I cleared a bunch of cells with damaged mitochondria and poor metabolic machinery, or maybe it allowed my immune system to clear out cells functioning as a viral reservoir for COVID. It could be that all of these are related - COVID can wreak havoc on the microbiome and make your gut more susceptible to fungal infections. It can also make your gut more permeable, and a leaky gut can lead to autoimmmunity. I just don‚Äôt know - we need more data. This drug seems to have so many different beneficial mechanisms. It‚Äôs not entirely without its faults, though; in high, regular doses, it can be an immunosuppressant and lead to increased vulnerability to viral infections (hence why it is used to prevent donor organ rejection). At the dosage that I am at, I am not too worried about this, and there is good evidence suggesting that a weekly dosing schedule avoids the bulk of the immunosuppressive effect in favor of the desired mechanisms. The other thing that you have to worry about is drug interactions - rapamycin does interact with many different drugs, so it is VERY important to make sure there are no bad interactions before taking it.\n\nI have been in contact with the researchers at UCSF during my miraculous recovery, and they have been so excited by my case that they had me come back out to get blood drawn so they could compare it before and after rapamycin (they already had my blood from before since I was in their clinical trial) to look for biomarkers or any differences which might indicate a positive change.¬†Last week, I had the chance to talk with some other high profile figures in the LC research community, and I learned that there will be an upcoming clinical trial for rapamycin in early 2025. It's clear at this point that lots of people in the research community are interested in this drug. It may not help everybody (because Long COVID is a huge umbrella term with potentially many different mechanisms in play), but it seems like it can certainly help a subset of LC patients suffering from severe PEM like myself.\n\nI will continue to take the drug and keep riding the road to recovery and will return here to post an update every once in a while, or if anything interesting happens. In the meantime, I am happy to answer anyone‚Äôs questions and offer what support I can. Feel free to DM me if you want to talk!\n\nTLDR: I (25M) went from bed bound LC/CFS (with severe PEM) to running around playing basketball within 6 weeks of starting rapamycin after 2.5 years of being sick. This has been the only thing that has worked, and it is nothing short of a miracle. There are several different proposed mechanisms for why rapamycin may be working, and the researchers are studying my blood to find out what happened. Clinical trials coming early 2025.",

        "body": "When I read about candida infections and COVID in the middle of my LC last year, I looked at rapamycin.  Because of the side effects, I went looking for an alternative and found it: Berberine.  I began taking it about two months before my LC lifted.  I also had the PEM LC symptoms. (and all of the other symptoms that characterize ME/CFS, plus more symptoms that are more like MS.  I was also trying other supplements at the same time to treat LC so I can't tease them apart as to which one exactly was the cause of my recovery.  I did notice that Berberine reduces my blood sugar level by a noticeable but not alarming amount.  I didn't experience any side effects from berberine.  I've had COVID three times since the end of my LC and taken Berberine along with other supplements and haven't had a recurrence of LC.\n\nIt would be great if researchers could do both a rapamycin and berberine study on different research arms against a common placebo arm.\n\nThank you so much for sharing your story with all of the amazing detail.  I'm so glad that you're feeling better and able to share your journey with everyone else.\n\nEDIT: I'm taking one capsule in the morning and again in the evening. Each capsule has 450mg of Berberine HCL and 550mg of Berberine Phytosome.  I landed on this dosage after researching it's affects on Total Cholesterol. Lower levels of cholesterol are correlated with better outcomes in another study I read.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25310356/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25310356/)\n\n\"Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from medicinal plant species, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine with no significant side effects. Recent research has demonstrated that berberine has anticancer activity against various types of cancer, mediated through the suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).\"\n\n[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9526677/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9526677/)\n\n\"One of the most used herbal medicines is berberine (BBR), which has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, and immune-regulatory effects; thus, BBR may be a prospective candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review found that BBR has anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects with mitigation of associated inflammatory changes. BBR also reduces the risk of ALI/ARDS in Covid-19 patients by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory signaling pathways. In conclusion, BBR has potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral effects. Therefore, it can be utilized as a possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. BBR inhibits the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 and attenuates the associated inflammatory disorders linked by the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways.\"\n\n[https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1096383/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1096383/full)\n\n\"As far as antifungal is concerned, berberine can either directly inhibit *C. albicans* or act as a sensitizer to enhance the antibacterial effect of FLU against *C. albicans*.\"",

The pregnancy has made most of my LC symptoms go away, especially anything related to palpitations after eating certain foods. After delivery, my resting heart rate has also gone back down to what my healthy self before LC had (60s vs 90s). What i knew happend in pregnancy was DAO levels in the gut are incresed 1000x to protect the fetus from histamine. LC also brought me all of these allergies like to pollen, smoke, chocolate... But supplementing DAO after birth hasnt done much for me. Now i read about regulatory T cells. I never knew anything about these but apparently they also play a huge part in protecting the fetus and their number is regulated by pregnancy hormones. The fact that the LC \"cure\" effect of my pregnancy started to wear off by the time my hormones started to regulate, might indicate that it could be these regulatory T cells that were responsible for me being able to eat everything and anything and generally feeling great.\n\nFascinating!",

I have CFS as well so I thought I‚Äôd offer some insight to all you chronically ill nerds:\n\nRapamycin is an mTOR inhibitor. mTOR regulates a TON of cellular functions, and is, in a nutshell, the center of multiple nutrient sensing pathways. It‚Äôs an exceptionally interesting pathway because it exists in 2 complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. Rapamycin directly inhibits mTORC1 and INdirectly inhibits mTORC2. Rapamycin only inhibits mTORC2 under chronic exposure and this is the key in terms of immunomodulation. \n\nI think it‚Äôs unlikely there are substantial immunomodulatory effects at this dosage (if my understanding is correct that you‚Äôre taking 5mg 1X per week). The effector T cell/Treg changes only occur under chronic exposure to rapa, so 1X a week at low dose is not likely to cause an increase in Tregs.\n\nI have to concur with the autophagy hypothesis (it would not necessarily be apoptosis which is complete cell death and most studies relating apoptosis & rapa are high dose in cancer; whereas autophagy is recycling of damaged cellular components) because acute inhibition of mTOR promotes autophagy. I think COVID and other viruses that induce CFS are very metabolically stressful (vitamin depletion, induction of diabetes, mitochondrial dysfunction in CFS, etc) , leading to mitochondrial damage, increased reactive oxygen species production, and inhibition of mitophagy (autophagy specifically in mitochondria) these things have all been implicated in senescence.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction can cause low-grade systemic inflammation and when you exert yourself, you‚Äôre basically forcing an old car to drive uphill. All you‚Äôre doing is producing fumes, not getting anywhere, and your car is likely to give out.\n\nKick starting autophagy with acute mTOR inhibition can force cells to repair the damage (like getting a new engine). \n\nNow in regards to the Herxheimer reaction, I‚Äôm no expert in fungal diseases so I won‚Äôt speak to that. I agree that the strange reaction MUST in some way be related to LC/CFS, whether it‚Äôs from being more susceptible to gut imbalance or clearing out all the old cell parts through autophagy.\n\nIt‚Äôs all so interesting.

        "body": ">After talking with them for a while, it was clear that the probability of CFS-type LC being an antibody/B cell mediated autoimmune disease was very low: all of the antibody screens have come up pretty much clean (look into PhIP-Seq to see how this is done). But autoimmunity still seemed plausible to me, so if there is autoimmunity going on, it very well might be mediated by T cells (unlike antibodies, it is extremely hard to identify auto reactive T cells unless you have a hypothesis about specific epitopes being targeted).\n\nThis to the bone. I've reached a similar hypothesis after tons of deep dives into research papers and observing this community for years. Those with CFS type LC tend to have normal antibody level, and as you have mentioned it could be T-cell mediated autoimmunity, whereas those with dysautonomia/pots subtype tend to have antibody (bcell mediated) autoimmunity. I've posted about Th1 and Th2 shift theory, and this definitely aligns with it.\n\n- Th1 dominance autoimmunity > CFS type\n- Th2 dominance autoimmunity > dysautonomia\n\nWhat is your lymphocytes # on CBC? \n\nCould it be both antibody and tcells? Maybe. Ofc, this is oversimplification, but I really wished they looked into this further.\n\nEdit: This is also why I tend to think that upcoming potential treatments like BC007 may be better suited for those with antibodies-type autoimmunity.

When you feel great, you look your best, your skin is glowy and resilient, spring has sprung, vasant rithu (spring season) is ON! üòÜüòÜüòÜ You'll have that inner Glow, and your skin's healing ability is at an all-cycle high! \n\n* It's time to try new products! Using something new at this point in your cycle gives it the best possible shot. It's also the best time to start an active like vitamin C, that can be irritating. Yes, you may still experience irritation in the coming weeks, but it gives you the best possible start üò§ If something breaks you out this week, it *breaks you out*. It simply does *not* suit you. \n\n* Pain tolerance is also at an all-time high, so this is the best time to get waxed, threaded, etc. Not only will it hurt less, but you'll experience less irritation, and you'll heal from what irritation you do get much faster! \n\n* Ditto for any procedures like extractions, microneedling, laser, peels - hell, even actual surgical procedures! If you have the option to choose when to schedule them, pick this week in your cycle. \n\n#üåó DAY 14/MID-CYCLE: Ovulation - Clear pores and prevent acne\n\n*Highest estrogen, low progesterone, bump in testosterone*\n\n* A spike in testosterone may cause a random pimple or two at this point, but it will heal fast, and you'll be at max glow still ‚ò∫\n\n* Acne that emerges during the second half of the cycle, during PMS, is a flaring up and inflammation of clogged pores that were *already* there. So NOW is the time, while your skin is still resilient, to focus on exfoliation and clear out all the clogged pores that would be NBD - if they didn't end up turning into acne at the end of the cycle üòÖ \n\n* The Ordinary/ Minimalist Peeling Solution! This is your time to shiiiine! üòÇ\n\n* Now is the time for a facial, Fiddysnails's [pore cleansing method](https://glowieco.com/blogs/news/fiddysnails-jude-chao-updated-pore-clearing-method-to-remove-sebaceous-filaments) (which became a trend called [\"gritting\"](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/gritting)), or simply a [meticulous, thorough oil cleanse](https://youtu.be/3z0YPACfhBk) to clear out clogged pores. \n\n* If you have active acne or redness, DO NOT do prolonged massage. You may spread bacteria and increase heat and inflammation. You can follow Fiddysnails's method, massaging LIGHTLY, no more than a minute, to oil cleanse - no longer than you would on a daily basis. The method will still be effective ‚ò∫\n\n* Some women may find they can do these steps in week 3, as well. Everyone's body is different. Observe your own skin, and adjust as per your own unique pattern of changes ü§ó‚ù§\n\n#üåî WEEK 3: Luteal Phase: Oil control \n\n*Lower estrogen, rising progesterone*\n\n* This is when you may start to experience oily skin. Some women may not experience this till the end of the week, or even the start of week 4, some may start getting oily as soon as they're done with ovulation. \n\n* This week is all about oil control and gentle chemical exfoliation. 'Tis the time for CLAY MASKS and BHAs. Some people's skin can handle oil cleansing massages during this phase, mine cannot ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have sensitive skin, so I keep massages for closer to ovulation time. \n\n* You could consider upping your cleansing game one notch. If you usually rinse with only water in the morning, a gentle cleanser might help. If you use gentle cleansers already, you skin might benefit from a foaming one during this half of your cycle. Might be some options to consider - remember to observe your skin condition. Your skin's response will tell you if you're causing too much dehydration! \n\n* You want to really be getting the most use out of your BHAs and niacinamide at this stage. If you use a BHA twice a week, you could add an extra day. Ditto niacinamide. If you're already using a BHA, an AHA or azelaic acid daily or regularly, don't overdo it, stick to adding a clay mask (or two) in there. If you have dry skin, maybe a lactic acid mask. You're already doing enough üòå\n\n* Over production of oil can be somewhat balanced by providing more hydration, to balance oil-water levels. More hydration, less emollients/occlusives! \n\n* Dialling back on the thick moisturisers is a good idea. Perhaps a plain aloe gel over your serum is enough. Maybe you just use *less* moisturiser. Skip the facial oils till after your period. Cut down the number of steps in your routine. There's a lot you can do to handle sebum production and prevent breakouts, simply by holding back on over-moisturising at this point. Less is definitely more! \n\n#üåî WEEK 4: Cool and soothe pre-menstrual inflammation\n\n*Low estrogen, high progesterone*\n\n* Your skin will now be peak sensitivity and oiliness, and you're probably breaking out üôÉ Autumn is upon us, and the body is withdrawing to deal with Very Important Inner Matters üßê\n\n* As in the menstrual phase, you wanna avoid new products. Use soothing products you know your skin likes. For me that's mixing a quarter teaspoon zinc oxide powder into my night moisturiser, with three or four drops MCT oil to offset the slight drying effect. My skin is visibly calmed the next morning üòå Work smarter, not harder! üòÇ‚ù§\n\n* Keeping your face cool helps calm and soothe breakouts, preventing them from getting worse. Doing soothing, cooling face packs - aloe, potato, cucumber, oats, gel packs... All of that really helps to prevent the sensitivity from resulting in actual pimples, and speeds healing. I have a [DIY gel masks post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/pq4apu/how_to_make_diy_gel_masks_with_xanthan_gum/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), if that interests you. \n\n* Even just soaking oats in water for a couple hours, and then blending them smooth, keeping that in the fridge. Amazing for soothing and cooling. Add some honey for extra hydration. Yum yum üòÇ\n\n* Keeping aloe gel in the fridge and doing a thick layer as a mask, then washing it off is the easiest option ü§î You could also get those DIY blank sheet masks and soak them in green or black tea and use those. If you have a sheet mask brand that suits you, using that after keeping it in the fridge... \n\n* Korean people talk about skin temperature all the time, and it's now become a mainstream thing - like how heat can trigger melanin production and worsen melasma and hyperpigmentation. Also, apparently a one degree Celsius increase in temperature can [increase sebum production by *ten percent*](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.glamour.com/story/how-to-combat-oily-shiny-skin-in-the-summertime/amp) ü§Ø Cooling your skin is really effective and underrated! HIGHLY recommend for those with inflammatory acne, redness, and sensitive skin, regardless of menstrual cycle. \n\n* Cooling does NOT mean using ice directly on your face, that shit can give you burst capillaries. Extreme temperatures are never a good idea for skin!\n\n* Continue to keep your skincare light if your skin is particularly oily. And sit tight ‚ù§ As with the seasons, this too is a phase that will pass üòå‚ù§\n\n#In summation:\n\nMany of us who have already come a long way to figure out our own skin probably do most of these things without consciously thinking about it. After a point, you do get to a place where you intuitively react to your skin's condition, how it looks, feels, and responds to touch. For some of us, this way of structuring might just be making a connection with our menstrual cycle we weren't previously consciously aware of doing. I hope you found something of interest or value to you here ‚ò∫ \n\nFor those who are struggling with acne and hormonal breakouts, perhaps this angle of approach may be a game changer! I know that not everyone has a regular menstrual cycle AT ALL, and PCOD/PCOS can make things seem totally unpredictable and out of control. Counter-intuitively, it might be observing your skin condition that gives you clues about your menstrual cycle, instead of the other way around! Even with a regular cycle, these guidelines are not hard and fast. Each phase rolls over into the next without clear demarcation, the labels are merely for ease of understanding üòÖ Hopefully you find some info here that helps you make the best of your personal situation and get to know your own personal patterns well ‚ù§\n\nViewing our bodies and our natural cycles as something to be conquered or ignored usually leads to resentment and anger towards ourselves, in my experience üòÖ It did for me, anyway. I was antagonistic towards my body. Competitive, rather than collaborative. There's a whole patriarchy angle to that, but I'm not gonna get into it üòÇ Embracing our feminine energy, and our connection with nature through our own bodies can be a profound, self-actualising journey on every level, and skin can be an amazing entry point to that. [Soft power!](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/12/15/case-for-south-korean-soft-power-pub-83406#:~:text=Clearly%2C%20South%20Korea's%202020%20wins,co%2Dopting%20rather%20than%20coercing.) üò§ South Korea knows what's up! \n\n\n\nHere are a few SKINCARE ARTICLES on the menstrual cycle, that I used as reference: \n\n‚ú® [Clean Beauty School article](https://cleanbeautyschool.com/cycle-syncing-skincare/) \n\n‚ú® [This Is When Your Skin Will Be Amazing, According To Your Period](https://medium.com/@GlowHQ/this-is-when-your-skin-will-be-amazing-according-to-your-period-6e368b7c6e8f) \n\n‚ú® [A good, simple infographic](https://preview.redd.it/g1xfteca0bw31.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c3d5477c9798c05cf81acb5375712f13007628c2) that sums it up. I got it from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dqmx7c/misc_anyone_with_a_menstrual_cycle_this_may/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), on r/SkincareAddiction üòÜüôèüèΩ\n\n‚ú® [Another infographic with specific hormone level percentages](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJgfn8DM4aw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) \n\n\n\nHere are a few ARTICLES ON CYCLE-SYNCING:\n\n‚ú® [The Menstrual Cycle: Nutrition, Training & Fat Loss](https://blog.ultimateperformance.com/the-menstrual-cycle-nutrition-training-fat-loss/) \n\n‚ú® [How To Be More Productive (Not Less!)

You can consult with your doctors if it is safe FOR YOU to try [seed cycling](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/seed-cycling), or take [evening primrose oil supplements](https://www.reliasmedia.com/articles/21335-evening-primrose-oil-for-symptoms-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-menopause) during the second half of your cycle. You can also check out r/PMDD.\n\nIf you're interested in being more aware and accepting of the emotional cycle that accompanies menstruation, the [Hormone Horoscope app](https://www.myhormonology.com/about/what-is-the-hormone-horoscope/) was super helpful for me, to be able to predict and adjust my behaviour and responses. It helped me get over my fear of PMDD and releasing control, by making things very matter-of-fact. Highly recommend! üòÜ‚ù§\n\nI, personally, used to be a lot more careful to track my period and sync my skincare, do seed cycling etc, when I was experiencing active acne and fungal acne, PMDD, severe mastalgia (breast pain) etc. My mental health has come a LONG way since then, resulting in a huge reduction in symptoms ‚ò∫üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ I've also gotten to understand my own skin and how to care for it.\n\nThese days, I'm not super careful about the skincare aspect. My acne is well under control. My routine provides good prevention and maintenance regardless of where I am in my cycle. I'll get a few small breakouts and do a few soothing face packs during week 4, mix in zinc oxide with my night moisturiser and that's it. I no longer do seed cycling, as I find taking evening primrose oil during the second half of my cycle reduces my PMDD symptoms to a manageable level. I'm super grateful to be able to relax now that my hard work and research has paid off üòÇüôèüèΩ\n\nIt's my hope that this will help some of y'all, too ü§ó‚ù§ Thanks for reading! Byeee!",

When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best.\n\n* The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.\n\n**Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!**\n\n*If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it. Cheers!*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/SkincareAddiction) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

I'd like to begin today by drawing everyone's attention to [this amazing piece] [i] by /u/llyon_matthew which was produced for the community free of charge.  Go shower him with love either here or on the discord because he very much deserves it!  High five to /u/osolodo for first comment on 78.  Now then I want everyone to find themselves a good chair, grab your popcorn, brew your coffee, get a beer, or whatever you feel like doing because ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...\n\n\\-----\n\n‚ÄòI grow increasingly worried that your hypothesis was correct sir,‚Äô Io said as they knelt before yet another mangled body, this one slumped awkwardly against a tree.\n\n‚ÄúWhat, because the last four weren‚Äôt enough to convince you?‚Äù  Winters shot back harshly as he punched the trunk with a fist, leaving Io silent and looking most hurt.  Winters took a deep breath and stood to his full height.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Io.  I haven‚Äôt seen the sun for days, I‚Äôm always cold, the legs are starting to burn, we can‚Äôt see shit in this snow, and this bastard keeps leaving us presents‚Ä¶ah those aren‚Äôt excuses.  I was out of line.  I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he apologized.  Io took it in stride.\n\n‚ÄòApology accepted sir.  Though your vitals are all still well within acceptable parameters I understand that these past few days have been most stressful and uncomfortable.  There have been many moments since I gained sapience where I wished I had a body of my own.  Now is certainly not one of them.  Your armor is quite comfortable from my perspective,‚Äô she ended with a thin smile.\n\n‚ÄúWell at least one of us is still having a good time,‚Äù he replied sourly, giving her a smile in return to ensure she knew he wasn‚Äôt blaming her for his bad mood.  ‚ÄúAnyway, what do you make of all of this Io?  We‚Äôve been getting closer.‚Äù  Io nodded and threw up a large map of the forest.  It was hardly detailed but the point was clear enough.  She‚Äôd marked out their approximate distance travelled and stopping point each morning.\n\n‚ÄòAs you can see, both us and the ursae decided to tail the remaining nomads, which ended up having us travel almost directly north for a couple of days.  Since the massacre the ursae has headed to the west.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs some small comfort.  If we can end this soon Veera and the others will have a shorter distance to travel,‚Äù Winters remarked, glancing over at the small point that marked their location as well as a wide area just to the west of them where Io was attempting to pinpoint the ursae‚Äôs location.  Over the past two days the cloud cover had grown denser and the snows thicker.  That night there was ample wind as well, whipping at his cloak and tugging at his survival pack.  ‚ÄúGods damn it all, this visibility is awful.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòI believe you should ready yourself sir,‚Äô Io advised darkly, her brow furrowed as she tried her hardest to make out anything she could through the almost blizzard conditions.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here?!‚Äù  Winters almost shouted, drawing his pistol. \n\n‚ÄòNo sir, but I believe it will not wait long if it intends to ever force a confrontation with us.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúWhy is that Io?‚Äù  Winters asked darkly, already feeling his head moving back and forth like a search light, scanning for absolutely anything out of place.  His spine tingled in the darkness, snow and wind causing movements and shadows to jump at him everywhere.  He‚Äôd rarely, if ever, felt so vulnerable in the Aegis.\n\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think it has the ability to outrun us, and I believe it understands that,‚Äô Io began.  ‚ÄòBarring the fact that humans are exceptional long distance trackers, the beast has recently eaten a tremendous amount of food.  For the last two days since you challenged it, it has been engaged in what I would consider a tactical retreat.  Look around us sir, we have crossed the border of its territory.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúNo offense Io, but I didn‚Äôt exactly see a demarcation line,‚Äù Winters offered sarcastically.\n\n‚ÄòUgh‚Ä¶du barbar.  You soldier types are always willing to run in and bash something over the head but unwilling to stop and see the forest for the trees,‚Äô Io lamented, shaking her head and waving her hand to indicate the woods around them.  ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt you see?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see a whole lot of anything right now Io!‚Äù  Winters retorted, growing impatient and on edge.  Every few seconds he checked Io‚Äôs ursae monitor, the magnitude of the bars growing ever larger as they walked on.  The frequency with which the signal was dropping entirely was making his stomach knot with apprehension.  ‚ÄúGet to the point!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòThe trees here are massive and have large spaces between them sir.  I believe we are in territory that this ursae, or perhaps more than one of them, have been curating for some time.  Most saplings are likely destroyed while the surviving ones grow large and free of other competitors.  No matter what size estimate for this beast ends up being correct, it needs a ton of space to maneuver.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúSo it made its own space,‚Äù Winters said, almost awestruck as he remembered how the forest itself had practically been destroyed around the nomad camp.  He didn‚Äôt feel like putting his pistol away anymore so he held onto it, keeping it at rest by his side as they walked on, both of their voices showing myriad signs of stress.\n\n‚ÄòYes sir, and it‚Äôs warned us to stay away as a first resort, though I get the uneasy feeling that we‚Äôre quickly forcing it into plan B.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúWhy bother though?  Why not just kill us?‚Äù  Winters asked, pleased that the ursae had not taken that route as of yet.\n\n‚ÄòAs you said sir, our ability to sneak up on it would not constitute the element of surprise in this case.  Instead, our very existence *is* the element of surprise.  To use an example you‚Äôre likely familiar with, the ursae is the undisputed bully of the Maran playground.  Now, suddenly, a new individual has appeared that refuses to cower in fear and slink through the trees to avoid it.  It likely thinks itself superior, if it considers such things at a conscious level at all, but it doesn‚Äôt *know* that it‚Äôs superior.  That, in and of itself, is an advantage.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúRight, and I‚Äôm sure it doesn‚Äôt want to fight on a full stomach,‚Äù Winters agreed with Io‚Äôs point from earlier.  ‚ÄúSo what you‚Äôre saying is that since we clearly haven‚Äôt heeded its warnings and it‚Äôs now retreated to friendly territory, it might decide that now is the time?‚Äù  At that moment Io‚Äôs sensors went dark and stayed that way.  Both of them froze.  ‚ÄúGod fucking damnit I really need to keep my mouth shut,‚Äù Winters whispered, watching Io as she frantically worked to try to resolve any sort of bead on their prey‚Ä¶or was it their hunter?  He began turning slowly in place, doing his best to lend his own eyes to Io‚Äôs efforts.  When many seconds went by and no detection occurred, Winters felt his body come alive with fear of the unknown and the beast in the night.  He rapidly holstered his pistol and knelt to the ground, practically throwing his spear and survival pack off of his shoulders.  It wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt trust Zolta‚Äôs craftsmanship, but now wasn‚Äôt the time for games.  A stray claw could hook under the straps or shatter the wooden shaft.  He had much more faith in his guns and sword.  What he didn‚Äôt have faith in was his visibility, taking a stand once more and scanning his surroundings, shield drawn and raised against his front.  If the ursae was really planning to attack them it couldn‚Äôt have chosen a better night.  Io was sweating and becoming increasingly desperate on his HUD as her projection kept looking anxiously between various displays.\n\n‚ÄòI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt find it sir!  It was right there just a second ago.  There‚Äôs too much wind‚Ä¶too much snow!  I‚Ä¶oh gods‚Ä¶oh gods we‚Äôre going to die aren‚Äôt we?‚Äô  Io cried as her biology finally caught up with her and her survival instincts overwhelmed subroutines devoted to calculations, sensors, and other higher level functions.  It was like her processors were screaming at her to get out.  ‚ÄòSir, please run!  I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want to die!‚Äô  She wailed, falling to her knees as Winters tried to keep his own mind steady.  He could feel the cold sweat dripping down his neck, his heart hammering practically outside of his own chest.  ‚ÄòBitte‚Ä¶ich will nicht sterben.‚Äô\n\nWinters allowed himself to close his eyes for a single breath.  ‚ÄúIo, look at me,‚Äù he demanded, continuing to scan around them as best he could.  Every tree and snow drift felt like it could somehow be hiding their pursuer.  The frightened woman did so, trying to calm herself but finding it nigh impossible.  ‚ÄúI know you can feel it, feel how utterly terrified I am right now,‚Äù he said, voice straining against his own vocal cords, coming out raspy and shaky.  It was true, she could feel it.  She could feel how fast and hard his heart was beating, sense how rapidly his breath was coming, see how enlarged his pupils were.  His body was doing everything it could to prepare itself for a fight to the death and yet he remained poised, turning slowly in the snow with his shield raised, waiting for the first sign of the enemy to determine what weapon to grasp with his right hand.  His legs were coiled and ready to spring, his fingers flexing constantly in and out of a fist.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die either Io.  And I don‚Äôt want you to die.  For us though that doesn‚Äôt mean running, doing what our bodies want to do.  It means standing and fighting,‚Äù he told her, swallowing hard as he began to step slowly towards one of the massive trees nearby, not bothering to take his other equipment with him.  If he died now he‚Äôd never need it again.  Io began flickering, but through it he thought he could see the fear in her eyes dim a bit.  When she resolved into a clear image she managed to stand, the action earning her the smallest twitch of his lips.\n\n‚ÄòThen I‚Ä¶I will stand and fight with you.  And if you die I will die with you,‚Äô she promised shakily.  The briefest of glances over to her image told him all he needed to know in spite of her uncertain voice.  She was as ready as she ever would be.  He could barely express what it meant to him to not be alone in that moment.\n\n‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶partner.‚Äù  Io materialized her armor and weapons at his words, reactivating her detection protocols.  She gazed up at him for just a moment, allowing herself the smallest sanctuary in the blizzard.\n\n‚ÄòIch liebe sie, Lieutenant,‚Äô she whispered.  Feeling a hundred emotions at once course through her as his face changed in response to her tone of voice.  She never heard his reply.  ‚ÄòSir!  From the right!‚Äô  Everything went red on Winters‚Äô HUD as he dived and rolled for his life, the ground and snow suddenly trembling around him as a massive volume of air above his body was displaced.  ‚ÄòOh my gods‚Ä¶oh my gods!‚Äô  Io cried.  \n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still alive, focus!‚Äù  Winters yelled, scrambling to his feet and whipping around to face their attacker where it had finally arrested the momentum of its sudden charge.  ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶my god.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòSir‚Ä¶ist das ein kolossaler Weltraumb√§r?‚Äô  Io asked, mouth agape.\n\n‚ÄúWhat?  English only during a firefight Io!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòIs that a colossal space bear?!‚Äô  She yelled, trying to scan the monstrosity for all she was worth.  Winters could do naught but shake his head.\n\n‚ÄúYeah Io, it‚Äôs a colossal fucking space bear.  And we‚Äôre gonna kill it!‚Äù  Winters roared, blood humming in his ears as he holstered his shield and grabbed his rifle, immediately taking aim at the creature‚Äôs eyes.  Like the rest of it they were pitch black, but with the minimal distance he was more than able to target them.  The beast had skidded to a halt about ten yards away from them before turning to face its rather elusive quarry.  For a moment Winters held his fire and Io stared in disbelief.  It was watching them without moving, its absolutely massive paws keeping it from sinking into the snow.  \n\n‚ÄòWhy do I get the feeling that nothing has ever dodged its attack before now?‚Äô  Io asked rhetorically.\n\n‚ÄúOh we‚Äôre going to do much more than that!‚Äù  Winters growled, pulling the trigger and sending a three round burst straight at the ursae‚Äôs left eyes.  He‚Äôd needed to aim slightly above parallel as the sheer height of the beast, Io‚Äôs readings indicated about fifteen feet at the apex of its spinal curve, meant that its head rested almost fully above him.  ‚ÄúGod damn you‚Äôre ugly!‚Äù  Winters yelled as his first shot struck home, causing the ursae to open its jaws wide in a deafening roar.  The living item was even more horrifying than the skull back in Ratha‚Äôs temple.  The skin of its cheeks and that between the mandibles of the lower jaw stretched tight as the beast cried out in pain and rage, turning from what had looked like some massive, grizzled beard into the opening of a cavernous maw lined with teeth that would surely grip and shred if it ever got a hold of him.  He didn‚Äôt even want to think about how most of them looked larger than his forearm, to say nothing of the size of the maw itself.  Instead he fired off two more bursts.  The first was completely swallowed by the beast‚Äôs throat while the second went high as the beast leaped at him with surprising speed, the bullets impacting the area between the shoulder blades and above the head.  ‚ÄúOh of course it‚Äôs fucking bullet resistant!‚Äù  Winters cried out as he hit the dirt again, firing off another couple of rounds from his back only to see them swallowed into darkness.  The ursae showed no signs of complaint beyond the wounds to the left side of its face.  Whatever damage had been done to its eyes had clearly not extended past the orbital socket.\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry I said that!‚Äô  Io yelled as she continued to try to gather data on the leviathan, looking every which way as the beast turned to them yet again.  Her hunt for any sort of weakness was not going well.\n\n‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù  Winters shot back.\n\n‚ÄòBack when we landed I jinxed it!‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúIrrelevant!  Just tell me where to shoot!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòThe other eyes!‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúYeah I would but are you seeing this?!‚Äù  Winters complained loudly, taking aim but finding his line of fire constantly disrupted by the ursae.  Having suffered two failed blitz attacks the beast was clearly taking stock and planning its next move, making sure to keep its wounded eyes facing him while rocking its head back and forth.  Winters couldn‚Äôt get a clear shot at the other two.  ‚ÄúFucking damnit!‚Äù  The HEL Jumper fired off a couple more bursts but they seemed to not do anything at all, even though he‚Äôd aimed them right at the middle of the skull.  All he earned for his efforts was a loud grunt of discontent and a stronger shake of the ursae‚Äôs massive skull.  The beast was shifting its weight back and forth on its paws as it contemplated what to do, its arms and legs sticking out partially from the sides of its body.  Its feet were simply too large to be fully contained underneath the thing.\n\n‚ÄòUh‚Ä¶keep trying?‚Äô  Io encouraged, not knowing what else they could do.  ‚ÄòMaybe you‚Äôll find a weak spot?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúIf shooting it in the mouth didn‚Äôt do it, I think the weak spots are all really far on the inside,‚Äù Winters lamented, pulling the trigger and firing off the remainder of his clip into various points on the ursae including the feet, legs, shoulders, and back.  All that served to do was take the animal from a state of irritation to rage as it staggered before charging him anew, rearing up just short of his position to arrest its momentum, intending to use reach instead of speed to subdue him.  ‚ÄúShit it‚Äôs fast!‚Äù  Winters yelled, diving onto his side.  He looked up just in time to see that he‚Äôd not gone far enough; the ursae was able to partially correct its downward trajectory given it was firmly planted on its hind legs.  With the sounds of Io‚Äôs screams in his ears Winters tucked and rolled as fast and far as he could through the snow, abandoning his rifle to be crushed under the broad paws of the beast.  Without his weapon the scramble to stand upright was made slightly easier, but he still struggled against the snows as his legs burned with the effort.  ‚ÄúDamn, I wish I had fucking snowshoes for feet right about now,‚Äù he raged as he stood upright, finding himself far closer to the ursae than he wanted to be.  He could make out the faint tracks of blood in the snow from its wounded eyes, but his attention was quickly pulled elsewhere as the ursae opened its mouth and lunged for him, the maw swallowing almost all of his field of vision.\n\n‚ÄòLook out!‚Äô  Io shouted as he pivoted and tried to dive again, lunging to his left.  A lance of pure and abject terror arced through him as the movement of his tailing right arm was arrested violently.  Whipping his head around they found his right gauntlet caught between rows of massive teeth, the clamping hold already gouging the metal and threatening to lift him off his feet.  He had fractions of seconds to react.\n\n‚ÄúIo, pop the seals now!‚Äù  Winters roared, drawing his knife and stabbing up high into one of the remaining good eyes the beast had, hoping to get in as much damage as possible if he was stuck next to the thing.  The satisfying feeling of his blade sinking into soft tissue was short lived as the ursae screamed in pain, a sound so furious he thought it was echoing inside his head.  He never got a chance to try for the last eye as the beast thrashed its head back and forth in an attempt to subdue and crush him like a ragdoll.  The force would have ripped his arm clean off but Io had obeyed his orders immediately, the force of the ursae instead sending him flying as his right hand slipped from its armor, leaving the gauntlet behind to fall from the beast‚Äôs massive jaws.  \n\n‚ÄòBracing for impact!‚Äô  Io yelled, encouraging Winters to do the same.  He cradled his now unprotected forelimb to his body as best he could, landing heavily in the snow before rolling to a stop as the breath was forced from his lungs.  ‚ÄòAre you alright sir?!‚Äô  Io asked urgently.  ‚ÄòPlease hurry!  He‚Äôs coming again!‚Äô  His head still spinning from the crash, Winters willed his body to move, muscles straining to work in synchrony as he climbed to his feet and sprinted for the relative shelter of a massive, nearby tree.  ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre trying to play hide and seek sir I‚Äôd like to remind you that this thing is nocturnal and probably doesn‚Äôt need its eyes at all to- Eep!‚Äô  Io‚Äôs eyes almost left her sockets as a massive paw wrapped around the tree from behind them in an attempt to crush them against the trunk.  Winters reacted on instinct with his pistol already in hand, the cold metal burning his unprotected fingers.  With the scream of a man who refused to die with unspent ammunition on his body, he slumped down as low as he could and unloaded rapidly into the underside of the ursae‚Äôs right foot, yelling like a berserker as he saw the rough skin on the bottom of the main pad finally give way after the third round.  As the fourth round finally found purchase in the exposed flesh and detonated the paw recoiled further and another roar deafened them, echoing through the surrounding forests.  \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about!‚Äù  Winters yelled, elation immediately cut short as the other side of tree was assaulted by furious, heavy blows.\n\n‚ÄòTalking about what?  Angering it more?!  It‚Äôs still using both of its paws!‚Äô  Io yelled as bark and wood chips rained around them, the creaking and groaning of wood beginning to fill their ears with dread.  The shower of detritus only stopped when the ursae was satisfied, rearing up to place both of its paws on the tree.  ‚ÄòShit, shit, shiiiit!‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me?!‚Äù  Winters barked, spinning off the tree to his right and finding himself under the beast as it finished felling the massive trunk.  Seeing an opportunity, Winters allowed the half-filled magazine to drop from his pistol, loading up a new one and immediately kneeling down and taking aim at the ankle of the paw he‚Äôd already shot at.  His world shook as the tree toppled to the earth and the ursae landed back on all fours above him, its midnight black fur blotting out everything, even the swirling snow.  Between its size and the momentary distraction the beast lost sight of him, though it quickly determined his position anew as rounds from Winters pistol began impacting the back of its leg.  ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, c‚Äômon!‚Äù  Winters pleaded as he fired at what he hoped was the skin just above a vital tendon or ligament.  The first five shots only gave him small flashes of light and the smell of burning fur, but eventually the tough hide gave way and he was able to sink multiple bullets into flesh in the span of a second or two.  By the time his trigger clicked to signify an empty magazine, Winters was sure he‚Äôd succeeded in his goal of crippling the leg.  He paid dearly for it.  The flaring pain from its ankle was more than enough to cause the ursae to begin flailing about in a wounded rage, the beast unable to comprehend how something so small could inflict so much damage without being killed.  Its injured paw caught Winters square in the chest on a backswing, the sickening sound of shredding armor filling the air as massive claws raked across his front.  Any happiness Winters might have felt at the paw size overestimating the size of the beast was quickly eradicated by the sheer force of the blow.  He was lifted easily off of the ground, the pistol knocked well clear of his grasp and into the snow.  Winters saw stars as he careened through the snow and darkness, finally impacting the ground in an uncontrolled roll that was stopped by another tree trunk, the twin impacts leaving his body aching and bruised.  He couldn‚Äôt help the pathetic, pained cry that left his mouth.\n\n‚ÄúIo‚Ä¶‚Äù He gasped, trying desperately to move his body.  ‚ÄúDamage‚Ä¶‚Äù  Though horrified and looking at him with a mixture of sorrow, fear, and awe, Io responded rapidly as her avatar flickered and flashed.\n\n‚ÄòNo major fractures, possible cracked ribs and internal bleeding, serious contusions likely if we survive.  Main processor hit, back plating cracked, computational power severely compromised‚Ä¶‚Äô  Io trailed off for a moment and she looked away from him.  ‚ÄòShutting down major functions to maintain ability to simulate and process battlefield solutions.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúNO!‚Äù  Winters let out a strangled cry as he rolled onto his stomach, hands sinking into the snow as he desperately tried to push himself upright through the pain that seemed to infuse his entire body.  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt‚Ä¶leave me!  Together‚Ä¶‚Äù he managed, using the tree as a crutch as he finally stood, finding his shield no longer on his back and his sword lying nearby.  He knelt down and clutched it in his grasp, sucking down air through the pain in his chest as he stood again on shaking legs.  Io had remained still; debating which course of action would put her operator in more danger, her programming at war with itself.  ‚ÄúI need you here.  Not my VI‚Ä¶you.‚Äù  Winters insisted as he stepped forward, a small amount of relief washing over him as Io refused to fade away.\n\n‚ÄòYes sir,‚Äô she whispered faintly, a profound and unintelligible look in her eyes.  \n\n‚ÄúWe promised we‚Äôd kill it together.  Now let‚Äôs fucking kill it!‚Äù  He growled, stalking forward unsteadily as the ursae tried to recover its own position.  Though it had effectively evened the fight with a single blow, Winters at least still had both eyes working and both of his legs.  The ursae couldn‚Äôt say that.  Its right paw remained cradled under its body, guarded by its left as it watched him and snapped his jaws whenever he moved.  As Winters continued his approach, seeing the handle of his knife jutting from one of the ursae‚Äôs eye sockets, the beast pushed itself upright as best it could, unwilling to surrender and unwilling to allow its prey free reign of the battlefield.  With a roar it lumbered at him, trying and failing to stay upright before careening over onto its right side, its leg failing to hold its massive weight.  In a flash Winters was there, his body screaming in protest as he opened up the bottom of the ursae‚Äôs mouth as far as his sword could.  Hot blood poured onto his glove and hand as the beast screamed and snapped, catching only air as Winters jumped back again.\n\n‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt even reach the roof of its mouth.  Damnit!‚Äù  He cursed, looking down at his now crimson blade.  The blood on his hand was rapidly turning cold, steaming in the frosty air.\n\n‚ÄòYour spear sir!‚Äô  Io cried.  ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs the longest weapon we possess!‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúCan you find my pistol?‚Äù  He asked instead, trying to get his bearings and figure out where he‚Äôd left his pack.  His head was still spinning, the trees around him refusing to stand straight.  He stumbled away from the ursae as its pained yowls continued, but he didn‚Äôt hear any signs that it was rising to attack again.  With Io making sure it didn‚Äôt get back up he finally reached his supplies and grabbed his spear, wondering if he had any chance of actually killing the thing.  One false step around its mouth and he was still dead.\n\n‚ÄòSir I‚Äôve tried but I can‚Äôt locate something that small in these conditions, not with my body compromised like this,‚Äô Io informed him sadly.  Winters shook his head.  \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault Io,‚Äù he said simply before turning to pace back towards the massive monster that had struggled partially upright yet again, this time keeping almost all of its weight on its left forepaw.  He shifted his course of attack as he did so, stepping one leg over another to move right and then left.  Even with one eye the ursae had no trouble tracking him with its head, content now to wait and possibly counter his attacks if he came close.  Though there was a lot of blood staining the snow beneath it the beast showed little sign of fatigue, the blood loss barely an issue given its size.  The ursae adopted a defensive position and stared him down, crouched and waiting, its fur on end and extended to increase its apparent size to maximum.  Winters blinked twice as a memory flashed to the fore of his mind, another time he‚Äôd been in significant pain in the middle of a fight against a large opponent.  ‚ÄúAre you ready?‚Äù  He asked.\n\n‚ÄòYes.‚Äô Io nodded and hefted her axe, marshalling her fears as she felt the smallest amount of peace come over Winters via his vitals.  He was confident they would win, and so she would be too.  ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs end this.‚Äô  With a nod, Winters bellowed with everything he had and charged straight at the ursae, his actions eliciting a mighty roar in reply.  He moved as fast as he could through the snow, watching the paws intently to see which would be the first to move.  As soon as he saw the wounded right paw lift from the ground he knew the approximate height he‚Äôd have to reach, leaping forward into a feet first dive that had him sink into the snow just under the wounded swipe of the massive, clawed paw.  The butt of the spear was thin enough to sink into the snow and reach the ground, providing an anchor point from which Winters could reach his feet easily again by pushing against his weapon.  As he stood he found himself directly under the beast‚Äôs maw.  Before the paw could swipe back Winters tightened his grip and thrust up with all that he had, feeling the metal point of the weapon slip easily through the wound he‚Äôd made with his sword and up into the unprotected roof of the ursae‚Äôs mouth.  He cried out like an animal as he pushed harder, feeling another thick membrane give way.  With his palm on the butt of the weapon Winters gave one final push, sinking the entire length of his spear back and up into the ursae‚Äôs skull cavity, his gauntleted arm finding itself swallowed completely by the ursae‚Äôs mouth.  Instead of a roar a bloody gurgle met his ears as Io began waving frantically at him.\n\n‚ÄòSir!  Multi-ton death monster about to fall on us!‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúMoving!‚Äù  He yelled, insisting his legs act one final time before completely giving out on him as he turned and leaped for safety, the body of the ursae collapsing onto its crippled side and slamming into the ground.  ‚ÄúIo, status!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not‚Ä¶moving?  It‚Äôs not moving.  We did it‚Ä¶sir, we did it!‚Äô  Io declared triumphantly, jumping into the air and throwing her projection at him as if to hug him.  Her utter enthusiasm was enough to get him off the ground in spite of the lactic acid burning through his muscles.  Everything hurt, his body bruised and battered from the colossal hit he‚Äôd taken, but he was still alive.  He turned to face what he‚Äôd wrought.  Before him lay a towering mass of fur, flesh, and bone.  A thin drip of blood could be seen running from between the thing‚Äôs jaws as its head lolled to the side, its final eye dark, lifeless, and unmoving.  Winters couldn‚Äôt help himself in that moment, abandoning any sort of identity as a member of a proud, interstellar race of beings to simply throw his arms back and yell to the sky.  \n\n‚ÄúAAAAAAAAHHHHHH‚Ä¶RRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!‚Äù  Io presently joined him between heaving breaths, finding the Aegis‚Äô speakers still functional and activating them.  For a minute the two of them yelled themselves hoarse, bathing themselves in the primal satisfaction of a victorious hunt against all odds, of killing something no one had killed in generations.  Their battlecry echoed far and wide through the trees and the snow, a challenge to anything else on that planet that would dare defy them.  When Winters finally slumped forward, body and voice exhausted, he looked at Io.\n\n‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòWha- wha- wha- what?!‚Äô  Io spluttered as she flailed about and fell on her backside, earning a scratchy laugh from her partner.\n\n‚ÄúI may not know German Io, but that much was obvious.  You still mean it now that your life isn‚Äôt in direct peril?‚Äù  He asked in a raspy voice before winking at her.\n\n‚ÄòYou make this utterly impossible, du barbar.  But yes‚Ä¶I do still love you.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúIs that alright?‚Äù  Winters inquired uncertainly.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòI do not mean like that, sir.  I mean it in the way that a machine loves her human.‚Äô  Winters felt his arms go limp at his sides, turning his head for emphasis as he looked at her.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what way is that?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòIf you don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt worry about it.  How about we, you know, send up the flare?!‚Äô  She suggested impatiently, cheeks flushed red with embarrassment, happiness, and relief to still be among the living.  For a few minutes the two of them surveyed the area, collecting the scattered pieces of Winters‚Äô gear.  Without a massive creature trying to kill them the process went by smoothly, except for the spear which remained very much lodged inside their kill.  Even the pistol was eventually retrieved from a nearby snow drift.\n\n‚ÄúIo, I don‚Äôt mean to cause a crisis again,‚Äù Winters began as he dug through his survival pack and withdrew the red flare gun.  ‚ÄúBut won‚Äôt this thing get obscured in the clouds?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòPartially, yes.  One calculation shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult though sir, a second please,‚Äô Io requested as she sat down at a desk and began scribbling away.  She‚Äôd changed again, looking prim, proper, and definitely not as though she‚Äôd just fought for her life against an ursae.  Leaving her to it, Winters drew his sword and approached his kill, finally taking the time to truly appreciate the size of the beast he‚Äôd just slain.  His only regret was that they‚Äôd never get a real reading on the thing‚Äôs weight.  Given all he‚Äôd been through since being stranded on the planet he figured that, at least, would be a fun little statistic to bring back with him if he ever got a ride off-world.\n\n‚ÄúSo Io, what got damaged in the fight?‚Äù  He asked worriedly, thrusting hard into the underside of the beast‚Äôs neck with his sword and cutting a gap from which he hoped to drain much of the blood from the animal so as to preserve as much meat as possible.  Unlike the skin around the mandibles the rest of the hide was very thick and required most of his full strength to slice through.  Io looked up from her work.  \n\n‚ÄòMy main processor was crushed sir‚Ä¶‚Äô Io trailed off and developed a faraway look in her eyes.  ‚ÄòWere it not for your unorthodox choices of equipment I would have never been born.  And now, without them, I would have died.‚Äô  He glanced over at her and smiled sadly.\n\n‚ÄúAnd I was the only one to make it off the Lancer.  We did it Jess‚Ä¶I hope you got to see that,‚Äù he finished, eyes becoming unfocused and glossy.\n\n‚ÄòWe are lucky people, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äô  Io asked softly.\n\n‚ÄúWe are, Io.  All the more reason to keep living.  You have that solution?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòYes sir, the following is the minimum height the flare will need to achieve in order to be seen from Veera‚Äôs village given my best approximation of our distance from it as the crow flies.  It should be just below the current cloud cover, give or take a few dozen feet.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúGreat.  Thanks Io.‚Äù  Winters wiped his blade in the snow, satisfied with his work.  A steadily growing, dark red cavity in the white powder marked where the ursae‚Äôs lifeblood was leaving its neck.  Returning his blade to his back Winters set the dial on his flare gun, pointed it to the sky between the branches of the trees, and fired.  A thin trail of smoke was left behind in the wake of the flare before a blindingly bright light lit the snowy skies above.  Io had to dim his HUD to compensate.  When Winters looked back down he noticed she‚Äôd added a small piece back to her display now that the combat and hunt had ended.  Winters‚Äô heart beat hard as he remembered his broken promise, thankful beyond words that he would be given his chance to make it up to the Cauthan he loved.  *-2 days to Christmas.*  \n\n‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late but‚Ä¶‚Äù he reached up to touch the space above his mauled chest plate, feeling his fingers run through deep ridges that had saved his life to finally clasp around the small bands of metal.  They‚Äôd survived.  ‚ÄúMerry Christmas Veera.‚Äù\n\n\\-----\n\n[Previous] [p] | [First] [f] | [Next] [n] | [Wiki] [w] | [Support Me] [y] | [Merchandise] [t]\n\n-----\n\nOwn The HEL Jumper in the Format of your Choice: [hardcover] (http://www.lulu.com/shop/sabatonbabylon/the-hel-jumper-survive/hardcover/product-23914997.html) | [paperback] (http://www.lulu.com/shop/sabatonbabylon/the-hel-jumper-survive/paperback/product-23916511.html) | [epub] (http://www.lulu.com/shop/sabatonbabylon/the-hel-jumper-survive/ebook/product-23909951.html) | [Amazon Kindle] (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M5HJ4YP?pf_rd_p=c2945051-950f-485c-b4df-15aac5223b10&pf_rd_r=1QRG8X6MYTE9EZP9BYC7)",

    "body": "**A work by an unknown author, previously linked on this sub 2 years ago. Angron is imprisoned in the Palace of Terra before the Heresy, during the Siege he is released for one final battle similar to the Death Company.**\n\n\"Lord Dorn is going to invent new means of torture and execution just so he can use them on us.\" Skane rasps in his augmetic voice, the grenades and vials on his bandolier clinking against his black Destroyer armor as the mismatched band of World Eaters makes their way through the bowels of the Imperial Palace.\n\n\"Tell you what.\" Kargos answers, the Apocethary's smile evident in his voice over the vox. \"If we're all still alive tomorrow, I'll be happy to help him come up with something suitably horrible. How about that?\"\n\n\"Both of you, enough.\" Kharn snaps. \"We've all seen the feeds. Eternity Gate will fall in minutes unless we take appropriate measures.\"\n\n\"What a wonderfully circumspect way of putting it.\" This from Vorias, as he leads the last eight of members of the Twelfth Legion's Librarius at a measured distance from the rest of them. \"You could also say, unless we defy the express orders of the Emperor's anointed representative and undertake a course of action likely to end with all of us dead. He was locked away for a REASON, Kharn. You saw what happened, we all did! He killed more of our Legion in the Petitioner's Quarter than the damned traitors did! The Nails...Angron's mind is gone, and...\"\n\n\"He is our father.\" the Eighth Captain answers wearily, the sounds of distant battle and the presence of so many psykers causing his own Nails to snap and snarl inside his skull. \"It isn't right that he dies like this, like a rat in a trap. You know it as well as I do, or you wouldn't have come with us. So spare me the caterwauling.\"\n\n\"Die on the walls or die down here with you fools.\" Vorias mutters softly. \"Does it really matter which end we choose?\"\n\nNormally, the cell block they are entering would be heavily guarded by the Custodes themselves, but stands empty now, the Imperial tactical staff having thrown everything they can into the desperate struggle on the Palace walls. The only living thing in this wing is the prisoner forced into the most heavily secured cell in the opening days of the Siege, when it became obvious he was completely out of control. Opening the cell door usually requires a complex array of gene coded verification markers and electronic clearance signifiers, but Kharn makes do with a plasma pistol, his power armor groaning in protest as he pries at the armored door while the glowing metal that was once a lock dribbles down onto the stone floor.\n\n\"Angron? Sire? We...\"\n\nIt is on him before he can get the door all the way open, before he can speak another word, a gibbering, slavering thing that bears him to the ground with a predator's leap, tearing away chunks of war plate and Astartes meat and bone with equal ease as it sobs and laughs to itself.\n\n**DO NOT DRAW YOUR WEAPONS.**\n\nThe thundering chorus of the Communion, the union of the remaining Twelfth Legion psykers into a single gesalt being, booms in the minds of the remaining World Eaters as hands instinctively shoot towards the butts of pistols and the hilts of blades in reaction to Kharn's hideous demise. Their Nails howl in protest, biting back against the violation with wild red hate, but the entity will not be denied. They remain frozen as unseen energies wrap themselves around the creature that continues to rip apart Kharn's corpse, killing him five, ten times over.\n\nWhatever the united will of the coven is doing, it is clearly not without cost. One by one, the slumping forms of the psychic World Eaters succumb to a variety of agonizing demises, helms splitting open to reveal cracked skulls and boiling brain matter, red flames igniting from nowhere to devour ceramite and flesh with equal hunger. When Angron finally rises from his feral crouch, the only one left alive is Vorias himself, although not for long if the blood streaming from his helm's seals and the gurgling sounds he is making into the vox are any indication.\n\n\"Brothers! Sisters!\" Angron's eyes are glazed, unfocused, and he seems completely oblivious to the gore splattered all over him. \"I can hear the thunder...the high riders! They come for us at last! It all ends today, eh?\"\n\nKargos realizes, then, just what the coven has done, what bait they found to draw the Eater of Worlds out of his Butcher's Nail induced madness, playing on the one thing Angron desires more than any other. In his mind, Angron isn't fighting his treacherous brothers at Terra...he's standing with his gladiator army in the mountains of De'Shea, watching the assembled armies of the world draw near to crush his doomed rebellion. It takes all the Apocethary's self control not to rip his helmet off and spit on Vorias's corpse, but what does it matter now? At least this way his father can achieve something useful with his death.\n\n\"Yes, the high riders.\" Kargos mutters, when it becomes clear none of the others intend to take the initiative in speaking to their insane Primarch. \"You'll need your armor and weapons first, sire.\" Angron's playful cuff lands on his shoulder plates like the impace of a power fist as the maimed giant laughs at him.\n\n\"Sire? Sire? 'Sire', indeed. Am I a paperskin now, that you should speak to me so? HA! You'll be making them laugh when they finally cut your head off, won't you, Asti?\"\n\nLhorke, the first Lord of the Legio XII War Hounds, is the last living defender of Eternity Gate, even though his current condition stretches the definition a bit. The Dreadnaught has killed with his combi bolters until they ran dry of ammo, killed with his lightning claws until a lucky melta blast severed the neural connectors that let him maneuver his deadly ironform, and even then he continued to snarl curses at the attackers, damning them in Low Gothic and Nagrakali until one of the whoreson Sons of Horus shattered his speakers with a spiteful hail of bolter fire.\n\nNow he can only watch as the last of the defenders falls under before the press of traitor bodies, as Legionaries in the eye searing purple of the Emperor's Children and the sea green of the bastard Warmaster's own charge past his prone position in disorganized packs. What a glorious end for the Twelfth, herded into a breach in the walls like fodder to buy time for more reliable warriors to organize a true defense elsewhere.\n\nHe doesn't blame Rogal Dorn for using them so. He blames ANGRON, for ruining the host he once led, turning disciplined phalanxes into screaming mobs who hurled themselves out of their fortifications at every opportunity, throwing their lives away before the superior numbers of the traitors in useless, worthless counter attacks. True sons of their pathetic father, every one of them, blood mad berserkers heeding nothing except the implants mutilating their minds.\n\nEven though he can't move or speak, Lhorke can still \"see\" and \"hear\" inside his amniotic coffin, enough of the audiovisual links between his machine shell and his decrepit corpse remaining intact to provide him with a wonderful view of Eternity Gate's last moments. It has been well and truly breached this time, and the howled Nagrakali battle cries and gunning chainblades he hears approaching will not do a damn thing to change these simple facts. He has no idea what the defenders are thinking throwing a few more World Eaters into this disaster, unless Dorn is simply taking the opportunity to purge a little more unreliable chaff from his ranks.\n\nThe Dreadnaught is forced to revise his initial assessment when the first of the Traitor vanguard are hurled back past his position. This is not mere hyperbole...bodies and pieces of bodies in the armor of the III and XVI Legion are literally thrown through the air to rain down around his paralyzed machine body. Lhorke is the only surviving Imperial to bear witness to what follows, and he will only speak of it once, when the Praetorian himself kneels before his sarcophagas and softly whispers \"How did my brother die?\" Even then, he will recount his story with a barely disguised contempt. \"My brother\" indeed. Such a change from \"the beast\" and \"that lunatic\" that Dorn spat around the strategia table when Horus's fleet first broke out of the Warp. Truly, nothing improves a reputation like dying.\n\nLhorke has seen his gene father fight many times before, and even he will admit that for all his MANY faults on the battlefield Angron is an unrivaled force of destruction. But he has never seen him fight like this. The Twelfth Primarch is transfigured, leading his white armored sons through the Traitor ranks with no concern for the numbers arrayed against him, the bolt rounds biting into his flesh, or anything else. How do you fight something like that? How do you battle a thunderstorm, an earthquake, a wildfire? You don't. You get out of its way, or you die.\n\nThe traitors are certainly managing the latter well enough, Astartes in the livery of Perturabo, Lorgar, and Alpharius joining in the fight only to be mowed down as easily as the rest. More and more enemies pour through the shattered gate, dropping out of the sky on jetpacks, setting up heavy weapons behind their dying brethren, Word Bearers calling up nightmare beasts of unreality and directing them towards the raging Primarch. It suddenly seems to the old War Hound that he is watching two battles. He is never certain, to his dying day, whether this is some trick of shared blood that flows even in his corpse's veins, or a merely a mechanical malfunction caused by the injuries his iron coffin has sustained, but he sees what he sees nonetheless.\n\nIn one battle, Angron and an ever shrinking pack of World Eaters reap a jaw dropping harvest of life from other Legionaries, and in the other....in the other Angron fights beside the emaciated, filthy forms of mortals, clad in rags. The stone beneath his feet is not the marble floor of the palace, but the uneven grey of a mountain ridge, covered in white snow. His enemies are armored not in burnished iron or blood red, but gold, polished so bright it hurts the eyes to look at them directly. He is laughing as they shoot and stab and burn him, laughing as the figures fighting at his side fall one by one.\n\n*\"COME ON! COME ON, THEN! COME SEE ME FIGHT ONE LAST TIME, YOU SONS OF DOGS! I DEFY YOU! WE ALL DEFY YOU! WE WILL WEAR YOUR CHAINS NO MORE! COME AND DIE, YOU GUTLESS BASTARDS!\"*\n\nHe is fighting alone now, still fighting, blood of the Emperor, how he fights. Lhorke has not thought there was anything left in the universe that could still freeze his blood with awe, but he was wrong. It should be impossible for any one warrior to stand against so many, even a Primarch. It is a simple truth, grounded in basic arithmetic. Angron meets that truth and defies it, denies it with his own, even simpler truth. He will not surrender. He will NOT be conquered. He will *NOT* lay down his life. The high riders, the paper skins, the sneering, arrogant slavers of De'Shea...they're going to have to take it.\n\nThe end is sudden when it comes. One minute, the Warmaster's followers are still throwing themselves at the mad Primarch to die beneath his blades. The next they are falling back, Emperor's Children fleeing in a mad sprint, Iron Warriors quickstepping backwards in good order, bolters still barking defiantly in spite of their cowardice. Angron ROARS after them, throwing his head back and lifting his axes to the sky, then allows his head to slump forward, chin leaning on his armored chest in repose.\n\nHe is still in that same position, still standing, dead muscles locked in place by rigor mortis and lactic acid, when warriors in the battered and grimy yellow of Dorn's Legion reverently remove Gorefather and Gorechild from his corpse's hands.\n\nIt is later, much later. So much has been lost, and so many have died, but a select few have been judged worthy of commemoration in stone and metal, a measure of immortality to inspire all who gaze at them. Ostian Delacour is one of those judged worthy of this vital task, charged by Dorn himself with memorializing the Twelfth Primarch at the site of his final battle at eternity gate. He studies his sketches, prepared with the aid of the VII Primarch, thoughtfully. A beatific form, gazing benevolently down at all who pass through the Gate, its features wracked with just the hint of a martyr's pain.\n\nThe reverberating thud of metal on marble makes him look up, to the the towering Contemptor Dreadnaught in bronze and pale blue stomping down the entranceway towards him.\n\n\"You're the sculptor, then?\" it asks.\n\n\"Ye-yes?\" he ventures after a moment, his voice momentarily stolen by the fear evoked by the enormous war machine's towering presence.\n\n\"And that, that is the....no.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No. No, no, and no. I've kept silent while idiots turn that lunatic into a thricebedamned saint, but this...no. No. He ruined the Twelfth, butchered more innocents that I can count, but the son of a whore held Eternity Gate all by himself. That counts for something. I owe him that much, you understand?\"\n\n\"You...you do not care for the statue?\"\n\n\"You won't be carving it. At least, not that monstrosity. You'll shape it like I tell you to shape it, you understand?\"\n\n\"But...but Lord Dorn...\"\n\n\"Is not standing here, ready to blow you off these walls and take his chances that the next artist they send will be more amendable to reason.\" The Dreadnaught finishes, its internal mechanisms loudly cycling more ammo into the enormous guns mounted on its arms.\n\n\"I..I...what changes would you like made, my lord?\"\n\nThroughout the Imperium, there are many wonderful works of art created in remembrance of Angron, the Red Angel of Nuceria, who laid down his life at the Siege of Terra. Paintings of his noble countenance can be found in almost every Ecclesiarchy structure of note, and his regal, knightly image is a popular subject for friezes and murals depicting great military triumphs.\n\nBut the most well known one (if not the most popular) is at Terra herself, viewable only by those with the wealth or influence to journey to the throneworld. Cast in jagged granite, this statue has none of the grandeur or divine beauty most other representations of the Twelfth Primarch seek to capture...it is a ragged, ruined thing, face twisted by wounds new and old and by a fury that seems more akin to that the more lurid brand of noveau artists portray upon the daemons of the Warp than one of the heroic sons of the Emperor. It is said that to meet that raging gaze, sightless stone though it is, has caused strong men, powerful men, Lord Militant Generals and Warmasters to tremble. A few simple words are inscribed on the plinth it stands atop, the only accolades a cantankerous dreadnaught would allow.\n\n**ANGRON OF DE'SHELIKA RIDGE**  \n**HE DIED FREE‚Äã**",

    "body": "‚Ä¢ The Emperor has vestiges of humanity left within him that even Valdor and Malcador are concerned by, and it's confirmed that He personally refers to the primarchs as \"his sons.\" What's odd though is Valdor comments on this as if he knows the Emperor is either becoming, or is, something more than human at this point, and says \"Then his human sentiments... are still ebbing?\" when Malcador tells him. \n\n‚Ä¢ Believing the Palace to be essentially unguarded and thinking shes amassed a force large enough to deal with the limited number of custodians within the Palace,  One of the High Lords named Kandawire leads a rebellion, with the Thunder Warriors and their \"primarch\" Ushotan, against the Imperium to try and bring Valdor and the custodians down, so that they may answer for their slaughtering of the Thunder Warriors. Which... does NOT go well for them. \n\n‚Ä¢ It's all but confirmed the Custodians wiped out the Thunder Warriors due to the inability to control their genetic, mental and physiological degradation. Valdor comments on this during his interview with the High Lord, saying that they were prone to simply stop following orders, die on the spot due to organ failure, descend into unstable psychological states that made them similar to the very warlords they were fighting. Valdor also states, in his eyes, the Thunder Warriors had grown to become \"an empire within an empire.\" \n\n‚Ä¢ Valdor and Malcador are aware of Chaos in a very broad sense. I'm not sure if the rest of the Custodians are. \n\n‚Ä¢ the gene matriarch, \"Astarte\" is working desperately to solve the continued issue of genetic and mental instability within the genebred forces of the Imperium, but her laboratory on Terra is destroyed, destroying most of her research. This leads her into a state of mind that the new \"Legions\" are a hopeless endeavor that will eventually descend into similar psychological and genetic instability similar to the Thunder Warriors. So, under the cover of the High Lords rebellion (more on that later) and despite Valdor knowing she's likely about to betray the Imperium, she blows up the entirety of the Terran gene labs within the palace. None of this matters. Valdor (and only Valdor amongst the Custodians), Malcador and the Emperor knew she was a traitor, and secretly made copies of all her research and flew it to Luna, where the gene repositories are stated to be able to \"make thousands into hundreds of thousands.\"\n\n‚Ä¢ The reason that Valdor didn't alert the other custodians (who actively try and stop Astarte from blowing up the labs) is because they *needed* these labs destroyed in order to make room within the dungeon for the initial Webway project, which is such a secret only the \"triumvirate\" of Valdor, and Malcador are aware of. \n\n‚Ä¢ The Primarchs were already in the process of creation near the end of the Unity War, and both Valdor and Malcador think they're dead. Near the end it is discovered that the Emperor has \"felt\" their presence within the ether, possibly due to their coming of age. This causes extreme concern amongst Valdor, as it is his view that, if they're still alive they too will be tainted by the \"enemy\" and will eventually have similar issues that the Thunder Warrior had (and by proxy, so will their gene sons)!Valdor thinks they should be destroyed if they're in fact still alive. \n\n‚Ä¢ The First Legion makes an appearance, and it's noted that while the Thunder Warriors are more so \"warlords\" the First are near-machine-like killers, whose unit cohesion makes them exponentially more deadly. It's the First Legion that stands behind Valdor when the High Lords army reached the Imperial Palace, and they absolutely murderfuck everyone. However, it's stated that these are *fresh* brand new soldiers, who are still bleeding from their gene surgeries and still a bit \"slow\" due to their aggressive psycho conditioning. It's also made clear that while the Ushotan can easily kill the soldiers of the first, they almost *always* get a hit on him before they die. Something normal Thunder Warriors would never be able to do. They're also stated to be slightly shorter and less stocky than their predecessor, but learn like Terminators in combat, learning from and identifying weaknesses, tactics and strategy insanely fast . \n\n‚Ä¢ Valdor is an absolute fucking machine. He literally throws a tank, a cage with over a dozen soldiers *inside of it* and slaughters not only Thunder Warrior veterans, but their primarch Ushotan with ease. It's to the point that Valdor, mid-melee can see minute drops in speed due to lactic acid build up and can move fast enough that Thunder Warriors can't register his movements or parries. Ushotan thinks Valdor is doing a counter, moves to strike and *mid-strike* Valdor changes strike paths and inpales Ushotan with the Apollonian spear. He also has a very odd connection to the Emperor. So much so that one of the reasons he wants the Primarchs destroyed is that he seriously doubts they could ever serve both the Emperor, or believe in the Emperor's dream as much as he does, and states \"...this is all I have.\" \n\n‚Ä¢ The Emperor also has a weird relationship with Valdor, and while it's never explained in depth and just kinda brushed over, it's stated the Emperor moved whole armies and expended insane amounts of resources to get to Valdor. \n\n‚Ä¢ Valdor, when Malcador tells him the Chaos gods like \"games\" begins to think to himself that there is a lesson in this... He visits one of the wounded custodians who were blown up trying to stop Astarte, and basically says real-world threats serve a purpose, and this is how the original Blood Games come to be. \n\n‚Ä¢ The ending line is Valdor saying the following: \"The Imperium is born. The Palace is secure. All it needs now... is a Throne.\"",

So, under the cover of the High Lords rebellion (more on that later) and despite Valdor knowing she's likely about to betray the Imperium, she blows up the entirety of the Terran gene labs within the palace. None of this matters. Valdor (and only Valdor amongst the Custodians), Malcador and the Emperor knew she was a traitor, and secretly made copies of all her research and flew it to Luna, where the gene repositories are stated to be able to \"make thousands into hundreds of thousands.\"\n\nAstarte‚Äôs work wasn‚Äôt totally lost, and that‚Äôs not why she thought they would fail. It was the Primarchs being taken that caused that. Without their baseline data it was incredibly hard to produce stable geneseed, but they already had tons of it. \n\nThat‚Äôs what Valdor rescued that night. He ran in and out of the burning lab saving geneseed. Enough geneseed survived for the Legions to be founded regardless of the losses that night. \n\nThe move to utilize the Selenar didn‚Äôt happen then either. It wasn‚Äôt until after the Battle of Luna that the Emperor sent them the info to ramp up production.",

Regardless of level of training this is incompetence and a possible systems failure.\n\nMy first question is why did the PA at your presumed teaching hospital pick up a hypotensive patient over any of the ed residents/attendings?  That doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me.  In all EDs  I‚Äôve worked  in (9 to be exact) an attending or senior resident would be notified about this pt (by assigned RN or charge) and be at bedside within minutes of this patient getting roomed.  If by some crazy circumstance a midlevel or off service resident picked up this patient, the attending would be  notified and heavily involved with the management.\n\nOther points of failure\n- 2SIRS criteria (tachypnia, leukopenia), WITHOUT HYPOTENSION - as soon as that cbc resulted indicating leukopenia, should have triggered  full sepsis workup including bcx and lactate. Should have triggered a  sepsis flag if it wasn‚Äôt immediately obvious anyways.\n\n- add on + source + hypotension and this meets criteria for severe sepsis, teetering towards septic shock (defined by hypotension not responsive to adequate fluid resuscitation), with immediate abx and fluids needing to be ordered\n\n- I‚Äôm sure the ed director would love to hear that the PA didnt have time because ‚Äúmy shift was over‚Äù.  Thats BS\n\n- We dont renally dose abx in ED, as it is usually a first time dose.  I‚Äôve never worked anywhere that has done this, actually.\n\nNot ranting about PAs. I‚Äôve never worked with ANY PRROVIDER that would be this negligent.  As  such I‚Äôm getting vibes this isn‚Äôt the whole story.

Doxy alone cleared up the back but not the chest.  These rashes happened when I was a bit older due to an automimmune issue.\n\nI used to have mild to moderate facial acne in my 20s and early 30s, but it goes away when you get older. But my eventual winning routine was benzoyl wash, followed by neutrogena toner (no alcohol!) and neutrogena mosturizer.  If I had a zit that had to be popped, I immediately spot treated it with tea tree oil.  None of this made any difference on my chest and back acne other than the tea tree oil, but otherwise I had to get the aforementioned scripts.",

A few days ago his fur brother, a 12 year old Alaskan Husky named Lafy, was put down due to severe neurological issues leading to heart failure amd extreme build up of lactic acid. He's been an absolute wreck since my wife came home without Lafy (for context, I'm currently deployed). He hasn't been eating, he's been isolating himself and occasionally howling which he's never done before. He hasn't been barking at anything, and his appetite is next to nothing. My wife has tried giving him attention and love but he's scooted himself away every time.\n\nMy wife just called me saying he seems like he's having seizures and she's now taking him to the vet. I only hope he makes it through this. I feel so powerless. I'm only a few weeks from being home amd I don't know what I'm going to do if both of my boys are gone before I come back. I want nothing more than to be able to tell Flop it's not his fault if he's somehow blaming himself. But I'm at the point where I'm just trying to prepare myself for the worst.\n\nIn addition to his grieving, before Lafy was put down both dogs had gotten out of their fenced in part of the house and killed my wife's tortoise. I'm wondering if the bacteria from that could be causing issues too, but I know based on what my wife has said, Flop's been extremely depressed. Just another factor to consider I guess. I'm just praying he makes it.",

        "body": "Another update. The vet believes he consumed coolant. Based on how Lafy (his brother) passed and how quickly Flop's condition deteriorated, the vet believes it was an intentional poisoning. We could ask them to conduct a necropsy to find out for sure, but my boy has been through enough and while he is going to be cremated, I dont wan't to think about anyone doing that to him. So instead, I'd like to remember him for the great companion he was.\n\nWe found Flop at a local pet store. I remember the day we took him home. He was scared of the car, but my wife held him and did everything she could to keep him calm. He was a very curious pup and extremely playful. When he met Lafy, he walked right up to him to check him out, trying to see if he could play with him. Lafy let him jump around him a bit, but Lafy quickly laid the groundwork to let Flop know he was in charge. He was never mean, but he did set his boundaries.\n\nSlowly, their bond began to grow as Flop got more mature. Flop still annoyed, Lafy quite a bit, but they soon became inseparable. When I was taking time to train Flop individually, Lafy would whine, wanting to be with him. And when I would return the favor to Lafy to give him personal time, Flop would whine. Eventually, my wife and I worked out a way to take both dogs out at the same time to work with them while giving them access to each other.\n\nFlop quickly grew into his natural disposition of being a guardian, especially when my wife became pregnant with our son. He defended us from all perceived threats, real and imaginary. But when it came to us and our son, he was as gentle as could be, with more patience than I have ever seen an animal have. The trend continued when our daughter was born.\n\nHe was the best dog I have ever owned, bar none. Flop made me a pyrenees lover with every bark, snuggle, growl, jump, and sniff. We had him for 3 years, and I can safely say they were the best 3 years I've had for a number of reasons, and he was absolutely amongst the top of those reasons. I only wish I could have been there in his final moments, and I wish I could have prevented what happened to both him and Lafy.\n\nThank you all for the support, it means a lot to me. I have no real outlets where I am, and I still have a while before I'll be home. Much love.",

I took the auto smooth filter off and last pic is no makeup just after washing my face.\n\nMy melasma started suddenly in late 2019/early 2020 for no apparent reason. Started in between my eyebrows then migrated up my forehead until it hit a peak in 2021/2022 where my dad actually thought I had dirt on my face one time. \n\nThe only consistent thing I've done since 2021 was to add daily SPF. I use La Roche Posay cream and liquid (I use either one or the other depending on my mood) tinted SPF 50 and this has replaced my use of foundation. I keep it handy and reapply. I also try to use hats when I can. And I'm not perfect about it, I just am consisten mostof the time.\n\nI live in Canada, but sailed my boat down to Mexico last year, and lived on the boat in Mexico for half a year. So I was definitely outdoors in hot/sunny weather which I was super apprehensive about but I seem to have kept it under some kind of control. \n\nI have used a varying combination of the following, but I've been on and off off these over the time. I'm very un-perfect, but I do what I can when I can.\n\n- retinol 0.025% prescription. I use for a month-ish then a couple months off.\n- L. Ascorbic acid (the ordinary) powder mixed into a few drops of water and rubbed in in the morning. I love this.\n- hyaularonic acid (the ordinary) when I'm extra dry. I won't wear this in the morning if I'm going out in the sun. Not really sure why, I just  have a 'gut feeling' about this with nothing to back it up. But there you go. \n- alpha arbutin (the ordinary) I used for a while, not sure if it helped? \n- ZO skin hydroquinone 2%. I had 2 bottles: one I used in 2022 and then I was off of it for 2023 then 2024 I started again. I think this helped but man it's really hard to tell.\n- cleanser, I use whatever. Dove bar soap sometimes. I try to use pure witch hazel as a toner but havent always had it.\n- salicylic acid and lactic acid i like in the evenings once in a while\n- Skin ceuticals face scrub. I LOVE this and won't use it every day, but when I do it always just resets/refreshes like no other product I've found\n\nHonestly nothing sticks out as a holy grail except maybe the SPF. This is entirely anecdotal, but I think changing up my skincare and taking breaks from things has worked in a way because it prevents my skin from getting used to any one product. So being imperfect, but attentive, and following a gut feeling about products, maybe has helped. It's a lot of work, reading about everything, and finding a way to use them that feels right for my skin, but I'm SO happy that its paying off. I don't even see it much in the mirror anymore and I'm so happy.",

High fever, uncontrollable shaking for hours, dangerously high lactic acid and white blood cell count, and vomiting eight times were. In spite of the fact that this was a medical emergency for the mother, it took 22 hours to get the doomed fetus out of her because of delays in care due to Texas anti-abortion law. Her cervix is basically broken, in non-medical terms (still dilated four weeks after her abortion after FOUR back-to-back rounds of induction medication) and, because doctors took an extra legal precaution and only offered her the inferior method of abortion for her case (labor induction, which they needed to dose her four times for for it to even work- clearly her body didn‚Äôt want to or wasn‚Äôt able to push out a fetus when it was that sick and had that badly compromised muscle performance and blood flow- instead of the much more effective dilation and evacuation), her abortion was partially unsuccessful and she has undergone two more procedures over weeks to fully remove the infected placenta and stop her from bleeding.\n\nThe gruesome details matter. This will happen to women in NC who are forced to demonstrate in multiple ways they are dying to get abortions under SB 20.\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòI was crying, asking for help. And I remember them literally not saying anything. [The doctors and nurses] would just literally look at me and look at Stephen and they're just blank.

I always had the occasional pimple in high school but within my first week of moving to college, my face broke out horribly for the next few years until gradually tapering off. My dad would always asked if I washed my face or to stop using skincare because it was damaging to my skin. I would always hear him asking my mom behind my back why I was breaking out so bad when neither of them had acne growing up. I remember going on vacation with my boyfriend one time and we were cuddling before he looked at me and said \"Man, why do you think your acne is so bad?\" I was having such a good time and that destroyed all the confidence I had to the point where I had to go to the bathroom to cry üôÉ. There was another time that a kid at my workplace asked why I had so much \"stuff\" on my face before their older sibling told them that was rude. Honestly, I wouldn't think about my acne much while out in public but it was when people would bring it up in conversation that I became very self conscious. I noticed that when my skin was bad, it seemed to offend people? Idk, their tone about it was always so rude and accusatory like I somehow wronged them by having a problem that exclusively affected me.",

So, how do we create an alternative where we avoid the high fat content, while still achieving the right consistency? This is where we need to think innovatively.\"\n>\n>Risbo and his colleagues only used four ingredients in their experiments: water, edible lactic acid bacteria, a little bit of milk protein, and a thickening agent. There are many kinds of lactic acid bacteria‚Äîthe kind used by the food industry as a yogurt culture and to preserve cold cuts‚Äîand they are plentiful in nature, found in plants and in human/animal mucus membranes and digestive tracts. They also turn out to be ideal building blocks for foods and are roughly the same size as the fat globules in heavy whipping cream.\n>\n>The Danish team made both soft and stiffer versions of their prototype whipped cream using two different varieties of bacteria: Lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. lactis¬†(LBD) and Lactobacillus crispatus (LBC). The LBC strain is more hydrophobic, producing a cream that is stiffer and retains liquid better than the concoction produced with LBD, which is hydrophilic.\n>\n>These experiments were primarily to demonstrate proof of concept, and the resulting foams were evaluated primarily for texture and desirable foamy characteristics‚Äînot for taste. So we're not likely to see canisters of \"Lacti-Wip\" on store shelves any time soon. But the experiments provided valuable insight into how best to create a non-dairy whipped cream alternative with a similar food structure.\n\nIt's promising to hear about these initial results with this topic of research, and it will be interesting to see what results from this in the future.",

    "body": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share something from my personal experience that has made a huge difference in my tretinoin journey. For me, the key to success with tretinoin is regularly shedding dead skin.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I do: After washing my face, I gently rub my skin with my hands. This helps remove the dead skin, which clumps up into these noticeable bits‚Äîlike many clumps. I do this about 3-4 times a week, and every time I‚Äôm amazed at how much dead skin comes off.\n\nNow, think about it: If I didn‚Äôt remove all that buildup, it would probably clog my pores and sabotage my progress. No wonder some people struggle with tretinoin‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to imagine how even missing one day of shedding could lead to clogged pores!\n\nImportant: I‚Äôm talking about physical exfoliation here. Yes, chemical exfoliants like glycolic acid or lactic acid can help too, but in my experience, nothing beats gently rubbing away the dead skin with your hands or using a microfiber cloth.\n\nOf course, be gentle‚Äîdon‚Äôt scrub or irritate your skin! But trust me, if you could see the amount of clumped-up dead skin that comes off, you‚Äôd understand why this step is so important.\n\nAnyone else do this? Or have other tips for managing tretinoin? Would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nNeed proof that i works on me? Check my post!",

    "body": "Thought I would throw this out there.\n\nEven in calisthenics, which was conceived as a bodyweight sport, there seems to be a huge bias towards hypertrophy and strength - 90% of people who get to 10-15 pull-ups almost always exclusively just start adding weight and  as they get stronger keep adding more and more weight rather than increasing reps, and don‚Äôt push beyond the 8 or so rep range. I understand that some people prioritise mass gain and raw strength etc however I think many are missing out on many advantages exclusive to training higher rep sets with just their own bodyweight. \n\nIf you want to get into sports like climbing, gymnastics, or ninja warrior, muscular endurance is much more important as those sports are just a case of holding on as long as possible to the bar or wall etc. Training endurance helps your body adapt to things like lactic acid management and also can improve things like dead hangs and grip etc. (lower rep heavier sets don‚Äôt improve grip as much as they‚Äôre much shorter time hanging). All of which are very important across a lot of different disciplines. Endurance workouts also improve general fitness as they‚Äôre far more cardiovascular and burn more calories also. \n\nIf you also want to get your pull-ups into the really high ranges like 40-50+ then endurance training is crucial (60-70% of your max bw reps for 5+ sets is what I always do); many guys think because they can do 100lb pull-ups that they can do that many already but can‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt have enough training on things like prolonged grip endurance and their arms start burning much sooner than they expect. \n\nI have also personally found through myself and friends that endurance translates much better to strength than the other way round. A lot of climbers can do one arm pull-ups with little to no training despite training almost exclusively endurance (I got my OAP out of nowhere), while I‚Äôve seen a lot of guys who exclusively train strength and can do very heavy weighted pull-ups for 4-5 reps but struggle to hang on a bar for a minute. \n\nI also think that training exclusively very heavy weights for low reps puts you at much higher risk of injuries, especially tendonitis as tendons get more aggravated by high load rather than high repetitions. Replacing some of these heavy sets with lighter/higher rep sets can reduce the incidence of this. \n\nI‚Äôm not necessarily saying that training one is better than the other. Strength training has huge benefits like on your rapid fire neurons and fast twitch muscle fibres, explosive pulling power, as well as one arm pulling which is beneficial for many sports. But my point is the difference in skills you gain from training each style provides a strong argument to diversify one‚Äôs training programme with calisthenics; you get the best of both worlds while limiting the downsides of training in one particular way. \n\nOver the last year I started training one strength and one endurance session per week per muscle group (except legs where I do mainly plyometrics as I don‚Äôt want bulky legs for my sport), and the progress I‚Äôve seen has been huge despite me having trained many years already. \n\nTrain however makes you feel good or what is appropriate for your sport or your goals (obviously if you‚Äôre a pro power lifter then just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing lol) but I thought I would just mention this as many people I know switched from strength only to strength/endurance (some due to overuse injury) and are really enjoying the additional benefit from training their own bodyweight.",

Many people already train for muscular endurance through simply doing their sport sport (e.g., climbing, cycling, etc).

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>‚ÄúI live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I‚Äôm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I‚Äôll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.‚Äù\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don‚Äôt object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a ‚Äútrue‚Äù hydroxy acid ‚Äî it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned ‚Äúrules‚Äù of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn‚Äôt the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis ‚Äî at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. ‚ÄúPCA SKIN‚Äù also has another product with AzA called ‚ÄúACNE GEL‚Äù. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the ‚Äúpigment bar‚Äù it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There‚Äôs also ‚Äú*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*‚Äù you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion‚Äù\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There‚Äôs 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description‚Äôs wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low ‚Äî meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

    "body": "#My Background\n\n10 years ago I was crippled with back pain which I thought was sciatica (actually was piriformis syndrome). It was so bad that sometimes I would need to crawl to the bathroom in the middle of the night. My girlfriend (now wife) would have to help me put my own underwear on sometimes. During finals week, sometimes my back pain was so bad that I would need one friend under each arm to help carry me like a set of crutches.\n\nIt turns out during that time I had Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), but didn‚Äôt know I had it until I was 31. **AS is a lifelong incurable disease where your immune system constantly attacks your spine and keeps it inflamed.** Spinal degeneration such as in the lumbar and SI joints is common. In some severe cases, AS will lead to fusing of the spinal vertebrae, bamboo spine, or hunchback spine, which could severely limit mobility. *I have not gotten to that point nor do I intend to ever let my body get to that point.*\n\nMy back pain issues were caused by piriformis syndrome, which was amplified by the AS. However, I managed to get the piriformis syndrome under control, and was able to start going to the gym again. I was motivated as hell to get stronger because when you are crawling to the bathroom in the middle of the night wondering ‚Äúis this going to be the rest of my life?‚Äù that serves as some of the strongest motivation to never go back to that dark place.\n\nWell, I spent about 8 years in the gym on and off due to back pain flare ups and got nowhere. I thought I knew what I was doing, but I didn‚Äôt. I eventually learned how to bulk/cut better thanks to many friends and great resources along the way. Since I learned to get my Calories and Training in check, I‚Äôve been seeing great results through my bulking and cutting.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Pictures and Stats\n\nMy stats: Male 31 y/o. 6‚Äô tall. 160lbs.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/9jKe6\n\nI did a DIY photoshoot in my home gym after the cut ended. The lighting setup was quite easy to do. I wanted to do the photoshoot to celebrate my progress, but also to have some fun with some silly pictures. I don‚Äôt like to take myself too seriously in all progress pictures. One picture in particular is that [belly fat/skin squeezing picture](http://imgur.com/xYsnjdu). I wanted to show that in those ‚Äúfitness photoshoots‚Äù the models don't always look that great in all angles. I‚Äôd love to see shredded fitness models take some great looking pictures as well as some pictures showing themselves in the most unflattering poses.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Diet\n\nTDEE = 2800 cal/daily\n\nBMR = 1800 cal/daily\n\n###Bulking\n\nWhen I was bulking, I regretfully did a dirty bulk. I had a hard time gaining weight before I learned to track calories and eat above my TDEE. Once I started to gain weight, I got a little too excited and got carried away with my weight gain. Well, once I only had 1.5 pairs of shorts left that would fit, I knew it was time to start cutting.\n\n**Dirty Bulk** -- I ate about 3300-4000 cal daily.\n\n**Clean Bulk** -- Next time I will aim to eat only 100-500 cal above my TDEE and strive to gain about 0.5-1lb/week max. I learned my lesson with the dirty bulk!\n\n###Cutting\n\nWhen I was cutting, I eventually worked my way down to about 1600-1800 cal/daily. This took a long time to reach. Initially, when I dropped my calories from 3300/daily to 2800/daily, I was starving out of my mind for the first week. My body adjusted, and from there on out I slowly chipped away at my calories week-by-week and month-by-month until I eventually got to the 1600-1800 cal/daily range. \n\nI also employed **intermittent fasting**. I skipped breakfast and just ate a bigger lunch/dinner. The dinner was especially important to me because I needed to go to bed feeling full to get a nice night‚Äôs sleep.\n\n**Cutting Calories/Macros** -- I typically ate **Protein** 0.8-1g/lb, **Fat** 0.3-0.4g/lb, **the rest from carbs**. Towards the end of my cut, my protein intake started to get closer to 0.6-0.8g/lb and I did not notice any losses in strength. Of course, my volume went down by about 20% per workout. Some weeks I was really low energy and I could feel my body giving up even more volume on those days.\n\n**Refeed Days** When it came to overcoming plateaus, refeed days helped the most. A refeed day is basically a day where you eat at your TDEE (or bulking calories), which basically includes macros of a ton of carbs, very little fat, and your normal protein. This is NOT a cheat day! A cheat day is when you just eat whatever and don‚Äôt care about macros/calories. A refeed day is very specific in goals, and it can feel great like a cheat day.\n\nExample macros for me are: **Protein** 180g, **Fat** 10-20g, **Carbs** 500g\n\nOn refeed days, I would often take protein shakes, bagels + jam, bread, rice, pasta, pancakes, fruit, and other delicious high carb foods. It was therapeutic and glorious. \n\nRefeed days are useful for anyone who has an active lifestyle, has been in a calorie deficit for at least a few weeks, and has been losing weight, but starting to plateau. Refeed days will replenish depleted glycogen stores while spiking leptin levels. Leptin is the main hormone we are targeting on refeed days. Leptin going back up will help keep the metabolism sped up as well as help resume fat loss and other hormonal benefits. Refeeds can be leveraged anywhere from once a week to once a month. The leaner you are the more often you will need it.\n\nTypically, I would do a refeed day and my weight would spike 1-2lbs, and then 1-2 days later I would suddenly lose multiple pounds and my weight loss would resume (A lot of this was food/water weight). My workouts would feel better the week after a refeed as well.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Training\n\nFor my training, I prefer a High Intensity, High Volume, and Low Frequency 5 day split (with 2 days of rest before repeating). There is evidence to support this style of training as well as evidence showing other styles of training (e.g., High Intensity, High Frequency, Low Volume) are great as well. I believe we can all find workout routines that work for our own lifestyles. This one works great for me. Also, I do all these workouts in my home gym (more info on that below).\n\nI should also note that my goals are to build some strength and look good/feel good by developing all my bodyparts so nothing is lagging behind. I‚Äôm not in a race to do 400lbs squats because my routine is not optimal for that and also because of my AS and SI Joint degeneration, it is unlikely I could ever physically do 200lb squats. \n\nPeriodization is essentially built into my daily workouts. I start off with heavy compound lifts for every day, then as the workouts progress, I shift to higher and higher rep ranges to try and stimulate all the rep ranges for hypertrophy. The 3 pathways to hypertrophy are:\n\n* Progressive Overload (tension/load gets progressively heavier over the course of weeks/months)\n\n* Metabolic Stress/Fatigue (sets last longer than 45 seconds, giving you that pump and lactic acid burn)\n\n* Muscle Damage (full range of motion, nice slow eccentric phases)\n\nOut of these 3, Progressive Overload is the most important. 80%~ of my workout is dedicated to progressively overloading with heavy tension in the lower rep ranges. The last 20%~ of my workouts is for hitting Metabolic Stress and Muscle Damage pathways of hypertrophy, which is when I do lighter weights with full ROM and long lasting sets.\n\n**Deload Weeks** -- About once every 2-3 months I would take a deload week. I‚Äôd take the entire week off or just cut both Intensity and Volume by 50% each.\n\n---\n\nResearch about why I prefer high volume, low frequency:\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17313289\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20300012\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27433992\n\nhttp://www.lookgreatnaked.com/blog/how-many-sets-do-you-need-to-perform-to-maximize-muscle-gains/\n\n---\n\n\n##Chest Day\n\n4 sets bench press 4-6 reps \n\n3 sets incline dumbbell press 6-8 reps\n\n3 sets incline bench press 8-12 reps\n\n3 sets of cable cross flys 12-20 reps\n\nOptional: 3 super sets of TRX ropes pushup/flys followed by immediate pushups 8-12 reps\n\nOptional: ab workout circuit (3 supersets of cable crunches, leg lifts, bicycle kicks, planks)\n\n##Back Day\n\n3 sets pull ups 4-6 reps\n\n3 sets chin ups 4-6 reps\n\n3 sets T-bar row wide grip 6-10 reps\n\n3 sets T-bar narrow grip 6-10 reps\n\n3 super sets of cable pull overs followed by immediate shrugs 8-12 reps\n\nOptional: 3 sets narrow grip pull down 12-20 reps\n\n##Shoulders Day\n\n4 sets standing overhead press 4-6 reps\n\n3 sets standing overhead dumbbell press 6-8 reps\n\n3 sets bent over side raises 6-8 reps\n\n3 sets bent over cable lateral raises 8-12 reps\n\n3 sets reverse flys on TRX rope 8-12 reps\n\n3 sets face pulls on Resistance Bands 8-12 reps\n\n##Legs/Abs Day \n\n(because of my preexisting back problems, I have to go easy on leg workouts, but anyone can add more if they want!)\n\n3 sets hexbar deadlift 4-6 reps\n\n3 sets squats 4-6 reps\n\nLeg circuit (3 supersets of kettlebell swings 8-12 reps, air squats, calf raises 8-12 reps)\n\nab workout circuit (3 supersets of cable crunches, leg lifts, bicycle kicks, planks, AMRAP)\n\nNote: If anyone wants to add in more leg work, consider adding in more quad dominant exercises after squats. Leg Press, Hack Squat, and Lunges are some great leg exercises to add\n\n##Arms Day\n\n3 sets skullcrushers 4-6 reps\n\n3 sets barbell curls 4-6 reps\n\n3 sets tricep extensions on cables 6-8 reps\n\n3 sets hammer curls with ropes (or do dumbbell curls) 6-8 reps\n\n3 sets reverse grip tricep push down (single hand) 8-12 reps\n\n3 sets concentration curls 8-12 reps\n\nOptional: 3 sets TRX rope tricep extensions 6-10 reps\n\nOptional: 3 sets TRX rope bicep curls 6-10 reps\n\nOptional: 4 sets of farmer walks for as long as you can hold it\n\nOptional: 4 sets forearm wrist roller 8-12 reps \n\n\n---\n\n###Cardio\n\nThe only cardio I did was LISS cardio (low intensity steady state cardio). There are 3 types of cardio, all with their own pros/cons (HITT, SS, and LISS). LISS worked best for my lifestyle as I have a DIY treadmill desk at work and at home. I would walk between 4-8 mild incline miles a day at my desk. For anyone else interested, the treadmill is only $200 on amazon (Confidence Power Plus Treadmill) and I have a [youtube video showing the disassembly of the treadmill's arm bars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Ef1Nec8IM). This disassembly turns the treadmill into a compact landing strip that can slide under any desk.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Home Gym Itemized List\n\nMy home gym was also essential in staying true to my goals. I have it set up such that it‚Äôs next to my PC. On heavy sets of lifting, I would play some PC games in between my long rests. Regardless, working out from home 5 days a week was very enjoyable. Here is an [imgur album of my home gym](http://imgur.com/gallery/kQZII)\n\nI'm absolutely satisfied with my investment in a home gym. I spent hours and hours researching the different equipment online before making purchases. I could not find any albums or complete descriptions that I was looking for, so I wanted to compile all my knowledge into a Google Doc for anyone else who is interested in doing something similar. \n\nI put together a few different tiers of home gym setups depending on how much space/money you have. If you have a lot of space/money, go to the \"FULL SETUP\" section of my google doc, which features the majority of my equipment there. Basically, I have a Power Rack, Olympic Weight Set, Olympic Dumbbell Handles, and more accessories. \n\n[Home Gym Item List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c2HVNbrNbiiewuulEGAw8u2kxyUgNM2rlcm57Z-Eogo/edit)\n\nIf you were ever thinking about doing a home gym, I highly recommend it! I want to help others and spread the info out there, so hopefully my google doc has compiled it together nicely. Feel free to ask any questions if I left anything out about it.\n\nTotal cost of all my equipment was around **$2000~**\n\n**Area Requirements:**\n\n*Minimum:* 8'x10' \n\n*Preferred:* 10'x12' or more \n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#What‚Äôs Next For Me and Conclusion\n\nI still plan to bulk/cut at least another 2 cycles. I hope to get to around 170-180lbs~ as my final weight after a few more cycles and then just maintain a healthy, strong, and good physique. I‚Äôm currently finishing up reverse dieting and will go back into bulking mode in a week or so.\n\nI‚Äôm happy to have gotten to where I am today despite having Ankylosing Spondylitis and crippling back pain. 10 years ago I could barely walk. Now I‚Äôm lifting weights in my home gym, live streaming my workouts while playing PC games, and helping my friends/viewers reach their goals IRL or on my [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/tominationtime).\n\n10 years ago I was in a very dark place feeling hopeless. I know some people reading this might be in a dark place as well. They might be feeling hopeless about being overweight trying to lose weight or underweight trying to gain weight. Maybe it‚Äôs a psychologically dark place or a physically dark place like Ankylosing Spondylitis. I can‚Äôt say your situation will get better like mine did. What I can say is that anything and everything can change. Tomorrow I could win the lotto or tomorrow I could be in a crippling car accident. 30 years from now my AS could completely go into remission or my AS could progress to where my spine fuses together completely.\n\nHopefully things will change for the better for all of us. What I can say is that 10 years ago I was wondering if my life would get better. I sincerely hope for you that 10 years from now you will be in a better place. 10 years from now you will see someone else on the internet who is in a dark place wondering if their life will get better. You will tell them ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say your situation will get better, but here is how my life changed these past 10 years,‚Äù and you will tell them your story of how you were in a dark place and things got better. Then 10 years later they will see someone else in a dark place and tell them their story of how things got better.\n\nLooking back on how hopeless I felt before, I realized that we all have a story to tell; sometimes we haven‚Äôt lived long enough yet to see the happy ending. \n\nIn the end, it is my belief that we are all in our own races to be the healthiest and strongest versions of us that we can be. We are running this race against no one but ourselves. We can sprint this race, we can jog this race, or we can walk this race. Sometimes I sprint this race (when I‚Äôm cutting). Other times I walk this race (when I‚Äôm squatting due to AS). Our progress can be big or small, fast or slow. As long as we keep trying to move forward we will achieve that strongest version of ourselves. My strongest version of myself might be different in 30 years if my AS progresses to the point where I‚Äôm in a wheelchair. I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôll still find a way to do curls and squeeze forearm grippers. My race may change from time to time, but it‚Äôs still my race and I will own it.\n\nEver since others have helped me along the way, I‚Äôd like to pay it forward. If others are struggling with a something or have any questions for me about anything, then feel free to ask me below or PM me if you‚Äôd prefer to chat privately and I‚Äôll try to stay in touch. For anyone who is gaming and fitness oriented, I run a Discord channel for other friendly fitness minded gamers. I don‚Äôt post it publicly to reduce the trolls, but if you‚Äôre interested, PM me for a Discord invite.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* My transformation actually took place over a 2 year~ period. However, due to some back pain flare ups, I had to take off about 6 months on and off during the bulk/cut cycles. During those times I just switched to maintenance mode and had to stop lifting.\n\n* During my time cutting, I experimented with a few different things. I tried supplementing with yohimbine, synephrine, caffeine (I drink coffee daily anyway), and some other misc. fat burning supplements. I did not see any noticeable effects. By far what helped me break past plateaus the most was doing the refeed days.\n\n* For general supplements, I took a lot of whey and casein protein. I also took 5g creatine monohydrate daily. I can‚Äôt say I noticed much of a difference with the creatine tbh. I usually took 2 shots of espresso before my workouts as well. \n",

    "body": "I want to start this off by just saying that I don‚Äôt usually complain too much outside of to my wife about my work, but right now I really need to vent. I‚Äôm admittedly a new nurse, been an RN for 15 months. I know this isn‚Äôt the worst night ever and I know I will have worse nights than this. Right now I just need to get this off my chest to fellow nurses so that I know it‚Äôs being heard by someone that can at least somewhat appreciate my night. \n\nI‚Äôm a float nurse, and I used to work on a tele floor. That floor often is staffed by the floats due to high turnover, so any night there is usually a bit rough to start with. I had asked for a downstaff since my daughters first day of daycare was going to be 10/25 but no luck, I was getting floated to my old floor. Oh well, that‚Äôs okay. \n\nI get in my usual half hour early and start looking up my patients. 2 were new admits, 1 was an ICU transfer, and one had been there a few days. I was also told I was already assigned the first admission of the night. The patients looked rough on paper but the chart doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story. \n\nMy shift starts at 19:00 and it‚Äôs 18:55 and ER is already falling to give report. They want to give report to a nurse from day shift and then have then give me report, but I interject and just take report myself because it made the most sense. Patient is being admitted d/t new afib HR in the 140s sustained. She got IV cardizem which brought it down but now it‚Äôs back in the 130s. She assured me she‚Äôll get another push ordered and get the HR down before sending the patient up. Awesome, sounds like this patient could need a drip but after talking to the ER nurse, who I know from working with her, she‚Äôd get my patient stable before sending her up. So I go about trying to get vitals on my other 4 patients quickly before this admission arrives. \n\nFirst patient I see, BP is 200‚Äôs/100‚Äôs. Okay let‚Äôs look at his meds and perfect, he has a couple antihypertensives, let‚Äôs just give those now and recheck later. I move on and get my vitals on everyone and they all look pretty okay. As I‚Äôm about to go pull my meds for the rest of patients I see my one patient has returned from dialysis and has family that wants to talk to me.\n\nAgain no big deal, just part of the job. I go in and answer all the family‚Äôs questions and listen to her concerns. Mom is 79, and just recently was diagnosed with breast cancer. However she‚Äôs had it for a while and just never took care of it. She has a massive mass that takes up her whole left chest, the mass measuring 8cm on X-ray. So apparently mom has extreme pain in the abdomen, has been nauseated all day, no normal BM in a couple days but passing some light gas. Bowel sounds are present but she is a bit distended. She‚Äôs also a dialysis patient though so it could be extra fluid. I had received in report the patient was getting IV fluids but had lost access and was unable to be restarted after several attempts. I was also informed she had a CT of the abdomen that wasn‚Äôt resulted yet. \n\nPatient was stable but uncomfortable so I went on my way to get meds. Daughter then again calls me in because mom was throwing up. Mom was throwing up yellow/brown foul smelling emesis. Uh oh. Now we need to do some digging. I look up the CT and see it was ordered STAT and a repeat order was put in. So I call down and ask why it wasn‚Äôt done and mow and behold it was done, but no results showed in the EMR. I did receive verbally the patient had a small bowel and would benefit from an NG tube. Now I‚Äôm getting a little worried and stressed. I ask for the results to be faxed up so I can call the provider for orders. While waiting for this the ER calls me and my patient is ready to come up. Not the best timing but that isn‚Äôt their fault so sure bring her up. I‚Äôm reviewing her orders and she‚Äôs ordered for a heparin drip. That must be a mistake though so I make a few phone calls and nope, no mistake. Okay, this is still fine I‚Äôll just get her up here and settled and get the drip going. \n\nAs I‚Äôm doing my initial assessment and vitals the daughter from our bowel obstruction lady comes in. Mom is throwing up a lot. Around 400mls a lot. To the charge nurse I go and I tell her call CT and get those results I need them now as my patient is vomiting stool. Return to afib lady and start getting her settled again. Finally finish that and my CT results are in. \n\nI call the provider and he‚Äôs pissed. He‚Äôs not upset with me and assured me this, but he is pissed this CT, which was done at 15:00, had no results given to him until after 21:00. While I‚Äôm on the phone with him I also mention my high BP guy (came down to 177/89) and he had a magnesium level of 1.6 which is low at my facility. He places orders for me. \n\nI now have a stat lactic acid, some IM dilaudid, and an NG tube to place on breast cancer lady. I have a 2g run of mag and additional hydralizine to pass on BP guy, and an entire admission history to do and heparin drip to start on afib lady. I also have 2 other patients I haven‚Äôt seen since 20:00 when I did my first set of vitals. Now I‚Äôm getting stressed. Now it‚Äôs seeming more than I can handle. But every other nurse had an ER coming to them and was busy. Okay just prioritize and do one thing at a time. \n\nDilaudid given. NG placed, lactic drawn. KUB ordered for placement. Okay great. Now BP meds and magnesium given and hung. Crushing it. KUB is back, tube not in stomach needs to be advanced. Shit, okay down. New KUB ordered. BP guy is diabetic. His HS sugar is 395. Orders are to call if over 350. Damn I just talked to provider he‚Äôll be pissed. Oh well. I wait to call until I have the lactic acid results. Repeat KUB says advance again 3-4 cm. I advance and immediately get about 200 ml of drainage. Okay now we‚Äôre in. Previously we had heard air and had some drainage and I had a second RN verify with me. My 3rd KUB is ordered. XRay is not happy with me tonight. \n\nStill no lab results so I pass meds on my other 2 patients. They‚Äôre asleep and comfortable. Finally lactic is back and only 1.2 so some good news. Provider called, informed of Blood sugar and orders given. Patient was hypoglycemic the previous morning so I questioned the order for 10 units of humalog but no changes. Okay fine I‚Äôll just give him a snack. Insulin and snack given, but now obstruction lady needs more pain medication. It‚Äôs 1:09 and she‚Äôs due at 1:15 so I give her another dose of IM dilaudid. She falls asleep. It‚Äôs now 1:30 and my 21:00 Med pass is done. My midnight meds are also passed. I have not even charged my vitals let alone anything else. I take a well deserved break to eat. \n\nAround 3 am I‚Äôm noticed obstruction lady is setting in the 70‚Äôs via our wireless pulse ox system. I go in and she‚Äôs naked at the foot of the bed covered in liquid stool with her NG fully taught. I immediately run in and get her sitting down and get help. She‚Äôs cleaned up and placed back in bed. At some point her bed alarm was turned off and I should have caught that but I didn‚Äôt. I make sure this time it‚Äôs on and re-educated her on the call light. She‚Äôs alert and oriented and I have the aids keeping a close eye on her while doing frequent rounds myself. \n\nFast forward to 5:30. I‚Äôve caught up on most of my charting. I had BP guys sugar checked again because I‚Äôm nervous he‚Äôll be low. I‚Äôm right, he‚Äôs 57. Juice and crackers given we‚Äôll recheck in a half hour. Obstruction lady is yelling up the ceiling ‚Äútake me take me‚Äù She‚Äôs very uncomfortable. I go in and she‚Äôs complaining of arm pain and a sore throat. I consider another dose of dilaudid but decide against it but check her vitals since I‚Äôm in there. BP 70/40. Call in the charge nurse to double check. 72/38. I tell her to go call a rapid. I listen to my lady and suddenly she‚Äôs in afib 110s-130s. This just keeps getting better. \n\nWe finally get an IV in her (#22) and give her a soft 500 ml boils. Patient is now lethargic and less responsive. Not responding to fluids. We narcsn her and she wakes right up. BP comes up too. Yay we fixed her. Now she‚Äôs having uncontrolled liquid stool. Her Iv site holds but the site supervisor wants to do a bedside midline insertion. No consent is signed and this patient is not competent. Now I have to get consent from the daughter along with another nurse and I have 2 patients left to see. Luckily they were taken care of by another nurse as I dealt with my rapid. \n\nAfter all is said and done we don‚Äôt place the midline but we do have consent now. My patient is lying in a puddle of stool and her room is trashed. It‚Äôs not 6:55. I‚Äôm informed afib lady has an infiltrated IV. She had the heparin drip. I go to call the provider and her HR is now 130s sustained. I go check on her and she‚Äôs just lying in bed. So I check vitals and she‚Äôs sure enough in the 130s. I have another nurse get a new IV in as I call for orders to get her HR controlled. This is during shift change so nothing was done. I left at 08:30 and orders had just been put in. \n\nI felt so bad giving this team to my incoming nurse. I did everything I could and still feel like I left a mess. For the first time I actually had tears in my eyes. Bowel obstruction lady was a huge delay in care and all of that could have been avoided had the day nurse been more vigilant. She is on her 3rd orientation from constant write ups. Every issue I had could have been avoided if this obstruction was caught, or if they followed up on her tests. I got a very shoddy report and was pretty upset. I did speak with the nurse manager and I documented the hell out of everything. \n\nThe other issues through the night were just annoyances and just compounded my stress. All my patients were stable when I left. I had fixed multiple problems and gave the best care I could. I feel like a stronger nurse because of it. Thank you to anyone who actually read this novel, as I said I just needed to vent it all out there. ",

    "body": "Ten years ago, I wanted to learn how to make sourdough because nothing I could find in the stores even remotely resembled the real stuff you could buy in San Francisco. So I did a lot of research, made my own starter from scratch, and learned how to make bread.\n\n**The starter:**\n\nSourdough starter is a SCOBY - a Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast. The bacteria is primarily Lactobacillus - the same critter that turns milk sour. The yeast is natural yeast, which means it will rise slower. \n\nHere‚Äôs the fundamentals of how it works: Yeast eats the sugars in the dough, and converts them into alcohol and CO2. Lactobacillus eats the sugars and produces lactic acid. Together, the CO2 from the yeast makes the dough rise, and the lactic acid gives it the familiar tang of sourdough.\n\nCommercial bread yeast has been bred to produce little alcohol and a lot of CO2. It will make your dough rise in just a couple of hours. However, this is not enough time for the lacto to produce enough lactic acid to make it taste like sourdough. Commercial sourdough starters have you produce and feed a large starter over the course of days in order to develop enough lactic acid for it to taste kind of like sourdough, but still rise quickly.\n\nThat‚Äôs fine, but I prefer the traditional way. Make a  thick slurry of flour and water, and leave it open on the counter to ferment for a couple of days. This will develop the natural yeast and bacteria in the environment.\n\n**The method:**\n\nI generally have a cup of starter in a pint jar in the fridge. I dump the whole thing into a large mixing bowl, add a cup of flour and enough water to get it back to that slurry consistency. Leave that out to proof, and once it‚Äôs working, take a cup of that out for baking and put a cup back in a jar in the fridge. This is the same concept as a sour mash - you just keep feeding and producing more in the same cycle, over and over.\n\nYou don‚Äôt need a big starter, because you‚Äôre using natural yeast. I use about a cup for two loaves. The dough will rise slowly over the course of about 18 hours, giving the lactobacillus plenty of time to develop in the dough itself. Eighteen hours. That‚Äôs the first rise. The second takes about 6. Keep that in mind.\n\nAs for the dough itself, this is where I think a lot of people struggle. The key, like in any white bread, is developing the glutens. I won‚Äôt get into that in depth, you can look it up. But the first thing is to use bread flour, which has a high gluten content. If you can‚Äôt get it, and even if you can, a gluten rest is your friend. Mix the dough without the yeast and let it sit for 45m-1hr. This allows the glutens to develop.\n\nThen comes the kneading, and this is by far the most important part. If you have a professional stand mixer (and by that I mean Hobart, not kitchenaid) then I envy you. Knead the dough for 45m-1hr or until the dough panes. You cannot, I repeat, CAN NOT skimp on this step. I use the stretch and fold method. The good news is that you will have the firearms of a Greek god after a couple of months of bread making.\n\nThen it‚Äôs a waiting game. Make a ball of dough, coat it lightly in olive oil, loosely cover in Saran Wrap, and put it into a large bowl or whatever you typically use. Give it about 18 hours and it should be doubled in size. Punch it down, divide it and form your rounds, and let it rise again. Keep them covered and oiled, because they‚Äôre going to take another 6 hours. I make the rounds on individual parchment sheets for easier handling later. \n\n**The baking:**\n\nThe hotter the better, in my opinion. I bake mine at 500 degrees. I let the oven warm up with a pizza stone in it, along with a small bowl of water to create humidity.\n\nI brush the rounds with beaten egg and a little water, slash them, and put them directly on the hot pizza stone using a peel. Well, not directly. You should transfer the parchment with the dough for easier handling.\n\nBake until the crust is golden brown and it sounds hollow when you thump it.\n\nHope that helps! Here to answer any questions you might have. Sourdough is a lot of work, but this method produces something amazing that you just can‚Äôt buy in a bakery. Unless you happen to live in San Francisco.",

    "body": "So! I know a lot of people are trying to reduce their waste when it comes to using sheet masks and trying to opt for the larger packages. I've been using Lululun masks for a while, and I thought I'd share the little reviews I wrote of each mask that I tried. I particularly like Lululun because they're a little easier to find, also come in 7-packs that travel well, and because (except for the Plus and Premium lines) they're unscented. I know a lot of people have been looking to try them, too, but the types and how well they work is pretty confusing, so I hope this clears it up and can possibly be seen as some sort of guide?\n\nThese reviews have been written over the past year or so, and includes all of the masks (to my knowledge) from the standard, Precious, and One Night lines, plus some of the Premium and one Plus mask. I haven't tried the Lululun One line (they're extremely expensive here--like, T&T wanted $25 for a package?) or any of the standard skincare items like the cleansing balm or creams (since they're not stocked near me and YesStyle wants an arm, leg, and my first-born child for them).\n\nThese masks were purchased in the US and Canada, but I'm Canada-based and can't really answer for any sources outside of the ones I bought my masks at. I have dry, redness-prone skin, and my skin pre-mask was generally the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and either The Ordinary's 10% Lactic Acid or Stridex in the red box, since I tend to sheet mask after using acids. \n\nWhen I was unsure, what I've said the mask does is generally taken from translations either from [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/), [Don Quijote's worldwide site](https://mpglobal.donki.com/en), or the [Lululun USA website](https://www.lululunusa.com/). While doing these reviews, I also liked looking at the resources from [StarrySkin's Lululun Series](https://starryskin.com/2015/05/11/lululun-sheet-masks-whats-up-with-all-the-damn-colors-part-1/) and [watching SekineRisa's video on all the Lululun masks (Japanese language only)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vahN1yUc4x8). \n\nNot in order of how I tried them, just organized by type.\n\n**Standard Lululun**\n\nPink Type (Moisture Balance)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased at various places over the years--YamiBuy, T&T Market, Amazon, and a local shop that has since closed.\n\n* Like all the regular masks from the Lululun lines, this has no scent, which is nice. After it dries down onto my face, it still feels a little dry? I don't feel moisturized afterwards, though, just like I have something on my face. If you have dry skin, you definitely can't use this as a standalone mask.\n\n* Would I rebuy? It's not my first choice, but I suppose I would if it was the only mask available.\n\nPurple/Blue Type (Deep Moisture) (I think the packaging looks purple, but people call it the blue type.)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, also purchased at various places--same as before, plus my first pack was bought at Ricky's in NYC.\n\n* The serum in this mask is noticeably thicker than the pink type. I rebuy this one a lot, especially when I'm traveling, since it works really well when you're going all over the place and your skin is going crazy. I still can't use it on its own for moisturizer, but it's way better than nothing. It has also helped fade some irritated red spots in the short-term.\n\n* Would I rebuy? I have multiple times. It's really good.\n\nWhite Type (Brightening)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased in various places like the others.\n\n* I'm very biased towards this one, since it's my third 32-pack. It's a little moisturizing, surprisingly more than the pink type for me? It's a really good standard everyday sheet mask if you're just looking for that extra layer of moisture and not much else. Like the blue/purple, it also fades some irritated red spots in the short-term.\n\n* Would I rebuy? I have multiple times.\n\n\n**Lululun Precious** (Anti-aging)\n\nRed Type (Moisturizing)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes--have purchased at Miniso and a local shop, though I've also seen it in stock on Yamibuy, Amazon, and in T&T.\n\n* Like the standard line, the Precious line has no scents. It's kind of in between the moisture of the pink mask and the blue/purple...not nearly as deep as the blue/purple, but still pretty moisturizing. After taking it off, it feels like I've put on a light moisturizer.\n\n* Would I rebuy? If I can't find the blue/purple or green types, yes. It's good, I just tend to go for the other two.\n\nGreen Type (Deep Moisture)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased at local stores and at L'Amour Beauty in Toronto.\n\n* This mask allegedly has \"L22\", which \"imitates the sebum balance of a 22 year-old\". I'd describe it as a more oily type of moisturizing? After taking it off, it feels like I put on a standard lotion, and it takes a while longer to dry down compared to the other standard masks.\n\n* Would rebuy? Yes, I have a few times already. In terms of moisturizing masks, I'm tied between this one and the blue/purple type for my favourite.\n\nGold Type (Brightening)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased at same places as other Precious masks.\n\n* The biggest difference is that this one oddly felt a little cooler on my face? Like the other brightening mask, it faded my red spots a tiny bit, though I wouldn't say there was a noticeable difference. It's still nice to have, though.\n\n* Would rebuy? I have a few times, but I usually only buy the 7-pack for traveling since I feel like it's basically the same on my face as the white type in the standard line.\n\nPrecious Eye Masks\n\n* Worn for 15 minutes, purchased at L'Amour Beauty in Toronto.\n\n* First and foremost, I *love* how these masks are packaged. I didn't expect them to be packed like the face masks are--stacked on top of one another--but they are, so it looks like a mini version of the 32 packs of the normal masks. The material is a little thinner than the standard Lululun Masks, but thicker than, say, the Etude House eye patches. The serum dries on your face pretty quickly afterwards, too.\n\n*Would I rebuy? Yes, absolutely! I love how these are packaged and the amount that you get for the price.\n\n**Lululun One Night**\n\n(As a note, One Night masks are all single packages, so if you're looking for multi-use packets, this won't be good for you. They're nice for special occasions, though, which is generally what the package indicates them for.)\n\nBlue (Clarifying)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased at L'Amour Beauty in Toronto and also on Yamibuy.\n\n* When I tried this, my face was a wreck. I was sleep-deprived, I had a huge zit on my chin, my face was red for no reason. I was kind of hoping this would help at least a bit...and lo and behold, it did. Lululun One Night masks come with an ungodly amount of serum in the packaging--like, it took ten minutes to dry after I took it off--and it feels great to put on your face, though the material is a little less stretchy than the standard masks. In the morning, my face was actually a whole lot clearer? It cleared up within a few days, and trust me, the outside factors that were making my skin irritated in the first place (cough cough *grad school*) were not getting any better. So, I definitely trust this.\n\n* I would rebuy this and I already have, though I keep it stowed away in a drawer just in case.\n\nOrange (Vitamin C/Brightening)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, bought on Yamibuy\n\n* Like the blue one--there's a ton of serum, which means it took approximately 30 years to dry, and while you don't see immediate results, my skin looked *so* much better in the morning. It cleared up some of the red spots on my chin from where I previously had acne, and my face in general was just way brighter.\n\n* I would definitely rebuy this, and I have a few stowed away.\n\nPink (Moisture)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, bought on Yamibuy\n\n* I like this one, but I definitely would need to try it out again in the winter time. It worked great to moisturize my skin, and my skin definitely wasn't as dry in the morning as it can be sometimes.\n\n* Would rebuy? Maybe? It worked out well, but the purple/blue and green work pretty well for the same thing. Maybe if my skin was obscenely dry for some reason.\n\nGold and Blue (Anti-aging Clarifying)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, bought at L'Amour Beauty.\n\n* Personally, this worked about the same as the standard blue One Night for me. I didn't have as much to clear up this time, but it still made my skin feel pretty good afterwards and some of my post-breakout scarring faded again.\n\n* Would rebuy? No, but only because the standard One Night blue mask does the same thing and is easier to find.\n\nGold and Pink (Anti-aging moisture)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, bought at L'Amour Beauty.\n\n* I used this when my skin was going to be pretty wrecked (working 8AM-10PM for four days in a row plus graduating, oof) and God, did it make me at least kind of look like a presentable human being. I did it the night before I graduated, and despite being sleep-deprived, I looked pretty good in my graduation photos, so it must've done something right.\n\n* Would rebuy? No, just because, once again, the standard line is a little more accessible.\n\nGold and Green (Anti-aging Resilience)\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, bought at L'Amour Beauty.\n\n* This one was...hard to gauge, since I'm pretty young and honestly, I'm not quite sure what this one is supposed to do? Most translations put this as \"resilience\", but against what? The lady at L'Amour Beauty said it has collagen, but I'm not in the target audience for that part, I think. Either way, it was nice, since my skin looked a lot less exhausted when I woke up the next morning.\n\n* Would rebuy? Probably not, maybe in the future when I actually need anti-aging products.\n\n**Lululun Premium and Lululun Plus**\n\nLululun Premium Line\n\n* Each mask was worn for 20 minutes, and purchased at various locations--YesStyle, a few local shops, oo35mm, L'Amour Beauty.\n\n* Look, I could type out reviews for each mask I tried, but honestly? They all feel and perform pretty much the same. I tried the Kyoto (green?) tea, lemon, lavender, sakura, peach, watermelon, and strawberry. They all kind of feel like a mildly more moisturizing version of the standard pink Lululun, but with scents attached to them. That's fine, but there's no specific benefit to buying one over the other. If you want to try them, just buy a scent that you know that you like. Also, they don't come in 32 packs, just in multi-packs of the 7 packs, so if you're going for the more environmentally-friendly route, this might not be it.\n\n* Would rebuy? I've rebought the lemon type a few times since I like the scent, but I wouldn't buy the others again, and some I just gave to a friend since I didn't want to finish the packs off.\n\nLululun Plus Clary Sage \"Aroma Care\"\n\n* Worn for 20 minutes, bought at T&T.\n\n* I like the quality of the mask, so let's put that out there. The cotton is thicker, though not as stretchy, compared to the standard masks. If you don't like buying individual mask packs, though, don't buy this, since it's a package with 5 individually-packaged masks. For the life of me, I *cannot stand* this mask. I tried it twice, and I tried to like it, I really did, but the smell is just so overwhelming. It's the equivalent of putting Vick's under your nose--the scent is just there all. The. Time. It didn't do much in terms of moisturizing and soothing, either.\n\n* Would rebuy? Absolutely not. I wound up giving the extra masks out of this box to a friend.\n\nSo, that's all the reviews I have! **If you're looking for a tl;dr: I have dry skin and I really like the blue/purple, white, and precious green types. The One Night masks are really nice at doing what they're supposed to do. The Plus masks literally stink, and only buy the Premium types if you like the scent.** If anyone has any questions (besides \"why would you do this to yourself?\", to which the answer is \"God knows\"), feel free to ask in the comments!",

    "body": "# Race Information\n\n* **Name:** Tokyo Marathon\n* **Date:** March 2, 2025\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** Tokyo, Japan\n* **Time:** 3:06:30\n\n# Goals\n\n|Goal|Description|Completed?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|A|Sub 3:00|*No*|\n|B|Sub 3:05|*No*|\n|C|PR (prev 3:17:11)|*Yes*|\n\n# Splits\n\n|Mile|Time|\n|:-|:-|\n|1|7:21|\n|2|6:20|\n|3|6:44|\n|4|6:53|\n|5|6:39|\n|6|6:40|\n|7|6:54|\n|8|6:58|\n|9|6:41|\n|10|6:38|\n|11|6:51|\n|12|6:53|\n|13|7:08|\n|14|6:52|\n|15|7:01|\n|16|6:58|\n|17|7:08|\n|18|7:00|\n|19|7:05|\n|20|7:09|\n|21|6:59|\n|22|6:50|\n|23|7:19|\n|24|7:10|\n|25|7:40|\n|26|7:59|\n|26.2|7:07|\n\n# Pre-training\n\nThe Tokyo Marathon was such an unforgettable experience. It was my first World Marathon (second marathon overall) and everything from start to finish was incredible. Highly recommend for anyone wanting an overseas marathon that is decently flat, highly organized, and gives you a tour of the Tokyo highlights. After participating in a World Marathon, I can now understand why runners seek out the six Abbott Marathons. Maybe I'm feeling this way because I still have lingering effects of that Runner's High, but others must feel this way about the Tokyo Marathon as well.\n\nI participated through a charity and was lucky enough to get in. I applied a day or so after the charity entry opened, and believe I was lucky to get in as many charity options were already closed due to the number of applicants. After that, the process went pretty smoothly, just waiting for emails from the Tokyo Marathon and the Charity. Everything was very well communicated via email; had just the right amount of emails from them to feel in the loop without it feeling like spam.\n\n# Training\n\nFor my training I originally sought out a 12 week foundational block (build up to 30-35 miles per week) and then 18 weeks of an intermediate plan, both from the Hal Higdon Marathon Plan website. Between my first marathon in March 2024 and my training block, I was running no more than 50 miles per month, with one of those months only running 18 miles. Thus, I felt like the 12 week base block would get me up to speed.\n\nAfter I completed the 12 weeks and about a week into the intermediate plan, I felt like I could push myself a bit and decided to switch to Pfitz's 18/55 plan. I really enjoyed the challenging runs and felt like I had more of a purpose during some of the workouts instead of just trying to get the prescribed miles in (even though I still was hyper focused on getting those miles which I think led to my downfall later on in training).\n\nI pretty much followed Pfitz's 18/55 plan down to a tee over the first 9 weeks, getting in all the lactate threshold, recovery, and marathon pace workouts in. I also utilized the treadmill often throughout the plan (accounting for 467 of the 1012 miles during the 30 weeks). During week 10 I skipped out on two 8 mile runs (a VO2 max and aerobic run) due to a road trip and then in week 12 I cut out two miles from my 17 mile run as the previous day I had a 10k tuneup race I ran in 39:49 on a hilly course and began to develop right leg pain...\n\nI couldn't identify the source of the leg pain early on, whether it was from my ankle, hip or knee, and figured it would sort itself out, so I continued to run. During my last marathon training block, I had developed pain to the right groin that had self resolved with rest. I didn't have pain in the groin this time, and I didn't rest.\n\nI felt my best around Week 13. I felt comfortable and strong hitting all the long runs and cardiovascularly, I felt great. My heart rate has peaked up to 171-175 during the high intensity stuff, but has always come back down with an average of 140-150. This week I hit 14 miles in 6:45/mile and felt like I could keep going which was a great sign until the pain set in again.\n\nI continued to run at the prescribed miles up until week 14, when I couldn't run the 10k-15k Tuneup race at a fast pace (7:34/mi over 10k) because of my pain. Despite this, I kept going, having to reduce my 11 mile mid week run the next week down to 7 miles, and then in week 16 the pain was at its peak. I found that at this point the pain would occur from the right lateral ankle up to the knee, possibly the thigh. It almost felt like I was hitting a nerve. It would worsen after hard runs, but then improve somewhat after 1-2 days of rest. Only pain with running, going down stairs, or jumping. I ran my third Tuneup race in week 16, but was limited again by the knee pain (6:43/mi 10k). The next on my long run day, I physically couldn't run for more than a mile due to the pain. I think the pain is to the right knee, and pretty certain I have runner's knee, but it's been difficult to isolate to a location even to this day. I haven't been diagnosed though, so not 100% sure.\n\nWeek 17 was a combination of light running and bicycles. I ran a total of 13 miles that week at about a 8:30 mile and combined this with anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes of bicycles for four days that week. I tried to mimic the VO2 workout on the bike the best I could, but my legs weren't used to the high power output on the bike, and I realized that I probably should have worked my legs out in different ways than just running throughout the training block. My leg pain was nonexistent on the bike which was great, and the light running helped but would still have that dull ache to the right knee which was of concern.\n\n# Pre-race: Tokyo, Japan\n\nWe fly out to Tokyo the Sunday before the race, week 18 of the training block. I'm still experiencing pain to the right leg but not as significant as it was during week 16. I run a total of 17 miles this week leading up to the marathon, staying around an easy pace, but trying to push myself to marathon pace on a few occasions. Overall I had improvement in the pain, but could still tell there was something going on, and not going through a proper taper was in the back of my mind.\n\nAlso, being in a new country/city for the first time, naturally you want to explore and indulge a bit. This was the second contributor to my sub-goal time I think. On top of the training, we walked between 10-12 miles each day that week, so up to 60ish miles on top of the 17 I ran. My legs were pretty conditioned so I didn't feel a real soreness or fatigue the day after, but the cumulative effect certainly affected my race day efforts I believe.\n\nRegarding nutrition leading up to the marathon, I tried to eat carbohydrates smartly, loading up on white rice, udon noodles, fruit juices, oatmeal, etc., whenever I could, but it's hard when there are so many different options you've never tried before. The two days before the marathon, I always started the morning with a bowl of an oatmeal/rice porridge combination, lots of fruit/fruit juices and bread, then throughout the day would eat sushi. I had a large bowl of udon noodles two nights before. The night before I didn't get to eat what I want since we were at a sporting event, and was stuck with the arena's options. I ended up eating a beef bowl with rice, fried chicken bites, French fries, and lots of water. The fried food ended up making me nauseous and I felt it sitting in my stomach the next morning unfortunately. An undisciplined mistake but I don't regret any of it.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nVery fortunate for the late race time at 9:10am! I woke up at around 6am, and had a bowl of oatmeal/rice porridge concoction and some fruit/fruit juice. I did a light jog for like 5-10 minutes and stretched. Hopped on the JR transit at 7:30 which took me to Shinjuku Station, and I walked on over to the entry location. I got past the checkpoints by 8:15am and stood to use the restroom. All super organized and check in was a breeze. At about 8:40ish I went to my coral and just stood there until the start. I wasn't use to this from my past experiences, where I could just show up 5-10 minutes beforehand, rollout of my hotel within walking distance, squeeze into my corral and just go. I took off my long sleeve I purchased from MUJI for like 1000 yen and donated it in the box next to the start area. I also brought a cliff block that I split up and ate the first half at 8:30 and second at 9am.\n\nAt 9:00am, there were pre-race intro/ceremonies going on, but couldn't hear or see very well due to the vast amount of people and me sitting in group C. At 9:05am the wheelchair races began, I saw a handful of people jump off to the side to use the restroom briefly since the line had disappeared, so I thought I would do the same. I thought I could just go back to my spot, but was redirected to a side entrance which was further back than where I started. Such a rookie mistake lol. But I'm glad I went because I didn't have to go at all throughout the race.\n\nThe gun went off at 9:10am, we started, and I didn't officially cross the start line until about 2-3 minutes afterwards.\n\n# Race\n\nAs you can see above, I was all over the place early on with my pacing. During my training block, I really tried to keep my pacing consistent throughout my runs, and my plan going into this was to run at a 6:48-50/mile average for the first half, and push for 6:40-45/mile the second half, but obviously didn't happen like that.\n\nGear: I had on Nike Alphafly 3's that had about 50 miles on them from training. I wore brief lined shorts and a dry-fit T-shirt and had a belt to keep my phone and energy gels. Weather was great (in my opinion), but did get warmer the last 3 miles. 50ish F the whole way until it started to creep up towards the end. I also wore Powerbeats Pro earphones. I didn't listen to any music the first 8 miles or so as I was taking in the environment. My right earphone died at about mile 14 though sadly.\n\nNutrition: I used Gus every 30 minutes, until the last hour and went every 15-20 minutes, accounting for 7 total.\n\nThe first mile I was just dodging people, trying to establish a good pace and get to the front, but I've never done this before and didn't develop a strategy for this beforehand. I just kept telling myself I need to find the 3hr pacer, but I never caught up due to where I started and they started with the gun. The dodging kept up pretty much the first 10k or so, so it was really difficult establishing a consistency. The half way point was also congested, and this is where I start to decline in my pace a bit.\n\nConcerning my leg injury, I felt it during the entire race. It wasn't a pain per se, but just knew it was there and a slight ache with every step. Perhaps it was the adrenaline that got me through the race regarding this injury, but it kind of affected me mentally. Like, there were times during the harder miles (mile 17-18ish and mile 22) where I caught myself thinking that it's okay if I didn't get my goal pace due to the injury.\n\nThe race overall was as expected. An initial decline towards the beginning and relatively flat the rest of the way. There was a significant hill later on, but I forget the mile marker and was able to just push through it. I grabbed water/pocori sweat at each station (often two cups of each), and it was a challenge running while drinking, as my first marathon I would just walk each station.\n\nAt about mile 17 I could feel the lactic acid catching up to me a bit, but still continued to push through despite the slowing in pace. Like I stated previously, cardiovascularly I felt great, just the legs. I also had moral boosts from my wife cheering me along the way which accounted for my boosts at the 20/21 mile marks.\n\nAt the 23 mile mark, the foam on the bottom of my left shoe seem to combust or something. At first I thought a paper cup was stuck to the bottom and I tried to shake it off, but every step felt significantly different, like less bouncy. At the end I looked and a piece of the foam and plastic on the outside heel tore off somehow lol.\n\nI kept looking at my watch and the kilometer markers the last three miles, and would get discouraged when I saw that my times weren't quite aligning up and that it seemed like I was running further than the 26.2 miles. Legs were significantly heavy but I just kept pushing through despite everything, as I didn't want to stop and lots of people were. My breathing became out of rhythm, and began to feel peak pain in the right leg in addition to the lactic acid buildup these last few miles. Finally, when I saw the finish line, I made a last second burst and crossed. And it was over like that. \n\n# Post-race\n\nAfter the race we were ushered based on our bib colors on where to go. Go a bunch of fluids and snacks as I slowly trodded towards the exit. Even though I felt in pain, it didn't feel all that bad, and even though I didn't achieve my goal, I was happy with the outcome. I executed everything I could that was within my control, and adapted to the situations that were out of my control. I love the marathon because of the discipline and journey; you learn quite a bit about yourself throughout training and can carry over those lessons to the inevitable next marathon. \n\nWe had to catch the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) to Osaka later that evening, but in the immediate aftermath I met up with my wife in the sea of people and went to the Charity Room to be greeted by so many volunteers. Such a memorable experience. \n\nWe had everything packed and I did my best to hobble to the trains, sat on the Shinkansen and ate a Bento Box for dinner. The next two days I was pretty tired and sore, but we booked a hotel appropriate for that. Really just chilled for 48 hours before enjoying Kyoto before we headed home. \n\nThanks for reading, hope this can be helpful to anyone that wants to run the Tokyo Marathon or has had similar mishaps in their training. My next one will be next year I think, but who knows.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

I ran Chicago last Fall and I was not prepared for how much energy I‚Äôd spend on that, and especially when I wanted to refuel or get fluids. I was much more mentally prepared with Tokyo. Also helps that it was a bit smaller than Chicago, though still like 36K people.\n\nAlso, post-race recovery at some of the local onsens (hot springs, sauna, etc.) was super nice! I saw a lot of other runners at the one I went to.\n\nAnyway congrats again! Do you think you‚Äôll try for another major?",

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin‚Äôs outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin‚Äôs water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin‚Äôs barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates‚Äîaspirin‚Äôs technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

    "body": "**Intro**\n\nI never thought I'd say this, but *Crossfit was right*. Sort of. Well, really the Old School was right. Allow me to explain. In our relentless pursuit of strength, it can become easy to forget that an impressive maximum weight pullup or planche is **not** the only important facet of fitness. As the functional fitness community once astutely pointed out, are you really fit if you can't express strength in a variety of situations?\n\nThe reality is that most activities of daily living, athletic endeavors, and strenuous physical jobs are hybrid activities, requiring a blend of various strength qualities. A soldier's 1 rep bench press is not assessed because it does not determine their readiness for the rigors of combat, nor does a footballer's max back squat determine if they have the leg stamina to withstand 90 minutes of intense play. Imagine a rock climber with an iron-strong grip that only lasts 10 seconds, or a swimmer with bulging lats that vomits as soon as their upper body muscles are flooded with lactic acid. What about a sprinter with strong legs that can't run fast? Or a ballerina who is only able to lift their leg up to hip height? This sort of dysfunction may seem ridiculous, but it's the exact sort of problem that can arise from training without variety and purpose. \n\n**Stuck at Step 1**\n\nI see many people's approach to strength training as boiling down to this.\n\n1. Get strong.\n2. ????\n3. Profit.\n\nAsk yourself, how much of your hard-earned strength can you really translate outside of a 1 or 5 rep max? Can you translate that strength into explosive force? Can you use your strength over a long period of time? Can you use your strength in extreme ranges of motion? Can you rely on your joints and tendons to handle the load you are putting on your muscles? Can you confidently say you're doing everything possible to perform better? Are you even coordinated enough to pull off the skills you want to accomplish?\n\nWhy are we only emphasizing one part of the equation? Is it not apparent, nay, obvious that (at least some of) our training should be be devoted to becoming a more well-rounded athlete?  We know, logically, that our bodies adapt only to the specific stimulus we expose them to. Yet our current paradigm leads us to pigeon-hole ourselves into the pursuit of maximal strength at the expense of all other athletic qualities.\n\n**Learning From The Old School Paradigm**\n\nThis is where I circle back to what I mean by the Old School. I consider the old school \"method\" as being military and prison-style workouts, the use of extremely minimal or no equipment, technical mastery of simple movements and focus on quality over quantity. Examples of this are the YouTuber Iron Wolf [https://www.youtube.com/@IronWolf84](https://www.youtube.com/@IronWolf84) or good old Al Kavadlo [https://www.youtube.com/@alkavadlo/featured](https://www.youtube.com/@alkavadlo/featured) \n\nThe old school has fallen out of style, for various reasons. I was fortunate to be exposed to the basic tenets of it during my first days at the gym as a kid, as my father showed me the merits of high repetition chinups, dips, leg raises, russian twists, and pushups. My first days of learning about calisthenics and training were also during the brief time on social media before online fitness trends became much more homogenous and heavily commercialized. Had I not had a fit parent who was of an older generation and also stumbled into some dusty corners of the internet, it is unlikely I would have ever seen this other way of looking at things.\n\nThe key takeaway was that I wasn't just training to get stronger. I was training to get *better.* I did not want to just have strong muscles, I wanted to *master* the movements. I wanted to be able to do pullups in my sleep, still have a picture-perfect leg raise at the end of a hard workout, and have no problem dropping and doing a few sets of crisp explosive pushups whenever I felt the need to.\n\n**A Mastery-Based Approach**\n\nWhen we look at the most accomplished athletes in the world, most of what they are doing is still just the basics. A 9 year old in a basketball rec league and Lebron James both have to dribble, pass, and shoot a ball. The difference is that Lebron James is orders of magnitude *better* at these movements. He has put in the time and effort to train his nervous system for maximum efficiency.\n\nStrength can be viewed the same way. It is not just the ability to produce force. It is an indication of neurological efficiency, a measure of *skill.* If you want to really progress beyond the beginner-intermediate level, train for years and avoid stupid injuries, absorb this idea. Focus on your goals, raise your standards for your training over time, build a strong athletic foundation, and attack your weakpoints in technique, mobility, endurance, power, etc. \n\nNow go out and do your best!",

By the Golden Throne, by the God-Emperor‚Äôs light, you\nsaved us. I beg you, in the name of Holy Terra, don‚Äôt abandon us now. The\nbeasts will come back, won‚Äôt they?‚Äô\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> I did not save you, thought Kantor. Alessio did.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>She was right about the orks. More would come. Many more. It was as\ninevitable as the sunrise. The ork bikers often rode at the head of a much larger\ncontingent. When that contingent arrived, there would be no saviours a second\ntime. The woman and her little ones would provide a brief moment of\nentertainment before they were butchered like the livestock they had once\ndepended on\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>But if we take responsibility for these people, Kantor thought bitterly, where\ndoes it end? Are we to save every other man, woman and child we happen\nacross? They will slow us down when our greatest need is to move quickly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>He grappled with the most human part of himself, fighting to lock it away\nbehind walls of resolve. He needed to crush these feelings of pity. They would\ndo him no good now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>The Chapter must endure, he told himself, repeating it like a mantra. The\nChapter must endure. Nothing else comes close. Good intentions will undo us.\nThey will lead to our destruction. If that happens, we might as well have died\nwith the others when the missile hit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>It was hard to do, but he stepped back and pulled his boot from under the\nwoman‚Äôs head. Only now did she look up at him, and her large brown eyes, wet\nwith tears, sought his.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>‚ÄòPlease, lord!‚Äôshe cried out. ‚ÄòWhat hope do we have alone?‚Äô\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>What hope, indeed, thought Kantor. I could say the same for my brothers and\nI. What hope do sixteen have against a Waaagh?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>He turned from her and called out to his men to make ready for their departure,\nthen he marched towards the fire where his three squads had finished theirchecks. The sound of her weeping followed him, clawing at his resolve.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>He heard his inner voice say, ‚ÄòTurn from those who need you, and you will\nlose everything that defines you.‚Äô\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Master Visidar had spoken those words to him just a decade before his death.\nKantor cursed, knowing them for truth\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>When he was ten metres from Jilenne, he turned and looked over his shoulder.\nHe felt himself speak to her, heard the words in his ears as if they were someone\nelse‚Äôs. They seemed to pass from his lips automatically.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>‚ÄòI will not stop you from trying to follow us,‚Äô he told her. ‚ÄòBut you will not be\nable to keep up. Not for long. While you can, however, no greenskin will take\nyou, nor any of your children.‚Äô\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>He turned his eyes forward again, adding, ‚ÄòThis is the best I can do for you.‚Äô\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>To Jilenne, it was enough. The timbre of her sobs changed from sorrow and\nfear to gratitude.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Kantor heard her urge her children to stand and follow as she fell into step\nbehind him. He continued towards the fire, not slowing his pace, but not\nincreasing it, either.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>All the same, as he and his Crimson Fists left the farming settlement with their\ngaggle of refugees in tow, Kantor couldn‚Äôt escape a feeling of deep foreboding.\nHe had crossed a line. The woman would soon realise he had given her false\nhope. She and her children would tire quickly and the Astartes would begin to\npull ahead until they disappeared from view altogether.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n... \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Cortez was sure the woman would collapse soon. The children she carried\nwere small, but even a small weight took its toll on a long hard march. It was a\npity. He found that he respected her a great deal. Her arms and shoulders must\nhave been burning with lactic acid, not to mention her legs and the muscles of\nher lower back. But she kept putting one step out in front of the other.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Then, just as he was about to turn around, he saw her left leg crumple under\nher and she went down, turning to protect her little ones from impact with the\nground even as she fell. It looked like her foot had snagged in a clump of grass.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Her other children shuffled to her side and crouched there, urging her to stand.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Fenestra had seen it, too. ‚ÄòIt is over, then,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòAbout time. We can move\nat speed.‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Cortez opened a link to the Chapter Master. ‚ÄòPedro, it‚Äôs me. The woman has\nfallen. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be getting up. I just wanted to let you know.‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n>There was a moment before Kantor replied. ‚ÄòShe fought hard to hang on.\nImpressive that she lasted as long as she did, is it not?‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>‚ÄòIt is,‚Äô said Cortez after a beat. ‚ÄòBut it ends here. Her burden is too great to\ncontinue.‚Äô Again he paused. ‚ÄòI‚Ä¶ I should not have saved her, Pedro. I merely\npostponed the inevitable and prolonged her torment. Perhaps I should‚Ä¶‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>‚Äò‚Ä¶grant her the final mercy?‚Äôsaid Kantor, finishing Cortez‚Äôs sentence for him.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>‚ÄòYes.‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>There was such a long pause this time that Cortez started to think the Chapter\nMaster had cleared the link. Then, finally, Kantor said, ‚ÄòHold position and wait\nfor me, but tell the rest of your men to keep moving towards the tree line. I want\nour squads in cover before the suns are visible.‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n...\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Even though Kantor‚Äôs armour was scratched, chipped, dented and burned\nblack in places, he still looked like a figure of legend, still everything a Chapter\nMaster should be. His golden halo shone in the growing light.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>When he was three metres from Cortez, he stopped and looked east. ‚ÄòThe suns\nwill be up very soon, Alessio. We should have been in the cover of the forest by\nnow. We run great risk of being spotted from the air.‚Äô\nCortez nodded. He knew the habits of the orks, knew they seldom flew at\nnight. Their eyesight was poor compared to their sense of smell, and darkness\nbrought a kind of malaise down on them without which they might have\nbutchered each other in the dark, so violent were their tendencies. They only\never launched night attacks by the light of flaming torches or searchlights, which\nwas doubly fortuitous because such lights made convenient markers for Imperial artillery fire. As soon as the suns were up, the sky would fill with noisy, ugly\nflying machines. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Kantor was right. They had to get to the cover of the forest\nwithin the next ten minutes.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>‚ÄòCome,‚Äô said the Chapter Master, and he strode in the direction of the children\nwhere they hovered over their mother‚Äôs unmoving form.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>The children heard the two massive Space Marines approaching and, with fear\napparent on their faces, took a few nervous steps back, conflicted between\nfeelings of concern for their mother and concern for their own lives. Cortez saw\nthem eyeing his weapons, especially his power fist. He wondered what they were\nthinking. Did they really believe he would crush them with it? In a universe as\ncruel as this, perhaps they did.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n>Come to think of it, what exactly were Pedro‚Äôs intentions? Did he plan to put\nthe entire brood out of its misery?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Kantor crouched at the woman‚Äôs side and removed his helmet.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Cortez tried to read his face, but it betrayed no emotion.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>‚ÄòJilenne,‚Äô said the Chapter Master. ‚ÄòCan you hear me?‚Äô\n\n\n>The woman‚Äôs eyes were closed, but her lips parted. Weakly, quietly, she said,\n‚ÄòThey were so heavy. So heavy‚Ä¶‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Kantor nodded. ‚ÄòYes,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòbut you did well to bring them this far.‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n>Reaching out, he lifted the two smallest children away from her and gestured\nto the older children to take them. They did so, and Kantor turned back to the\nwoman.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>The Emperor‚Äôs mercy, thought Cortez. You should not have to do this, Pedro.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>It is my fault. It is my soul that should bear the stain.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Before he could communicate this, Kantor spoke.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>‚ÄòIt is time,‚Äô he said, and he reached down to the woman with his gauntleted\nhands. ‚ÄòTime that someone carried you now.‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>As Cortez watched, the Chapter Master lifted the woman and stood to his full\nheight, cradling her exhausted form in his arms. She looked so small and fragile\nagainst his sculpted ceramite chest, little more than a rag-doll.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n>Then the Chapter Master turned to Cortez and said over the link, ‚ÄòOnce we are\namong the trees, they will have a better chance. They are charges of the Chapter\nnow, and we cannot abandon them.‚Äô\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>Carrying the woman as if she weighed nothing at all, Kantor began striding for\nthe distant tree line. Over the link, he added, ‚ÄòHelp the children, Alessio. Help\nthem get to cover quickly. The suns will be up within moments.‚Äô",

Check out the new and vastly improved version here:***\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1bs7nv/the_redditors_guide_to_acne_2013/\n\n---\n\nNote: I read every comment, and I am also regularly editing based on feedback. Please continue to contribute your questions and suggestions, and they will hopefully be addressed either with a response from me, or in updates to the guide. At no point will I consider this complete, so if there are more sections you want to see, or points you want some elaboration on, let me know.\n\n-------\nMost of us have gotten a lot of useful life tips from reddit, and it‚Äôs certainly a great source of collective knowledge on many topics. But there‚Äôs one thing that I‚Äôve noticed people here are not good at: acne. The best we‚Äôve managed as a collective is \"put a clean towel on your pillow every night\". But in reality, there is no cure, and no one simple thing is going to change that. Acne is caused and helped by different things for different people. Dirty skin is not likely to be the real cause, so slight hygiene improvements can only help so much. Generally speaking, what works for someone else won't work for you, and sometimes most of the things that SHOULD work don't. I know how frustrating that is, having tried numerous products over the past few years, and finding that even the best ones don't help, or lead to more problems. It's made especially hard because the Internet is filled with misinformation and ignorance about how to treat acne, and it can be nearly impossible for most people to distinguish the good advice from the baseless crap that makes up 90% of acne-related websites. \n\nI've tried to extract the useful information from all this, approaching the problem from various angles rather than recommending a specific product or regimen. Despite what people in almost every reddit acne thread keep telling you (and there has been a lot of awful advice in those threads), there is no miracle product or easy fix. You need to understand a lot more about skin care and acne before you can understand how to treat your own problems, and what you do will depend on your skin type and the nature of your acne.\n\n**Basic Acne Treatment**\n\nBefore continuing, I suggest reading [this](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/best-acne-fighting-products.aspx) summary of acne, its causes, and most of the treatments available for it. [Acne.org](http://www.acne.org/), though questionable at times, is worth reading through for more info. It also has user reviews of every product, home remedy and other treatment, both internal and external. [This thread](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/index.php/topic/102347-biggest-mistakes-people-make-to-treat-acne/) addresses a lot of the common mistakes you may be making. The forums CAN provide useful information like that, but be careful, as there's also a lot of unreliable advice and anecdotes. Remember, what works for someone else may not work for you, and sometimes people make mistakes when assessing their own results.\n\nYou can get a reasonable amount of detail from those links (and more from checking Wikipedia/Google results for anything listed there), and I suggest reading them before this FAQ. I'm just going to summarise the pros and cons of some common acne treatments. (You can see a fairly comprehensive list [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Acne_agents).)\n\n*Benzoyl Peroxide (BP)*\n\n* Examples: [Acne.org](http://www.danielkern.com/product-p/treatment-8.htm), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/product/clear-acne-fighting-treatment/acne-treatment-clear-skin), [Serious Skin Care](http://www.seriousskincare.com/product_p/clearzitnano.htm) (5% only, but no other product effectively combines benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil), [Oxy](http://www.oxyskincare.com/our-products/oxy-clinical-clearing-treatment/) (5% only), [ProActiv](http://www.proactiv.com)\n\nPros:\n\n* Kills acne bacteria better than anything else you can get OTC, strong support from studies.\n* Also has some keratolytic effects due to its skin peeling properties, so it can clear pores.\n* Widely available and commonly used, relative to comparable products.\n\nCons:\n\n* Dries out skin\n* High sun sensitivity (use sunscreen)\n* Bleaches clothes and sheets\n* It can be harsh, irritating and drying: many people will have some kind of negative reaction, and those who are allergic or have sensitive skin can't tolerate it at all. (I don't use BP for this reason. If you do, I recommend trying a 2.5% product, as stronger ones have worse side effects, and there's little evidence that they're more effective.)\n\n*Salicylic Acid / Beta Hydroxy Acid / BHA*\n\nExamples: [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/category/bha-aha-exfoliants), [Neutrogena](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/oil-free+acne+stress+control-+3-in-1+hydrating+acne+treatment.do)\n\nPros:\n\n* Best exfoliant: helps remove dead skin and encourage new growth, which both prevents pore blocking and improves hyperpigmentation (red/dark marks).\n* Unclogs pores and restores them to their healthy size/funtion, excellent for blackheads/whiteheads.\n* Anti-inflammatory.\n* Can and should be spread all over the face to improve appearance and smoothness, not just as a spot treatment.\n\nCons:\n\n* Sun sensitivity (always use sunscreen!)\n* Still can't be used by some, especially if you have an aspirin allergy or salicylate sensitivity\n\n*Other Exfoliant Info*\n\n* Alpha Hydroxy Acids (usually glycolic or lactic acid) are an alternative if your skin can't tolerate BHAs, but do not penetrate as deep into the skin, so they don't work as well against acne (but they do help with surface damage).\n* Physical scrubs only exfoliate superficially, not penetrating the skin like AHAs/BHAs, and their abrasive nature also means they can be more irritating (and more likely to accidentally scrub pimples), so these are not recommended. If you are going to go with a scrub, try to make it a fairly gentle one, or just use a washcloth with your cleanser.\n* I don't want to advocate specific brands for the most part, but most BHA products have too high a pH to exfoliate, or contain ingredients that make acne worse. Good ones are hard to find, so I would recommend getting them from Paula's Choice. They're the only brand that has a few different products with varying strengths (1%/2%) and bases (liquid/gel/lotion), so you can find the right fit for your skin type.\n* Start by using them once a day, at night, and if necessary, adjust the frequency based on how your skin responds.\n\n*Tea Tree Oil*\n\nPros:\n\n* [Functionally comparable to benzoyl peroxide.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2145499) \n* Doesn't have the drying or irritating side effects of BP\n\nCons:\n\n* Weaker than BP; takes longer to work and may have a lower success rate.\n* Lack of good tea tree products available, most are unlikely to be effective. \n* Highly volatile, may lose effectiveness from exposure to light or air. Be careful with the below method; buy small quantities and store it carefully.\n\nThe best way to get around the poor availability of good products is to buy 100% tea tree oil, and dilute it to 5% (i.e. 1:19) concentration in a carrier oil, such as jojoba. (Camellia oil and grape seed oil are a couple touted for their skin benefits, but I'm not sure if they block pores.) A few drops of jojoba can double as a light, noncomedogenic moisturiser, suitable even for oily skin. You don't really want to be using creams and lotions on oily skin anyway, as they risk making it oilier or clogging pores. I wouldn't rush to add TTO to other skin products, unless you just mix them in your hands before application. \n\nA similar product, called manuka oil, is made from a New Zealand plant (usually used to make a highly antibacterial honey), rather than the Australian tea tree. I haven't heard much about this being used for acne, but if anyone has tried it, let me know how it went. It's possible that this is just as effective as tea tree, or more so, but either it's obscure because of the lack of studies on it, or has so few studies on it because it's obscure.\n\n*Azelaic Acid*\n\nPros:\n\n* Combines some of the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and exfoliant/pore-clearing effects of the above products (I believe you need sunscreen with it for similar reasons).\n* Generally well-tolerated, usable on sensitive skin.\n* Very effective for hyperpigmentation left behind by acne (currently considered a possible safer alternative to hydroquinone for skin lightening)\n\nCons:\n\n* Poor availability: Whether it's OTC or prescription-only varies with the country. So far, the only place I know for certain it's OTC is Australia, where you can get the 20% lotion (Azclear) or 15% gel (Finacea). Some online stores will ship these internationally. I wasn't really sure whether this belonged here or in the prescription treatment section, but if you do reach the point of needing prescription topicals, this is a really good one to try anyway.\n* Some people may have bad side effects, especially in the first couple of weeks. I find it needs to be followed with a moisturiser.\n* Relative lack of research into its usage, effectiveness and precautions. Generally speaking, fewer people seem to have used it, so it's hard to assess how good it is.\n\nRemember that any of these will most likely take several weeks to start working, as acne that is already forming can take some time to come to the surface. If you want to know where to start, I suggest salicylic acid (or an AHA), then if it doesn't do enough on its own, try combining it with tea tree oil or BP. Azelaic acid is a great alternative, if you can get access to it. If these fail, you may want to see a doctor or dermatologist for stronger options. Before you do any of this, though, I recommend reading through the next few sections that cover how to look after your health, hygiene and skin in a way that will minimise your acne, which may save you needing to go further or spend more money.\n\n(Continued in the comments.)",

        "body": "**Skin Care**\n\nSo, you heard from someone (or from reddit) that Product X fixed all their problems, or you saw an ad that seemed like the answer to all your problems, or something just caught your eye on a store shelf. The first thing you want to know is if the product's claims are true, or just marketing bullshit. I would typically look it up on [Beautypedia](http://www.beautypedia.com/) first, which gives you an ingredient list and a basic assessment of those ingredients. (I'd love to include other comprehensive professional review sites here to account for possible bias/error, but I don't think there are any.) There are also a lot of options for [searching](http://www.beautypedia.com/AdvancedSearch.aspx) based on your skin type, the type of product you're looking for, and even particular ingredients you want or don't want, giving you a list of options to check out. If the brand you're looking for isn't there (more likely if you're outside America), you can look up ingredients on [Cosmetics Cop](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/A.aspx), which summarises most known info and studies on skin care ingredients. Sites like [Cosmeticsinfo.org](http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/) and [Personal Care Truth](http://personalcaretruth.com/) can complement this nicely if you want more in-depth scientific analysis, or just more information on something you're unsure of.\n\nI won't recommend specific brands or products, because really, while a certain one may work very well for a particular person, there is no \"special\" one. You just have to experiment. No product is unique, as the same ingredients can usually be found elsewhere. Also, every brand has both good and bad products, so you do need to check the specific stuff you're using rather than getting your entire regimen from one line.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, but MAKE SURE YOUR ACNE IS NOT BEING WORSENED BY ANY OF YOUR SKIN CARE PRODUCTS. So many people start with minimal acne, but they respond to it with bad products, which block pores or irritate their skin, leading them into a cycle of worse and worse acne. And yes, anything can be doing this - it doesn't matter if it says \"non-comedogenic\", \"hypoallergenic\", or \"natural\", as these terms aren't strictly defined or regulated. They're basically marketing lingo made to convince you that you're getting something \"safe\". While acne's primary cause is hormonal, many other things can exacerbate it by blocking pores or causing irritation that leads to increased sebum production. If you have sensitive skin, just about anything could be a culprit, especially cleansers. You can also save yourself a lot of time in checking new products by making sure they include none of the ingredients listed [here](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/skin-irritation-your-worst-enemy.aspx). These are less of a concern at the end of the ingredients list, though, as this implies a very small quantity. The first thing you should do if you think there may be a problem with your current products is to stop using anything containing [fragrance](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mjl/adv/2007/00000087/00000004/art00005), probably the most common cause of reactions that is unfortunately used very frequently.\n\n*Basic Skin Care Routine* \n\nThis is just a term I'm using to define, basically, a springboard from which you can modify and add products and steps as you experiment with your acne treatment. This really consists of three things that you need to get down before you start introducing anti-acne products and experimenting with other additions and substitutions. The idea is to start by using as few things on your skin as possible, then slowly adding more to see how they affect your skin.\n\nHere's what you need:\n\n* A gentle cleanser suited for your skin type. Avoid harsh, irritating/drying detergent cleansing agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate. Most of the others are considered less irritating, but there are some, like sodium laureth sulfate, that may be a bad idea for very sensitive skin. Note that an anti-acne cleanser is not necessary, and probably not even very effective, as the best anti-acne products need to be left on your skin to really work. Pick gentle/sensitive skin cleansers over acne-focused ones. Preferably don't use a bar soap, as many of these risk drying, irritating or blocking pores.\n* A toner or light moisturiser, depending on whether your skin is dry enough to need a moisturiser. If you have combination skin, you should treat the dry and oily areas differently. If you use a toner, make sure it doesn't contain alcohol or any other irritants. A toner has the benefit of not risking blocking pores. Jojoba oil is also a popular alternative. I find the easiest way to treat oily skin is to only apply a very thin layer of moisturiser (something like CeraVe or acne.org's moisturiser, or anything without oils in it).\n* Sunscreen (also covered in another section). This can and should be included in your moisturiser during the day, but not at night, so you may need two different moisturisers. (Note that there are moisturisers with sunscreen specifically for oily skin.)\n\nRemember, breakouts usually don't happen overnight, as acne can take weeks to form below the surface. This makes it very hard to actually identify whether something new is helping or hurting, so you may need to use something for a few weeks and see what happens. While a good product will take time to work, don't be fooled by claims of \"purging\". If you get *worse*, i.e. breaking out immediately from something new, stop using it.\n\n*Shaving* (for men)\n\nA lot of shaving products and aftershaves contain irritants, as well as razors themselves. The trend of adding more and more blades has really led to more irritating shaves, which isn't helped by the fact that these blades encourage you to rush and to push too hard on the skin. Two blades will lead to fewer problems than five blades. Better yet, though, check out /r/wicked_edge and get yourself a double edge safety razor. (I use an Edwin Jagger DE89BL, but see that subreddit for more details on everything you need and how to use it.) Learning how to shave in a totally new way takes some getting used to, but gives you much more precise control, and a smoother, gentler shave. It's also much cheaper. A good thing to remember is that if you have acne, you should never shave against the grain, as this is a major cause of irritation and ingrown hairs.\n\nJust be wary of the fact that most shaving soaps/creams contain fragrance, menthol, [essential oils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Essential_oils) or other irritants, which should all be avoided. To make matters more frustrating, many do not list ingredients online. Evidently, many people who make shaving products either know shit all about actual skin care, or just don't particularly care about sensitive skin (for which fragrance-free products are a must). There are some good suggestions for things to try in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/ly4mo/are_there_any_good_fragrancefree_shaving_soaps/).\n\n**Sun** \n\nSunscreen is important, and relevant here because skin that is healing from acne is highly susceptible to discolouration and damage that can cause it to age more quickly. This applies every day and all year round, not just in summer. Pretty much every really effective acne treatment increases sun sensitivity, including salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and even oral antibiotics (tetracyclines), so this is a particularly big deal for acne sufferers, and people who no longer have acne but want the redness left behind to heal.\n\nThis may seem straightforward enough, but for acne-prone skin, sunscreen is actually one of the hardest things to get right. Many of them are too thick to use on your face, and if you have sensitive skin, chemical sunscreens (i.e. the vast majority) can be problematic. In that case you would want a physical/mineral sunscreen, with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, but these are the most likely to block pores. Hopefully you won't have to rely on those. (Some of us are less lucky.) A spray or gel can be good for oily skin, but many of these are alcohol-based. What you most likely want is either a very light sunscreen, or a moisturiser with sunscreen that is made for oily skin.\n\nStaying out of the sun to avoid sun damage is also pretty good for your skin. That's right, there are benefits to being a forever alone shut-in spending all day on reddit! (UV rays pass through windows, though, so close your blinds.) Uh, just make sure you take a vitamin D supplement if you're going to do that. Actually, speaking of which...",

On the other hand, I feel like I have something to bring to light that you have left out.\n\nThere has been a decent amount of experimentation recently with lower-than-traditional doses of accutane.  We are learning that many people are able to substantially (or entirely) clear their skin with dosages less than half of what is normally prescribed.\n\nI, myself, am an example.  At 160 pounds, I would usually be prescribed anywhere from 35mg to 75mg per day (or even more).  However, I have achieved and maintained a clear face with no more than one pimple every couple of months by taking a single 20mg pill every other day (10mg daily dosage).\n\nThe true benefit to low dosages is not just the reduced cost, but the reduced side effects.  After all, the most common reason that I see people avoid accutane is because of these side effects.  Fortunately, with low dosages they are almost always very tolerable.  Personally, the only thing I have experienced is chapped lips.  I'll trade that for clear skin any day.\n\nThe actual dosage that's necessary seems to vary significantly from person to person.  I have seen even less than 5mg per day have a significant effect on some people.  I am not an expert on the product, but I don't see anything wrong with a person experimenting to find the lowest dosage that will work for them, instead of simply going full dosage or nothing.",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm a Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist (NSCA), FRC mobility specialist, brown belt under Caio Terra, and owner of [Victory Submission Strength](https://victorysubmissionstrength.com/)‚Äîa strength training facility for grapplers in San Jose, CA.\n\nYou can find me on several jiu jitsu podcasts, most notably [Elbows Tight](https://open.spotify.com/episode/32r6XLD8L8jZYtuUqFkvdT?si=13268b48c0a94508) and the [BJJ Fanatics podcast](https://youtu.be/0Js52igkNx0?si=-XctJjdDJm-pik1m).\n\nA common thread on this subreddit seems to be centered around asking for advice on the topic of strength training for jiu jitsu. I‚Äôll usually answer questions directly in the comments but I thought it might be helpful to compile pretty much everything I know about building strong, mobile, explosive grapplers in one central location. Hence: this post üòÑ\n\nIn any case, see below for an organized database, so to speak, on how to properly approach strength training for jiu jitsu whether your goal is simply to stay on the mats longer or to win a world championship. These principles work for everyone as we‚Äôve proven hundreds of times over.\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nPART 1\n\n1. Disclaimer & Guidelines\n2. Building a Program\n3. Overarching Structure\n   1. Breathwork and Foam Roll\n   2. Mobility\n   3. Pattern Practice\n   4. Core\n   5. Dynamic Warmup\n   6. Speed/Power\n   7. Strength\n   8. Conditioning\n\nPART 2\n\n1.

Tracking Progress\n9. Training Through Competition/Tapering\n10. What if I‚Äôm Injured?\n11. Final Thoughts\n\n**Disclaimer & Guidelines**\n\nBefore I start, there are some general guidelines and disclaimers to keep in mind:\n\n1. Injury prevention is not a thing. Injuries WILL happen regardless of your strength training regimen. More realistically we look to mitigate some injuries and build athletes up so if/when they do get injured, they bounce back quicker because their bodies are resilient as fuck.\n2. In order to maximize results, it‚Äôs helpful to get a movement screen done so you know exactly where your limitations and areas of opportunity are. This is something we do with EVERY SINGLE PERSON who walks through our doors so we know exactly where to start their custom program. I realize that most of the people reading this won‚Äôt have access to a comprehensive, professional movement screen so before you start anything do yourself a favor and follow along with this video: [\\[CARs Assessment\\]](https://youtu.be/smvY0hdPMrc) The CARs assessment is meant to highlight any aberrant joint function, discrepancies between left and right limbs, and otherwise prompt us to ask questions about someone‚Äôs history when any of that pops up be it injury or athletic history related. If you feel any closing angle pain (CAP) do NOT move through it! It WILL feel worse tomorrow. Simply go around it, and continue through the screen. Note what doesn‚Äôt feel good and then when it comes to building a program, be sure not to aggravate it by moving (especially explosively) into those range(s). If you can, find a physical therapist (preferably one familiar with FRC concepts) to help you out of that CAP.\n3. Training frequency will depend entirely on your life/BJJ schedule, so I can‚Äôt tell you exactly how many days or *when* (before or after) you should train on the mats/in the weight room. What I CAN tell you is that you‚Äôre only as good as your recovery, so if you‚Äôre strength training like a maniac 5x/week you are almost certainly going to burn out and/or hurt yourself. Most of our athletes (95% conservatively) train BJJ 4-6x/week and strength train 2x/week. When structured properly, THIS IS PLENTY. DO NOT LET ANYONE TELL YOU YOU NEED TO DO MORE. Remember, more isn‚Äôt always better. Better is better. I‚Äôve seen it a thousand times‚Äîsomeone comes in saying they want to train 4x/week. We start at 2x/week and sure enough a few months in they‚Äôre lifting heavier than they‚Äôve ever lifted, jumping higher than they‚Äôve ever jumped, have more time and energy for the things they love (jiu jitsu!), and are shocked at how little they *actually* have to do to get really great results.\n4. Lastly, we fit the exercise to the athlete NOT the other way around. There is no ‚Äúbest‚Äù exercise for BJJ. There is nothing that says you have to squat, deadlift, or bench press. If your body doesn‚Äôt agree with a particular exercise whether that‚Äôs due to bumps, bruises, prior injuries, or body dimensions‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have to do it. The key is understanding how to progress, regress, and lateralize exercises (more on that later) to best fit you and your body on that particular day.\n\n**Building a Program**\n\nOk so you‚Äôve done your movement assessment and everything checks out (or maybe it doesn‚Äôt and you have some things to work on, that‚Äôs ok). And you‚Äôve figured out how many days you want to/can lift. The next step is building a program. For simplicity‚Äôs sake all of the following examples will be based on a 2x/week split beginner program. Advanced lifters can progress or lateralize accordingly.\n\nThere are a few things to consider when doing this:\n\n1. Training age. Are you completely new to lifting? Or have you been lifting for several years? Newer lifters should generally start with simpler movements and lighter weights. The kettlebell deadlift is one such example. More seasoned lifters will likely be able to start with more complex exercises like the barbell or trap bar deadlift.\n2. Physiological age. Are you in your 20s? 30s? 40s? 50+? The older we get the more dangerous explosive movements get. For younger athletes we‚Äôll have them sprint, jump, hop, and bound. The older the athlete, the less likely we are to program the most explosive variations only because a ruptured Achilles tendon is simply not worth it in the long run. That‚Äôs not to say that older athletes shouldn‚Äôt include speed and power work‚Äîthey just have fewer options and need to be more careful about how they do them. One important caveat here is that someone who has never stopped training those qualities can and should continue to train them. We have a couple of 40+ year old athletes who played field sports and then just continued to train that way (sprinting, jumping, etc) after their retirement from competitive sports. They are still conditioned and enjoy doing those things so we‚Äôre ok with keeping them in their program.\n3. Athletic history. What sports did you play growing up, if any at all? Is BJJ your first foray into the world of athletics? Did you wrestle in high school and then decide to make the jump? This, again, will determine how ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù someone is in the weight room. People who played sports before BJJ are typically more athletically inclined than people who didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not to say you can‚Äôt develop athleticism! It just means your start point might be different and that‚Äôs ok.\n4. Training frequency. How often you can lift will dictate how much you can put into your program on any given day. Fewer lifts will mean you‚Äôll have to prioritize certain exercises over others. That being said, 2x/week is plenty in order to get every movement pattern you need done.\n\nAs an aside I also think every part of a program should have a clearly defined ‚Äúwhy‚Äù so you‚Äôll also see several ‚Äúhow does this apply to BJJ?‚Äù sections.\n\nIf you‚Äôre currently working with a coach, do they know *why* they‚Äôre making you do what you‚Äôre doing? Too often I see trainers slap random shit up on a whiteboard for the sake of novelty without actually reasoning through each and every piece. This is a huge red flag!\n\n**Overarching Structure**\n\nWe use a template that looks like this:\n\n[2 Day Template](https://preview.redd.it/2p041p70vm2c1.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=135cd6864bc06874e5cd03a9c320bd8538c1ee48)\n\nEach drop-down menu has dozens of exercises to choose from and are ordered from simplest to most complex so we can very easily progress/regress/lateralize people. Learning how to do this on the fly is a skill in and of itself. The more experience you have doing this stuff the easier it will become to decide that ‚Äúx exercise isn‚Äôt working for me today so I‚Äôll swap it for y instead.‚Äù All while maintaining the same training effect.\n\n**Breath Work and Foam Roll**\n\nYou can see we start with a quick breath work exercise and foam rolling. This is meant to do three things:\n\n1. De-stress the athlete. There‚Äôs only so much stress someone can handle, that goes for distress as well as eustress (good stress, like working out). We aim to lower stress levels first so we have more space to add the upcoming eustress.\n2. Move water through the system. Much of the soreness or tightness felt in your muscles is the result of what‚Äôs called *metabolic acidosis*, NOT lactic acid. Basically when your cells do work, they produce acidic waste, which leads to an unbalanced pH, and the ensuing soreness in your muscles. Foam rolling can help push water through the system, thus rebalancing the pH at the cellular level. Over time, that soreness will dissipate but if you‚Äôre just starting out, you‚Äôre likely in for a little bit of pain here.\n3. Create a routine. We are creatures of habit and if you foam roll consistently before you lift your body will adapt. It will ‚Äúknow‚Äù what‚Äôs coming more or less.\n\nNote: this might be one of the only times I tell people to move *toward* the pain. That being said, any more than a 7/10 is probably not the best for you so adjust position and pressure accordingly. Breathe through this. Imagine yourself melting around the roller. Let your body know that this is ok.\n\n[Follow along HERE.](https://youtu.be/xYhc1d7sIIk)\n\n**Mobility**\n\nWe will typically prescribe mobility work for anyone who a) presents with severely immobile joints and/or b) athletes who need a certain range of motion to participate in their sport without fear of getting hurt.\n\nYou see, human tissue breaks down when the force exerted upon it EXCEEDS its ability to absorb that force. This often occurs at the end range of motion for any particular joint. We‚Äôve all seen videos of people who try to fight out of an armbar only to see their elbow bending the wrong way shortly thereafter.\n\nFor the jiu jitsu athlete, who spends a great deal of time \\*at\\* and sometimes \\*beyond\\* the end range of motion: This is a critical component of the program.\n\nNow, I spent nearly 16 hours at the UFCPI studying and practicing FRC protocols so it would be impossible for me to sum all of that up in this tiny section of this otherwise massive post (especially since mobility interventions often require a trained eye to identify and prescribe). BUT, I can give you some broad strokes pointers so you can at the very least start your mobility practice. We don‚Äôt add ALL of what I‚Äôm about to list. We pinpoint an athlete‚Äôs needs and attack that area of opportunity.\n\n[**CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations)**](https://youtu.be/3HUfh9y5Yrc?si=UcGvp1NijRD7IdiE&t=295) [\\[Full CARs routine\\]](https://youtu.be/smvY0hdPMrc)\n\n**Do these daily.** It takes 5-10 minutes tops. Like brushing your teeth for your joints. You don‚Äôt brush your teeth because it‚Äôs fun and sexy. You brush them so your teeth don‚Äôt rot out of your head.\n\n[**PAILs/RAILs (Progressive/Regressive Angular Isometric Loading)**](https://youtu.be/3HUfh9y5Yrc?si=Q69trSh3gZOBJ23_&t=975)\n\nHelp to a) increase range of motion in the targeted joint and b) expose the joint to high levels of force \\*under control\\* that it‚Äôs not the first time when someone else forces you to go there.\n\n[**PRHs/PRLOs/Hovers (Passive Range Holds/Lift Offs/Hovers)**](https://youtu.be/3HUfh9y5Yrc?si=ZXU5q-OTknbEhbaZ&t=2252)\n\nHelp to a) improve control at the end range and b) bridge the gap between passive and active ranges of motion.\n\nPassive: where you can move with assistance (think using your hands to bring your knee to your chest).\n\nActive: where you can move without assistance (think using solely your hip flexors to pull your knee to your chest).\n\nIf you don‚Äôt know what to do, at the very least do your CARs here.\n\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list. These are just the most common ways we can intervene from a mobility perspective.\n\nHow does this apply to BJJ?\n\nMobility is your foundation. Your ability to get in and out of positions at will, to retain guard, to apply and fend off certain submissions.\n\n**Pattern Practice**\n\nThis section we typically reserve for athletes who come to us with very little experience and need extra practice grooving fundamental patterns like squats and hinges. Doesn‚Äôt have to be fancy but we might start a beginner with:\n\nDay 1\n\n* [BW Squat 1x5](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hjDI114KqsE)\n* [BW Split Squat 1x5ea](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/R4AB5TZLeQA)\n\nDay 2\n\n* [BW Lateral Squat 1x5ea](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/L74eItMI544)\n* [BW SLDL 1x5ea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTL1Zr181po)\n\nThe thought process here is that ‚Äúlittle hinges swing big doors.‚Äù Meaning just 5 reps a day at 2x/week ends up amounting to roughly 500 extra reps in a year. Those extra 500 reps will certainly groove a better movement pattern.\n\n**Core**\n\nWe put our core work before the dynamic warmup for a few reasons:\n\n1. Most of our core work is static in nature and therefore doesn‚Äôt need loads of warm up prior.\n2. They serve as a primer for the more explosive, dynamic effort speed and power blocks to come.\n3. The final strength blocks (1 and 2) are far less mentally taxing when they‚Äôre supersets as opposed to trisets.\n\nWhat constitutes core work?\n\n* Anti-extension\n* Anti-lateral flexion\n* Anti-rotation\n* Loaded carries\n* Chops/lifts\n* Get ups\n\nWhy do we prioritize these?\n\nThe core‚Äôs main function is to provide stability. This is particularly important during any explosive movement like a throw, sweep, or takedown in that if your core is weak, all the energy you create with your hips/legs will be lost on its way to your upper body and into your opponent.\n\nImagine trying to hit a baseball with a pool noodle. It wouldn‚Äôt work, would it? Your ability to hit the ball far is predicated on the stiffness of the bat AND by extension your core üëÄ\n\nThis is NOT to say that the spine shouldn‚Äôt move, don‚Äôt get it twisted. See above: CARs. It can and should move when we want/need it to. That time is just ***not*** during a heavy collar drag.\n\nWhat does this look like in practice? For a beginner:\n\nDay 1\n\n* [Front plank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b78ZBF1J0JI) (anti-extension)\n* [Anti-rotation press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEUML9jcPNo) (anti-rotation)\n\nDay 2\n\n* [Side plank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVFyBGbz6Q8) or [Copenhagen plank](https://youtu.be/khX9SaB0QEs?si=bwFuASUlITi5VTZz) (anti-lateral flexion)\n* [Two arm loaded carry](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o-sI6aOJRTU) (tri-planar)\n\nWant to know more about core exercises? Check out our blog article on them [HERE](https://victorysubmissionstrength.com/blog/the-best-core-exercises-for-jiu-jitsu-anti-core).\n\nHow does this apply to BJJ?\n\nIf you‚Äôre unable to properly create stiffness in your core as you‚Äôre attempting to manipulate your opponent‚Äôs body, you‚Äôre fighting a losing battle. Core strength and therefore stability is your ability to finish AND defend throws, takedowns, and sweeps.\n\n**Dynamic Warmup**\n\nThe warmup is so much more than simply elevating heart rate. We use this time to build a **more robust athletic profile**. People who move well here (meaning in all directions, using different limbs/patterns/rhythms) typically move well on the mats and in life.\n\nWhat we‚Äôre trying to accomplish:\n\n* Elevate heart rate\n* Raise core temperature\n* Increase blood flow to limbs\n* Improve rhythm, coordination, balance, and proprioception (fancy term for knowing where you are in the world)\n* Introduce/practice low level plyometric work\n* Challenge the central nervous system\n* Prepare the body for upcoming speed/power work\n\nHow we program it:\n\nWith a 2x/week split we will bias linear and lateral movement 1x/ea to make sure we cover all our bases.\n\nDay 1\n\n[Linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vnCJ1FVmtY&feature=youtu.be)\n\n* Knee hugs (10 yards)\n* Heel to butt (10 yards)\n* Linear crawl (10 yards)\n* Skips (20 yards)\n* High knee run (20 yards)\n* Straight leg high kicks (20 yards)\n* Straight leg skips (20 yards)\n* Backpedal (20 yards)\n* Backward run (20 yards)\n\nDay 2\n\n[Lateral](https://youtu.be/pKvMQehTdg8)\n\n* Leg cradles (10 yards)\n* Heel to butt w/hinge (10 yards)\n* Lateral crawl (10 yards ea right/left)\n* Lateral skips (20 yards ea right/left)\n* Lateral shuffle (20 yards ea right/left)\n* Carioca (20 yards ea right/left)\n\nDon‚Äôt make the mistake of skipping the warmup or just hitting the bike for 5 minutes while you‚Äôre on your phone. Again, small hinges swing big doors. Practice these movements and their derivatives consistently over the course of a year and you will notice a big difference in the way you move, feel, and perform.\n\nHow does this apply to BJJ?\n\nRhythm, coordination, balance, and proprioception (knowing where you are in the world) are all critical components of being able to pass AND execute techniques from the guard. The more complete an athlete, the better equipped they‚Äôll be to deal with the ever-dynamic circumstances of the sport.\n\n**Speed/Power**\n\nAs stated above physiological and training age will play big roles in how we program this block. Some people will frankly never progress further than box jumps and that‚Äôs ok! It‚Äôs all about finding something that challenges the athlete without putting them at risk for injury.\n\nThings to keep in mind as you build this block:\n\n1. Power is just strength with a time component. How fast can you express the strength you have?\n2. Often, less is more. Keep volume low and intensity high. Give yourself plenty of rest in between each set, each REP even. The point is not to get through the set as fast you can. The goal is to express the highest level of force in the shortest time on each repetition.\n3. We put this block after the warmup and before the strength stuff because it is explosive in nature. You should be fresh. We don‚Äôt want to wait until you‚Äôre tired to start going fast because you just won‚Äôt have it in you at that point to truly go as hard as you can.\n\nWhat do we program here?\n\n* Sprints (for eligible athletes only, see the disclaimer above for a more detailed explanation)\n   * Short distances: 10-20 yards\n   * Low volume: 2-3 sets 2-3 reps (TOTAL, not per set)\n   * Plenty of rest: 30-60s\n* [Bike sprints](https://youtube.com/shorts/SgV6wPaLLwQ)\n   * Short duration: 7-10s\n   * Low volume: 2-3 sets 2-3 reps (TOTAL, not per set)\n   * Plenty of rest: 60-90s\n* Medicine ball throws/slams/tosses\n   * 6-12 lbs\n   * Low volume: 2-3 sets 5-10 reps\n* Jumps/hops/bounds\n   * Low volume: 2-3 sets 5-10 reps\n   * Note:\n      * Jumps: take off on two feet, land on two feet\n      * Hops: take off one one foot, land on same foot\n      * Bounds: take off one one foot, land on the opposite foot.\n\nHow do we program it?\n\nDay 1\n\n* [10-20 yard sprint](https://youtube.com/shorts/9WCLKVucUDQ)\n* [Medicine ball chest pass](https://youtube.com/shorts/jO78zmTl9Fo)\n* [Box jump](https://youtube.com/shorts/hwW5QDYQtH8)\n\nDay 2\n\n* [10-20 yard sprint](https://youtube.com/shorts/9WCLKVucUDQ)\n* [Medicine ball rotational toss](https://youtube.com/shorts/B3cKg0uV3I4)\n* [Box hop](https://youtube.com/shorts/psq0Vr4ptHU)\n\nThere's obviously no sprinting in BJJ so you don‚Äôt need to get bogged down in trying to achieve perfect form. Ultimately what matters most (for all speed/power work) is the **intent**. That you‚Äôre truly trying to go as fast/as hard as you can is what will determine whether or not you see/feel results.\n\nHow does this apply to BJJ?\n\nSpeed and power are your ability to excel during scrambles, execute takedowns and throws, as well as jump on submissions. Each of those scenarios require a certain explosiveness and the above sections will help you develop it.\n\n**Strength**\n\nWhen it comes to programming for strength, we categorize movements as:\n\n* Hip dominant\n   * Bilateral\n   * Unilateral\n   * Hybrid\n* Knee dominant\n   * Bilateral\n   * Unilateral\n   * Hybrid\n* Push\n   * Bilateral\n   * Unilateral\n   * Horizontal\n   * Vertical\n   * Scap free\n   * Scap fixed\n* Pull\n   * Bilateral\n   * Unilateral\n   * Horizontal\n   * Vertical\n\nThere are several points to make here to help make sense of all this.\n\n1. The goal here is to pair non-competing movement patterns so that we can get more done in less time without missing anything. Example:\n   1. [Trap bar deadlift](https://youtu.be/Hd5tpd_sT88) (bilateral hip dominant)\n   2. [Push-up](https://youtube.com/shorts/6gO-9zb1xCc) (scap free, bilateral, horizontal push)\n   3. [Split squat](https://youtube.com/shorts/JYMVQKTYJuk) (unilateral knee dominant)\n   4. [Chin-up](https://youtube.com/shorts/vL60Sg4h23M) (bilateral vertical pull)\n2. Re: push movements‚Äîscap free exercises (those where the shoulder blade is free to move as intended) take priority over scap fixed (those where the shoulder blades are pinned back to form a sort of ‚Äúplate‚Äù on the back of the rib cage). Why? Because the shoulder blade‚Äôs main function is to provide stability and keep the shoulder on the socket by moving about the rib cage. In general, a shoulder blade that moves well means fewer shoulder problems later on. This isn‚Äôt to say that we won‚Äôt program the bench press or its derivatives, it‚Äôs that we feel athletes should fulfill certain prerequisites (good, healthy shoulder blade mobility) before doing so.\n3. Re: pull movements‚Äîwe typically program two horizontal pulls for every one vertical pull simply because the shoulder joint is one of if not the weakest in the human body and the overhead position is one of if not the most stressful on the shoulder joint.\n4. Re: push-pull ratios‚Äîyou‚Äôll see a lot of people say you should have one pull for every one push exercise but to be honest, jiu jitsu people are usually so hunched forward we program **three** pulls to every one push. Ultimately this is more of a case by case scenario and everyone is different but I can say that this ratio has served us well over the years.\n5. Bilateral vs. Unilateral‚Äîtwo limbs at a time vs. one limb. We program both, but place a heavy emphasis on unilateral lifts. Why? Because life happens one limb at a time. Unless you‚Äôre a powerlifter, you‚Äôre probably never pushing or pulling evenly on both arms or legs. Unilateral lifts are inherently more ‚Äúsport specific.‚Äù\n6. On a separate, but related note, the *orthopedic cost* of a unilateral movement is far lower than that of a bilateral one, meaning I can get the same training effect using **a quarter of the weight**. Example: if I weigh 200 pounds and I do a single leg squat with 100 pounds in external load (dumbbell, vest, chains, etc.) that‚Äôs the equivalent of performing a bilateral back squat with 400 pounds! This is a result of what‚Äôs called *bilateral deficit* which basically means there is a reduction in the amount of force from a single limb during maximal bilateral exercise. If I can get the same training effect using a quarter of the weight then I can keep people healthier and therefore on the mats getting better, longer.\n\nWhat does it look like in a typical program?\n\n**Day 1**\n\n**Strength 1**\n\n[Trap bar deadlift](https://youtu.be/Hd5tpd_sT88) (bilateral hip dominant)\n\n[Push-up](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6gO-9zb1xCc) (scap free, bilateral, horizontal push)\n\n**Strength 2**\n\n[Goblet split squat ](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JYMVQKTYJuk)(unilateral knee dominant)\n\n[Chin-up ](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vL60Sg4h23M)(bilateral vertical pull)\n\n**Day 2**\n\n**Strength 1**\n\n[Zercher squat](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9bdsXNPUO38) (bilateral knee dominant)\n\n[Inverted TRX row](https://youtube.com/shorts/Mtt5BEWe_2M) (bilateral horizontal pull)\n\n**Strength 2**\n\n[SLDL](https://youtube.com/shorts/cV0_fIpBYIk) (unilateral hip dominant)\n\n[One arm dumbbell row](https://youtube.com/shorts/GNAjdXgsHxY) (unilateral horizontal pull)\n\nHow does this apply to BJJ?\n\nWell, no one‚Äôs ever gotten injured because they were too strong. Also, the stronger you are the less energy required to execute a given task or technique. Less energy required means you‚Äôve got 1) a bigger gas tank and thus better match economy and 2) more time and space to *think* during a round.\n\nIt‚Äôs your ability to maintain a grip, maintain a position, off balance your opponent, and avoid getting swept, taken down, or submitted.\n\nTechnique obviously plays a **major** role in determining who wins or loses a match. BUT, if the level of technique is roughly the same, the stronger athlete typically wins. This is why we like to say that strength **AMPLIFIES** technique.\n\n**Conditioning**\n\nThis last block we‚Äôll program on a person to person basis.. people who train BJJ a lot typically don‚Äôt need more conditioning in my opinion. But, if we do program it I like [Joel Jameison](https://www.instagram.com/coachjoeljamieson/)‚Äôs Lactic Power Intervals protocol.\n\nIt can be any exercise as long as it‚Äôs maximal effort. I personally like the airdyne bike for this, but if running is your bag then by all means, do that.\n\n20s max effort\n\n90s rest\n\nRepeat 3x\n\nRest 8 minutes\n\nRepeat\n\nThe trouble with programming this after the lift is most athletes are typically smoked so they can‚Äôt really give max effort. So if we do program this, it‚Äôs usually on a separate day where they aren‚Äôt lifting.\n\nHow does this apply to BJJ?\n\nEnergy systems training should roughly mimic the demands of the sport and in the case of jiu jitsu you often find repeated, alternating bouts of explosive action and stopped positions where the heart rate rises and then falls only to rise again very quickly.\n\nClick [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/18443i9/the_definitive_guide_to_strength_training_for_bjj/) to go to Part 2!",

    "body": "The impact of COVID-19 extends to how people are searching online. I thought to measure what the impact caused by the global economic downturn is by tracking online searches.\n\nI analyzed what people in the US searched online in the past month and how their interest shifted week by week.\n\nIf people are searching for these things, it means there's demand and a market opportunity you might want to pursue.\n\n# What people are searching\n\nPeople went from searching for keywords related to protection (*sanitizers*, *anti-viral masks*, *immunity boosters*, etc) to searching keywords related to essentials (yes, *toilet paper* was searched a lot =).\n\nThen, they begin searching for DIY ways to make them (for example, keywords like *DIY masks*, *how to make shampoo at home* are still trending).\n\nLater on, with the quarantine, people started to be at home. We found that they were searching for ways to work better (everything related to *remote working*, or *smart working*) and ways to entertain themselves and their kids (for example, *board games, at-home workouts*, etc).\n\nNow, they are also searching for ways to stay in touch with their families (for example, keywords like *Zoom* or *Skype* are trending).\n\nThey are now also searching for medical devices that are portable and that they can use at home to monitor their health situation (for example, o*xymeters*).\n\n# Non-obvious trends\n\nAside, from the analysis above, here are some more non-obvious trends that are emerging:  \n\n\n1. **Loungewear üëï**\n\nBecause of COVID-19, people are self-isolating at home and they are looking forward to donning their finest loungewear for another Netflix binge-watch session on the sofa.\n\nLoungewear had an increment of over 90% in search interest in the last days and it's steadily growing.\n\n2. **Prepping üõÖ**\n\nPrepping often refers to the act of preparing yourself for life during and after an apocalyptic event. Basically, it means that you are ready to live unplugged from the system.\n\nIt has always been part of the *survival* niche, but now it's getting more and more attention even from non-believers because of the coronavirus emergency.\n\n3. **Composting for beginners** ‚ôªÔ∏è\n\nPeople are all about composting now. Why?\n\nMore and more cities are shutting down drop-off services because of the urgent steps required to bend the curve on coronavirus transmissions, like social distancing.\n\nThese drop-off services include food scrap drop-off, household hazardous waste drop-off, compost giveback, electronics recycling, and textile donations and recycling.\n\n4. **Gardening** üå∑\n\nThere's a growing interest in gardening, which is also obviously related to composting. Check out keywords like *gardening*, *gardening for beginners*, *garden beds, raised garden beds.*\n\n5. **Barbell weight set üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**\n\nWith more and more people at home, gym equipment is getting a ton of interest. Barbell weight set registered a +22% increment this month!\n\nAlso look keywords like *weight plates*, *resistance bands*, *dumbells,* *home gym*, *no equipment workout*, *p90x*, *peloton*.\n\nAside from this, solitary fitness activities are also trending upward. For example, look at *hiking*.\n\n6. **Online will üìù**\n\nKeywords like \"*how to make a will online*\" are getting demand, as *online will* in general. With COVID-19, people are eager to put their things in order, just in case.\n\n7. **Calming care üê∂**\n\nNot related to corona, but in the pet category, I would get in the game of selling everything anxiety related. For example, the demand for *dog calming care* has been growing steadily over the last 5 years. It could be related to two types of anxiety: from separation, but also from fireworks.\n\n8. **iRacing Setups, Adult coloring books, Puzzles, Board games üèé**\n\nPeople are at home, and they want to play. All of the above are great activities for leisure.\n\n9. **CVC Words, Directed drawing üë∂üèª**\n\nSchools are closed, kids are at home. That means that parents are probably home-schooling them now. Interest in everything related to home-schooling is getting traction.\n\n10. **Dalgona Coffee ‚òïÔ∏è**\n\n*Dalgona coffee* is the trend in coffee right now. I don't personally know what the hype is about, but it's a whipped drink made with coffee, sugar and chilled milk.\n\n11. **Canned wine üç∑**\n\nOk, last one - in the food & nutrition space: *canned wine*. Being an Italian, I'd never sell such a thing, but hey, demand has been growing a lot.\n\n12. **Virtual pranks ü§™**\n\nWith more people working from home remotely, virtual pranks are also trending right now. Check out keywords like *zoom pranks*, *zoom bombing*.\n\n13. **Milk baths** üõÅ\n\nNot a corona trend, a *milk bath* is a bath taken in milk instead of water. Often other scents such as honey, rose, daisies and essential oils are added. Milk baths use lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, to dissolve the proteins which hold together dead skin cells. It has been steadily growing in the past 5 years.\n\nYou heard about these trends here first! =)\n\n# Feedback wanted\n\nI hope this analysis buys me a little goodwill in order to ask you for feedback on my [startup that does trends analysis](https://treendly.com).   \n\n\nDo you like the way we are presenting data? I'm afraid people are overwhelmed from the amount of data we display.\n\nThanks,  \nMike",

If the goal was text for SEO, alright, if not, there's room for improvement. :)\n\nRandom idea that came to me, that bubble image you have there next to the founder letter, it could pop on hover or click.

    "body": "Hey guys! First post here.\nLittle background: I'm a Biology/Chem major at my college as well as a gymrat.\n\nI worked at a local crab shack last summer. On my second day of the job I had a table of 4 come in; easy money. All four of them were really nice in the beginning, social and even remembered my name. The man who sat closest to me, when I came to get the drink order, said: \"wow man, do you workout?\" I told him I did, for a few years. Anyway, I get the drinks to them and they're taking their time picking out their food. No problem, I don't have any other tables. Ten or so minutes go by and we start to get packed (lunch rush.) I go back again and they decide to get four orders of our \"all you can eat\" crab special and some appetizers. I rush back to put the order in, since they've been waiting so long, and the rest is out of my hands.\n\nAs I mentioned before, we started to get packed, food was carried back and forth like a conveyor belt. I heard my name called and I went to get the apps. I look: no apps. Instead, it's the 4 orders of crabs. \n \nApparently someone stole my apps. I take the crabs out to the table and explain the situation. I reassured them that the appetizers would probably take only five minutes to prepare. They seemed a little confused but otherwise happy to know the apps will be out soon, except the mirin' guy from the beginning; he was not having it. He explained to me that he can't possibly eat his entree knowing appetizers are going to show up, that the whole point of the appetizer is to come before the meal. I again explained how when restaurants get packed there's a higher chance mistakes will happen and that I'd get the apps out as soon as I can. He responds by saying it doesn't seem like I tried to bring their food out in order, how could someone possibly steal food meant for them? He \"dismisses me\" and, 'lo and behold the apps are ready to be taken over.\n\n I come back and drop them off, mirin' man explains he wants to speak to my manager. I ask why and he says the crabs are \"mucked\" meaning that they've been steamed too many times. Which, our whole staff knows is bullshit, we take pride in only steaming crabs once. I bring over my manager and overhear that they demand a 15%-20% discount. We, being a newly opened restaurant and trying to get a good name with locals, reluctantly obliged. I bring the people their check and apologize again. The man tells me that my service was great and he knows I couldn't control what happened (oh sweet, I may actually make a tip.) \n \nIn a performance I have never seen before, he takes out a bill from his pocket and hands it to me, responding: and there's your tip! For a $95 total bill he gave me 5 dollars. I tried not to show any sign of disbelief and before I could even respond with a thank you he spouts out: like I said your service was great, I just can't reasonably support a business that sells bad food.\n\nOkay, whatever. You know, one bad table and they're gone. It's fine. \n\nI go to clean off the table and the man comes back to me. I can only imagine he's going to ask for his dollar back. He explains: \"look man, the reason I asked if you lift is because I'm selling this product for athletes. It's this new-age stuff, completely removes lactic acid from your body. All those harmful chemicals? Completely expelled. I have samples in my truck and I was wondering if you'd want to sponsor us, I'd just need a small deposit so I can keep buying the supplement.\" \nLike I said before: I lift, but, I'm nowhere near professional level where a supplement company would want to be sponsoring me. A lot of snake oil companies, however, like to take advantage of young lifters. \n\nI ask him \"really? It takes out harmful chemicals? What does it have in it?\"\n\n\"Oh the usual stuff but with the right concentrations: BCAA's, Beta-alanine, maltodextrin\"\n\nI respond: \"And Delta Calberins right?\"\n\n\"Yeah! That's one of the hidden ingredients that separates us from the rest.\" He said.\n\nMy eye twitches a little, \"Right, well that's not a real thing. Good luck selling your product, if you don't mind I have to make up the 5 dollar tip I received from a previous table.\"\n\nTo this day I look back and get a little bit of a justice boner.\n\nTL;DR: dude gives me bad tip, tries to sell me bullshit supplement, I tell him off, justice boner.",

    "body": "___________________\n\n\n\n  They are coming again now, stumbling out of the sulphurous night with their demented grins and their glowing eyes. Lystra is a hive world, populated by billions. Contact has been lost with most of it, indicating that the majority have been turned or are turning, and so the crowds are endless.\n\n  Brother Sarrien does not use his bolter. The last ammunition for it ran out three weeks ago. He fights on the walls with his power sword and his gauntlets, slaying like a warrior-king of his old home world. His limbs are heavy and flooded with lactic acid, and it feels like powering through deep water.\n\n  He is positioned at the jutting salient of a long, south-facing bastion. This is manned by the hastily amalgamated regiments of the surviving Lystran Proximal Guard, who are exhausted down to their marrow. Far off, chem-works are burning, making the horizon smoulder and the freezing air taste like gall. The spires at their backs glow with a million points of fading, flickering light.\n\n  He chants as he fights. If he were fighting with his own squad he would have been roaring war cries or calling out tactical movements, creating the auditory hell that daunts the enemy and propels his battle-brothers to greater feats, but his battle-brothers are all far away with their own contests, and so he chants now, in the manner of a Chaplain, to inspire the Guard.\n\n  ‚Äò*Stand fast, for Him on the Throne!*‚Äô he shouts, smashing his fist through the neck of a grasping stumbler.\n\n  That is the word they use to describe them: ‚Äòstumblers‚Äô. The euphemism hides the horror of it. It says nothing of their rictus faces and their awkward splayed limbs, their grey flesh hanging from yellow bones and the hot glow behind their bloodshot eyes. They are climbing up the high walls now, hoisting themselves atop piles of their own dead, limping blindly into the path of lascannon stations. Once they crest the parapet‚Äôs edge they start killing, grinning the whole time.\n\n  ‚Äò*Remember your vows!*‚Äô Sarrien chants, swinging the bloodied stump of one stumbler-corpse into another, sending both sailing over the edge. ‚Äò*Endure! Remain steadfast!*‚Äô\n\n  The defenders would have collapsed by now, if he had not been there to keep them fighting. They are staring into the twisted faces of those that were once men and women. Perhaps, every so often, they come up against those they knew, and have to cut them down. Killing one of them is not difficult, for they make no effort to evade the las-fire. Killing hundreds is back-breaking, and every time a mistake is made and one gets through the gap, then the slaughter is prodigious.\n\n  ‚Äò*Keep on your feet!*‚Äô Sarrien shouts, breaking the spine of a stumbler, kicking out to upend another, slicing his blade around to take out two more. His hearts are thudding out of sequence ‚Äì they are becoming dangerously swollen. He is perspiring too much despite his dehydration. His hands are bleeding freely within his armour ‚Äì the product of fighting the long retreat for weeks without respite. ‚Äò*Stay firm! Endure!*‚Äô\n\n  The world of Lystra will fall. Distant minds on peaceful worlds have determined that it is worth the sacrifice of a single squad of Imperial Talons to keep Lystra out of the enemy‚Äôs hands for another month or two, perhaps longer.\n\n  For now, the defenders respond to his injunction. The walls are held. The lascannon turrets spit metronomically into the seething dark. Lystra Primaris remains inviolate, an island of purity within the gloom.\n\n  But they keep coming, more and more of them. Their deranged smiles become maddening to witness.\n\n  He hates them. He hates what they are doing to him. He hates that he will be ended by one of them ‚Äì a foe without honour or stature ‚Äì and not some champion worthy of his attention.\n\n  Sarrien‚Äôs voice becomes hoarse.\n\n  ‚Äò*Remember your vows!*‚Äô he cries again.\n\n___________________________________\n\n  He has been alone for a long time now. The rest of his battle-brothers are dead, their gene-seed lost to this rabble-world.\n\n  That angers him more than anything else. For Sarrien, for all of them, that is the sacred part, the thread that binds the Chapter to itself and to its distant progenitor. An individual brother might die, the spark of his life might be ended, and that is accepted. But to have the immortal remnant lost‚Ä¶ that is infuriating. They have saved so little of it during this wearying campaign, and there is no guarantee that the last gunship will even make it back to safety.\n\n  It feels futile. It feels like a decision has been made by tacticians a long way away, with no understanding of what priceless assets they are allowing to be cast into the wind. Does it really matter that Lystra stands for another month? What was the purpose of that order ‚Äì to genuinely buy time for other, more strategic conflicts, or to burnish the ledgers of some scholar in a strategium on Terra?\n\n  The southern walls of the city are overrun. They are fighting street to street now, making the stumblers suffer for every spire-crown they swarm through. They are beset by eruptions of plague at their backs, as well as the hordes closing in on them from the front. What is left of the Proximal regiment comes with Sarrien on his long retreat, and together they bolster what they can.\n\n  He speaks to Lieutenant Voorn, the most senior soldier remaining in his segment of the city.\n\n  ‚Äò*You had word of incoming relief forces,*‚Äô Sarrien says. ‚Äò*Before the long-range comm-net went down.*‚Äô\n\n  ‚Äò*I did.*‚Äô Voorn used to treat Sarrien with a kind of awestruck timidity. Now, like all of them, he is too damned tired for anything but grey-faced mumbling. ‚Äò*Nothing further.*‚Äô\n\n  That is that, then. The brief hope that the sector authorities had managed to scrape together reinforcements proves as illusory as every other half-glimpsed snatch of redemption. Perhaps nothing was ever sent. Perhaps something was, and it never made it.\n\n_________________________________\n\n The last lines are broken. He gave the order himself for Votive IX to evacuate with the last of the sacred weapons and scarce vials of recovered gene-seed, but has no idea if the command made it through in time.\n\n  He has been fighting without any kind of pause for longer than he can remember. One leg is broken, and splinters of bone graze up against his armour cabling. He is nearly blind from the blood pouring down his forehead. His powerblade has finally extinguished, its energy unit smashed, and now he wields it like the mute blades of antiquity.\n\n  He is backing away from the hordes, slashing in weary, two-handed curves. All he can see is the ocean of corrupted humanity sweeping towards him, every one with that damnable grin on their stretched faces. The air is hot, dry and caustic.\n\n  ‚Äò*For the Emperor!*‚Äô he cries out for the thousandth time that day, in defiance, his voice weak and liquid through a blood-filled throat.\n\n  Flies have got in through the rents in his armour, and they burrow into his flesh, snapping and sucking. Foul gases burst up from the ground beneath him, lurid greens and yellows, old toxins now released into an already putrid atmosphere.\n\n  He is the last. He has watched all the others die, one by one, selling themselves for a world the Imperium has clearly forgotten. He has no idea if their sacrifice bought time for victories elsewhere, and no longer cares. He cannot remember his own name, nor the chants given him by the Chaplains. He can only remember how to fight, and those three words ‚Äì For the Emperor ‚Äì that have burst from his lips since before his ascension to the Chapter itself.\n\n  A flayed canine horror bounds towards him, its mouth open to expose concentric rings of curved teeth, and he wearily hacks it down. He is aware that stumblers are clambering in the scaffold above him, coiled ready to pounce, and can do nothing about it.\n\n  For the first time, despair rises to choke him. There is nothing noble to fight here, nothing to test himself against, just this hateful, hateful swell of twisted and destroyed flesh.\n\n  ‚Äò*For the Emperor,*‚Äô he gasps, his body flaring with agony.\n\n  He staggers into a cavernous interior of a roofless cathedral, pursued all the way. A great stone aquila hangs from a broken archway, still suspended by corrosion-eaten chains. He fights his way towards it, panting, limping, feeling the insects burrow deeper into his skin. They get into his helm, suffocating him.\n\n  ‚Äò*For. The. Emperor.*‚Äô\n\n  Just as he draws closer, a blunt blade chops out his good leg from under him, and he stumbles. He hacks the blade‚Äôs bearer apart, but has to crawl now. The aquila is swaying, rocked by hot plague-winds gusting along the nave. \n\n  ‚Äò*For. The‚Ä¶*‚Äô\n\n  No breaths will come now. Every time he tries, more blowflies clog his throat.\n\n  ‚Äò*For‚Ä¶*‚Äô\n\n  He looks up. High above him, hidden behind a haze of dust and insects, a heavyset tattooed man is there. A livid weal runs along his flabby neck.\n\n  ‚Äò*That‚Äôs enough now, lad,*‚Äô the man says, ‚Äò*don‚Äôt you think?*‚Äô\n\n  ‚Äò*For‚Ä¶*‚Äô\n\n  Sarrien is trembling all over. He can feel his body giving up. His organs are full, pulsing as if worms might burst from them. His sword drops from his trembling fingers.\n\n  ‚Äò*You want to keep fighting, do you not?*‚Äô the man asks.\n\n  He struggles. All is going black.\n\n  ‚Äò*There‚Äôs a better death for you. If you want it. You won‚Äôt even remember you were here.*‚Äô\n\n  His head cracks to the ground, and he feels the weight of the stumblers as they land on him. Lice swarm up into his carapace, lodging deep within the interface nodes. His secondary heart bursts, and he feels the hot, wet pain within him.\n\n  He manages to look up, one last time. The tattooed man has come closer, and is squatting over him. There‚Äôs a strange breaking of the light over his green-eyed, bloodshot face.\n\n  ‚Äò*So what do you want now, lad?*‚Äô the man asks.\n\n  It seems as if it is just the two of them. He can still see the man‚Äôs features, but the rest is a blur. He can still feel the pain of his body‚Äôs disintegration, but the shrieks of the stumblers are muffled. The world shrinks around him like gauze over a wound.\n\n  ‚Äò*Resist,*‚Äô Sarrien croaks, though his voice is coming from a long way off.\n\n  ‚Äò*You could do.*‚Äô The face looms. It has an unhealthy pallor up close, grey-green like moss on stone. ‚Äò*You have done for months. You never broke. But then, you can resist anything, can‚Äôt you? Except, perhaps, pointlessness. This has all been pointless. That is the real torture.*‚Äô\n\n  Sarrien feels the words penetrate like fingernails. Something within him uncurls, a tumour or a blight, flexing into birth. He sees the iron ingots on the man‚Äôs shaven head, and they look like elongated service studs. He sees the lumps under the man‚Äôs skin, and they look like the ancient, decayed remnants of a black carapace.\n\n He has been fighting for so long. He has forgotten so much. The pain is unbearable. He knows nothing. He has been destroyed. All around him, the city is becoming a shrine. All it lacks is an offering.\n\n  ‚Äò*What do you want?*‚Äô the tattooed man asks again.\n\n  Sarrien looks up at him.\n\n  ‚Äò*To keep going,*‚Äô he says.\n\n\n_________________\n\nEdit | Synposis: \n\n>!

I am a medical doctor currently in residency training in the field of pathology. It's my job to study and categorize all sorts of human disease, usually by studying the effect it has on the human body and particularly its cells. Hataraku Saibou is a series written by Akane Shimizu featuring anthropomorphized human cells battling such disease. The creators seem to have a strong penchant for both accuracy and subtle detail, so I am here to help provide an explanation of and background information for each episode so you won't miss anything obscure. Call me Dr. Eightball. **Spoilers follow!**\n\nWhat's that? A double-header? Yes, now that the season has completed its run I would rather do this 2-episode arc in one shot. There's a lot to talk about, so let's get straight to it.\n\n# Character Highlight\n\n**Mast cell + Dendritic cell**\n\n[Center](https://preview.redd.it/of4q92qixgp11.png?width=3012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4a8e5b3d922441ef15f427452b38ca062a73cfa)\n\nSince there are more episodes than cast members, we have to cut our losses and drop a few characters. Memory cells probably do not need special mention; they are mature B- or T-lymphocytes that remain in the body following the resolution of an immune stimulus. Their role is to quickly mount a response to a repeat antigen, without having to go through all of the activation and clonal expansion in a naive response. Monocytes, we have already touched on somewhat. They are circulating myeloid cells that differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells once they arrive at their tissue destination\n\nSo let's talk about mast cells. To jog your memory, Mast cells reside in various tissues and are very similar in morphology & function to basophils (but derive from different precursor cells). Both play a role in inflammatory responses through degranulation especially in response to a specific antibody, IgE. We know them mostly for their contribution to allergic reactions, as that degranulation process releases cytokines like *histamine*, which 'loosens' the vascular endothelium that lines capillaries, allowing fluid (and immune cells!) to transmigrate more easily. They seem to also play some more specialized role in the brain, but this is minor and the research is still ongoing. Their role may strike you as narrow...which is probably why we haven't seen her again since the allergy episode. Her character design is pretty cute, but her functioning is depicted in a more sterile fashion than reality would deem--imagine her being coated by IgE by B-cells, and then having that IgE recognize a foreign antigen and her literally exploding into a soup of cytokines.\n\nNext, Dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are named for their long tendril-like processes (dendrites). Their chief role is to function as an *Antigen-presenting cell* (APC); to collect antigens and present them to immune cells (particularly lymphocytes) in order to stimulate the adaptive immune response. Many other cells can serve in this role (macrophages, other lymphocytes), but dendritic cells are especially suited for the job. Though they normally reside in tissues (see below), they migrate to lymph nodes or follicular centers to present those antigens to the lymphocytes there. They are depicted largely in a supportive role, which is accurate, and his character design has many arboreal features, likely to emphasize their complex branching morphology.\n\n[Immunohistochemical staining for S-100.  This is skin; the \\\\\"brown\\\\\" cells are dendritic cells, sitting mostly in the epidermis.](https://preview.redd.it/vzmn4ztbzgp11.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=d65ff204dc738ea1b00d92e79309b531ebf59c9f)\n\n# Episode 12 - Hemorrhagic shock (pt. 1)\n\n3:00 - We resume with AE-3803 somewhere in the pulmonary circulation picking up oxygen. I am curious what the festival stands are meant to represent here, and why the red cells are stopping to interact with them. They mostly look like food stands; recall that red blood cells normally passively consume glucose dissolved in plasma.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prynptht0hp11.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=467df7e56b27621fa6e2f3746aae21a2432ca451\n\n3:30 - Seems AE-3803 is being assigned to guide a newbie. Recall that red blood cells have a circulating lifespan of approximately 120 days and need to be constantly replenished. New red blood cells that enter circulation are known as \"reticulocytes\", and they should make up approximately 1% of your red blood cells under normal conditions.\n\n5:00 - Ooh, six functions of circulation Let's examine them. 1) Retaining moisture - Sure. Most body water content is locked within cells but your circulating volume is the most highly exchanged. 2) Exchanging gases - Yes, this is the #1 function of red cells. 3) Transporting nutrients - Although the red cells are often depicted carrying picnic baskets of nutrients and such, nutrients are actually not often red-cell bound and instead are directly dissolved in plasma or attached to soluble proteins (see: lipoproteins). Newbie seems aware of this. 4) Regulating body temperature - We touched on this last episode. In the heat, your skin vessels dilated to increase heat exchange with the environment. In the cold, your skin vessels contract to prevent this. 5) Protecting the body - IE, delivering immune cells. 6) Repairing wounds - IE, delivering platelets and immune cells. I would add 7) Acid-base homeostasis and 8) Delivery of hormones which are transported in circulation.\n\n6:30 - They are mobbed away from a lymphatic channel. Reminder that lymphatics drain the interstitial space, and a red cell normally shouldn't even have access to them (tissue trauma notwithstanding).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nh85dqxh2hp11.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e299f8f5d9a00ed7b283cc6be9266529ac6b7c\n\n7:10 - Oh, we are given the name of a minor cameo bug for once. Strep mutans, as the subtitles suggests, is a minor member of the streptococcus family. They are not especially virulent, but since they are present in the oral cavity, things like dental procedures can displace some into circulation. In rare cases they can form vegetations on heart valves (*Endocarditis*) which can be life threatening, but this usually only happens in people with abnormal valves.\n\n8:30 - U-1446 is giving us a lecture...seems like there is a lot of recap in this episode. Probably appropriate for a finale arc? Idk what's the deal with the blood splatter and washing thing. Probably nothing.\n\n10:00 - What an impatient stromal or epithelial cell. Maybe it's a highly metabolically active one, like the cells of the adrenal medulla, or retinal pigment epithelium. Different tissues need oxygen at different rates depending on their baseline metabolism. This also means that certain organs and tissues can tolerate hypoxic injury better than others. Generally, 5-8 minutes without oxygen (or circulation) at room temperature is the limit, as the central nervous system dies at that point.\n\n10:25 - Is there a name for this character archetype of the extremely shy yet badass femme?\n\n11:50 - They bust into the spleen again. Remember, this is where senescent red cells go to \"die\", or be removed from circulation by the splenic macrophages.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ajc3ojhc4hp11.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f022ed10560140b93ab6ad310ff3afb5f4cd14b\n\n12:10 - \"Transmitters\" probably refers to signaling molecules; that might refer to hormones or maybe neurotransmitters. Perhaps we're in an endocrine organ like the pituitary, or at a synaptic ganglion somewhere.\n\n15:00 - Some kind of massive catastrophy occurs. An acute nature like that, with massive tissue disruption, probably represents trauma. Trauma can be outright lethal in extreme cases (evisceration, decapitation), but death due to trauma usually results due to *exsanguination*, or bleeding.\n\n16:10 - An order is issued for blood cells to return to the center of the body. When there is massive loss of intravascular volume, blood vessels constrict in order to direct flow of blood towards crucial organs (CNS, heart, lungs), as the expense of organs like the GI tract and kidneys. This is facilitated partly by reflexes in the blood vessels, but also neurohormonal signaling (sympathetic nervous system, \"fight or flight\" response). There is a spike in blood pressure because of this vascular contraction, and this is advantageous to survival. If blood pressure drops too low, red cells cannot reach their target organs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/an2p2ho46hp11.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c8db3011ad2f715456cfa5609adbfa50b130ad\n\n17:20 - I'm not sure who the suits are. Maybe some cells in the hindbrain/brainstem which regulate core functions.\n\n17:55 - Ah, the tissue damage is near the head. This actually strikes me as pretty weird, given that the episode is about hemorrhagic shock. We can split bleeding into *internal* and *external*. Either can be lethal, but internal bleeding is generally limited by the size of the space that is being bled into. Only a few sites can accommodate a large enough bleed to be lethal, and the head is not one. Either the bleeding is external (eg, vessels of the neck are damaged), or we are going to shortly get a lesson on intracranial hematomas, which is a complex and dangerous topic.\n\n19:10 - AE-3803 notes the blood flow is faster than normal. This is a physiologic response to hemorrhage. As your intravascular volume depletes, the amount of blood pumped by the heart per beat (stroke volume) decreases. In order to maintain a normal cardiac output (in adults, 5L/min), the heart rate must increase. This is regulated intrinsically by the heart, which responds to the amount of blood returning from venous circulation. What other protective mechanisms kick in? The kidneys and adrenal glands both work to hormonally constrict vessels. The pituitary gland produces vasopressin to reduce fluid lost to urine production. I do not know why sweating is increasing, but this is a symptom of shock. It seems counterintuitive, doesn't it?\n\n20:20 - Any tissue damage can introduce pathogens. However, in the acute hemorrhagic setting, controlling infection is not priority number one. Death from bleeding out can takes minutes, whereas death from subsequent infection would take days. Still, we need to see all our crew in action, right?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3anlg7ym8hp11.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=d35ae50d719f838eddd2ae068c7e882a2711abac\n\n21:30 - This is the first time we have seen or implied that cells can be lost or die. In truth, it happens all the time.\n\n# Episode 13 - Hemorrhagic shock (pt. 2)\n\nA side note. Shock can be caused by many processes, not just bleeding out. Neurogenic shock can result due to brain trauma that causes dysregulation of blood flow. Anaphylactic shock causes dangerous vasodilation. Septic shock results form bacterial toxins that also affect blood flow. In any of these cases, organs suffer damage from lack of nutrient/oxygen supply (*multi-organ dysfunction syndrome*). A simple fact of life is that most people die from this process, whether the inciting cause is a malignant cancer or a hospital acquired infection. It is true of 100% of the adult autopsies I have performed.\n\n3:50 - We have confirmed that red cells have been lost to bleeding. Interestingly, we are not currently seeing a constant stream of them being sucked out. As the vessels are clamping down to preserve flow to crucial organs, peripheral sites indeed suffer hypoxic damage. If the source of bleeding is not controlled, and the blood volume continues to dwindle, eventually perfusion will be insufficient to support life.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lvf8a56kahp11.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01e4e857699bfb163633e39858b377ca3390e94\n\n5:00 - When cells become hypoxic, they secrete factors to promote blood flow to themselves; things like nitrous oxide which causes vasodilation. If the oxygen supply is not sufficient to support oxidative metabolism (the primary, preferred, and more efficient means of forming energy), they will convert to anaerobic metabolism, producing lactic acid in the process. This lactate can cause systemic acidosis and is often used as a laboratory measure of tissue hypoxia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fwmcctdbhp11.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=92d14d5f96458481b21b9210ee51facfd7444af6\n\n6:10 - Hyperventilation sets in partly in response to the acidosis and due to other systemic responses. This is helpful in some cases, and some shock patients benefit from being given supplemental 100% oxygen (unclear if that is the case here), but the problem in hemorrhagic shock is an inability to transport oxygen in circulation. Reduced red cell mass, means less oxygen supply. Right now the bone marrow should be kicking in as hard as possible to push out more reticulocytes, but it is not fast enough to be of much help in the acute setting.\n\n7:00 - Our heroes are hard at work delivering what oxygen they can. You may be wondering how much blood was lost. Shock is divided into [four categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)) depending on the volume lost, with characteristic physiologic responses to each. As you can see, loss of >40% of the blood volume (around 2L) is life-threatening and requires intervention. Loss of <15% is completely tolerable (and is approximately what happens when you donate whole blood). Severe trauma patients may require transfusion with several times their entire blood volume before the bleeding can be stopped (*massive transfusion*).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q33perv9chp11.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=72f9eb1dc3298439ebed8ae9306f030f23c102d9\n\n8:00 - The vessels are damaged around the wounds. As tissue hypoxia takes hold, new vessels are formed (*angiogenesis*) in an attempt to restore circulation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gmqsuyschp11.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=fae9305ef5847143bd0c4ba2283ee50915308e13\n\n10:00 - Increased perfusion to a bleeding site will increase the rate of blood loss. In actuality, vessels that are damaged have reflex mechanisms to try and snap shut entirely to mitigate this blood loss, even in the face of a systemic sympathetic vasoconstrictive response. Allow my physiology textbook to explain:\n\n>The circulatory system can recover as long as the degree of hemorrhage is no greater than a certain critical amount. Crossing this critical threshold by even a few milliliters of blood loss makes the eventual difference between life and death. Thus, hemorrhage beyond a certain critical level causes shock to become *progressive.* That is, *the shock itself causes still more shock*, and the condition becomes a vicious circle that eventually leads to deterioration or the circulation and to death.\n\nEventually, the heart will not receive enough blood through its coronaries to fuel the pumping myocardium. Vasomotor failure sets in, causing critical end-organ failure. Blood in small vessels becomes sludged. Tissue becomes ischemic and eventually necrotic, releasing toxins that cause blood vessel dilation, worsening shock further. Massive acidosis sets in, and organs sequentially fail. When the failure becomes too severe, the shock is *irreversible*, and even aggressive resuscitation will not restore their function. And yes, hypothermia sets in as well.\n\nSo, what can you do?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k68htz0sehp11.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1d74dd6ec2f0e67e140e49129126d65a5d8f091\n\n15:15 - If the blood is lost, it can be replaced. Cue a red cell transfusion. Blood products can be collected from donors of the right compatibility and *transfused* to replace missing blood components. These red cell's different outfits and accents give away their foreign origin.\n\nA few points to consider: Blood transfusion is absolutely key in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock. However, it generally would not be the first step. We would start with *fluid resuscitation*, administration of IV fluids like saline or lactated ringers as we saw in the heat stroke episode. It's possible that was happening, but it was not being depicted. It is easier and faster to immediately hang a bag of fluid, which is still helpful in restoring the intravascular volume even if it does not have oxygen-carrying capacity. Meanwhile, a lab test (a *type and screen*) would need to be sent to evaluate what types of blood will be compatible. If that process cannot wait, emergency blood (of type O+ or O-) should be available in every emergency department.\n\n18:00 - A brief summary of whole blood donation: A phlebotomist places an IV line and draws off \\~500mL of whole blood into a bag containing an anticoagulant solution. This blood is spun down and split into red cells and plasma (which may or may not be processed further). The red cells can be kept in chilled conditions for several weeks. Samples are drawn off for infectious disese and compatibility testing. Once cleared, the cells are available for administration. Typical uses include trauma cases such as in this episode, in patients with hematopoietic malignancies who cannot produce their own red cells, and in patients with defective red cells (hemoglobinopathies, thalassemias).\n\n# Summary\n\nA fitting end to a series with an arc that returns us to the crucial role of the red blood cell. This is the first time our protagonist was truly the hero. And also the most severe clinical scenario yet encountered.\n\nI wanted to thank everyone for reading and commenting. This has been a very fun and educational little diversion. I actually have some news since we started doing this back in June/July. Since I have started the respective rotations, I have decided to pursue dual fellowships in hematopathology (blood cancers) and transfusion medicine (blood banking). One wonders if this series played any sort of role, lol. But with that in mind, let me soapbox a bit:\n\nAny civilized healthcare infrastructure depends on altruistic blood donors to render effective patient care. 99% of people are able to donate blood, but fewer than 5% do. Please consider taking time to donate blood and help save a life. Look up your regional blood donation center--in Asia and the EU, there are national donor registries. In the United States, look to the American Red Cross or to your local hospital blood bank (try the [AABB](http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx)).\n\nThanks all for reading.\n\n# References\n\n>Abbas, Abul K., Andrew H.

I do wonder if the body had whole damage, seeing that it affected almost all parts. Also, Red Blood Cells cannot carry more than 4 at a time, right?\n\nInteresting that you said the body does do something to constrict vessels when bleeding happens but the brain says to keep circulating, but I guess we can say the harnesses represent that (although it still didn't help the situation). Quite crazy seeing that landscape just being empty with a cliff, as it can be thematically dark if there were no dust there.\n\nAnyway, I assume the RBC's were in the head area (beyond the wound) when snow started to fall? And when she finally gave O2 to the cell that had his own last will, that it was in that head part? Seeing they are roasting marshmallows and we saw lots of fire on that area before, I assume that's what the emergency report is showing.\n\nReally enjoyed your comments, adding to the \"doctor approved\" recommendations about Cells at Work.",

    "body": "so i've seen a few people mention using honey on their face as a cleanser or a mask (i've used it myself too!) and it seems to be something that could be really helpful for people who have drier, acne-prone skin. i started to look up one thing in response to a question in another thread, found a bunch of stuff, and decided to throw it all into one new post.\n\n**what is honey?**\n\nhoney is a food made by bees from the nectar of flowers. it is mostly sugar (fructose, glucose, matose, and sucrose).\n\nwhen you buy honey at the store, you usually have a number of different options. pasteurized honey (the cheaper syrupy kind in a bear-shaped bottle) and raw honey (a gritty, crystal-y product usually sold in a jar) are the two types i think are most common.\n\nthe average pH of honey is about 3.9, which a typical range of 3.4 to 6.1. \n\n**why would you put honey on your face?**\n\nhoney offers a number of benefits for the skin!\n\n* it is a humectant. this is probably due to certain components in the honey, such as sugars, amino acids, and lactic acid. this means that honey will attract moisture and trap it on your skin. honey is also occlusive, meaning that it essentially forms a protective film and it is extra good at trapping moisture in your skin!\n* its antimicrobial (both antibacterial and antifungal) effects are super well attested, meaning it should be helpful in treating acne and other skin conditions. the antimicrobial properties of honey are due to a number of factors, including its sugar content (and the osmotic effect of sugar), its hydrogen peroxide content (which is produced because of enzyme activity in the honey), its acidity, and potentially some plant-derived substances.\n* it contains a number of naturally occurring acids, including acetic, butyric, citric, \nformic, gluconic, lactic, malic, pyroglutamic, and succinic. this might mean that honey could offer some mild exfoliation benefits, particularly because of the lactic acid.\n* it has anti-inflammatory effects.\n* some recent studies have shown that honey may offer antioxidant benefits.\n\n**does it matter what kind of honey you put on your face?**\n\nshort answer: no.\n\nlong answer:  \nmany people have suggested that raw honey is a better choice than pasteurized honey. however, it's been proven both raw and pasteurized honey show the same level of antimicrobial activity. and because the other benefits of honey (the humectant/occlusive properties, etc) are attributed to components of honey that aren't removed during pasteurization (sugars), i think we can safely assume that those benefits are also exactly the same in both raw and pasteurized honey.\n\nanother type of honey that people sometimes praise as being better than other honey is manuka honey. manuka honey is produced specifically from the nectar of the manuka tree (aka the \"tea tree\"). it's possible that this is because people assume that since tea tree oil is great for treating acne, and honey is great for treating acne, honey from the tea tree must be extra great at treating acne. however, it does not appear that this is true. manuka honey is somewhat special because it appears that its antimicrobial properties have nothing to do with its content of hydrogen peroxide (unlike other honeys), but it has not been shown to be a more effective product than other honeys. in fact, for certain fungal infections, a much higher concentration of manuka honey than regular honey was required to inhibit fungal growth.\n\n**how should you put honey on your face?**\n\nwhen used as a dressing for wounds, it appears that soaking a dressing with honey, applying that dressing to the wound, and then covering the area with another dressing is the most convenient and effective method. to use honey as an overnight spot treatment, you could replicate this by placing a dab of honey on the affected area and covering it with a small bandage that has a gauze pad in it. you could also try soaking a small piece of a gauze pad in honey, applying that to the affected area, and then covering the area with something else. results observed when using honey as a wound dressing in clinical practice suggest that if you can keep the honey dressing on the wound for 24 hours, you should begin to see improvement by that point. if you are only using honey as an overnight spot treatment, it may take longer to see effects.\n\nnote: the pH of honey is slightly more acidic than what you really want to put on your face, so it may be best to dilute the honey with water or oil if you can before using it as a spot treatment. studies on honey's antibacterial activity show that it can be diluted down to about 45% v/v for manuka honey and 20% v/v for other honey and still be effective against fungal infections. against bacterial infections, all types of honey are effective down to about a 10% v/v solution. \n\nif you are not into DIY-ing honey-soaked wound dressings for your face, using honey as a mask will probably offer a lot of the same benefits. apply the honey to your clean face, let it sit for however long you want (at least a couple of minutes), and then remove gently with a warm damp washcloth and go about the rest of your routine as usual. ideally you wouldn't want to cleanse again after the mask because that might counteract a lot of the moisturizing benefits, and any residue from the honey might still offer antibacterial benefits, but if you feel like the mask leaves sticky residue that bothers you, then go ahead and cleanse.\n\ni didn't find anything to suggest that honey would make a good cleanser - the benefits of that would come from just having it on your face, not rubbing it around with water or anything, so you might as well just do a mask.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nbecause it is both moisturizing and antibacterial, honey could potentially be great for people who have drier or dehydrated acne-prone skin as an alternative to other antimicrobial treatments (which are typically drying or irritating). but as always, patch test on unbroken skin first!! and if you have any allergy, especially a contact allergy, to any flowering plants, you should probably avoid honey from those plants. \n\n\n____________\n\nsources: most of these are available as free full-text articles. if the link doesn't take you

    "body": "**What are they?**\n--\n\n\"Actives\" are the common term for the group of power players in skincare with ingredients that have direct, active results on the skin, and have serious science backing it up.  These include acids like AHAs and BHAs, and antioxidants like Vitamin C and Vitamin A (retinol and tretinoin). \n\n\n**AHAs:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n-\nAlpha Hydroxy Acids (**AHA**) are **water-soluble** and dissolve the bonds of skin cells on the outer layers of the skin, sloughing off dead skin and the glue that holds them together. This is *not immediate*, it just speeds up the process. This helps brighten and plump skin so it is not uncommon to recommend them to users who want to **combat fine lines and signs of aging**, are looking to **reverse sun damage or hyperpigmentation**, or are seeking a **more even skin tone and texture** in general. All AHAs have humectant properties, making them particularly nice for dry skin types with continued use. They all also **increase photosensitivity**, meaning sunscreen is even more important while using an AHA! There are also sources that show that AHAs increase dermal thickness and improve collagen density as well as quality of elastic fibers. [1](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081) [2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x/abstract;jsessionid=8F1BD9BC1178A87ADF7E90B6EBD17F44.d02t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false) [3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false)\n\nMost Common Types:\n--\n\n* **Glycolic Acid:**  It has the smallest molecules in the group so can penetrate skin deeply and easily, making it the most effective for treating fine lines, acne, blackheads, dullness, oiliness etc. An all around good choice but for its efficacy might be harsh for some, especially in the beginning during purging. Because of it's harshness, it might be better for oily skin types or users who have already built up a tolerance to AHAs. Sensitive skintypes or users who are new to acids might want to be cautious.  Glycolic Acid is **derived from cane sugar.** \n\n* **Lactic Acid:** Milder than glycolic but has smaller molecules than mandelic, making lactic acid kind of just the middle man in this hierarchy. Still gentle enough where sensitive skintypes won't necessarily need as much caution. Good for all skin types. **Do not use if you have milk allergies.** \n\n* **Mandelic Acid:** Larger molecules than both glycolic and lactic, which means it takes longer to penetrate but is also the least irritating, which is beneficial during the purge period. Ideal for very sensitive skin types. This AHA is made from almonds, so **do not use if you have nut allergies.** \n\n**PHAs:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n--\n\nPoly Hydroxy Acids (**PHA**)  function essentially the same as AHAs, however are far less irritating due to larger molecular structures, which limits their ability to penetrate into the skin. **Studies currently show no increased photosensitivity**, and **have been found to be compatible with clinically sensitive skin, including those with rosacea and atopic dermatitis**. All PHAs provide **humectant *and* moisturization properties** and enhanced barrier function. Most contain **antioxidants that protect cell lipids and membranes from UV damage**. In a study directly comparing AHAs to PHAs, sallowness and pinch recoil were shown to have greater improvement with AHAs but stinging and degree of sensitivity were rated worse for the AHA regimen as well. This makes PHA a great alternative and the so-called \"next gen\" of AHA.  [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15002656) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14756648) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15002657)\n\nMost Common Types:\n--\n\n...I kind of feel like this is a misnomer because PHAs are overall not as common or as studied compared to BHAs and AHAs right now. Still, here's what I've found so far, I'll be adding more as I find more information on them:\n\n* **Lactobionic Acid:** Derived from lactose, is a humectant, antioxidant and soothing. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20367666) compared lactobionic acid to glycolic acid, although I feel like it probably should be more compared to Lactic Acid. \n\n* **Gluconic Acid:** Also known as gluconolactone, is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. According to [this](http://128.11.40.183/lasernews/rubin_lecture/21.html), a 6% decrease in dermal penetration compared to glycolic acid. \n\n\n\n**BHAs:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n--\n\nWhile AHAs certainly aid in fighting acne, Beta Hydroxy Acids (**BHA**) are **oil-soluble** and therefore penetrate deeper in the skin, thereby degunking pores and breaking comedones. This process helps to bring things to the surface thereby making it a common suggestion for those **fighting and preventing acne** and looking for a **clearer complexion.** BHAs have no humectant properties, and are actually quite drying, making them particularly recommended to oily-skin types. BHAs **do not increase photosensitivity** with use. [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21921960) [2](https://www.drugs.com/mmx/salicylic-acid.html)\n\nMost Common Types:\n--\n\n* **Salicylic Acid:** is really the most common BHA player in the game, and it isn't *actually* a BHA  :3  It just essentially functions as one. Salicylic acid is commonly made by acidifying sodium salicylate (which is the salt of the of the salicylate ion). You pop off the sodiums and put hydrogens on there, and voila, salicylic acid. Is in general suitable for all skin types but preferred by oily skin types.  **Do not use if you have an allergy to aspirin.**\n\n* **Betaine Salicylate:** Essentially the salicylate is cut with betaines to provide a far more mild BHA exfoliation. Betaines are useful for helping prevent dehydration of the skin as they are larger in molecule and have a milder keratolytic effect. Suitable for all skin types but might benefit dry/dehydrated skin that find salicylic acid too drying. **Still don't use if you have an allergy to aspirin? At the very least patch test.**\n\n**Vitamin C Serum:**\n--\n\nA comprehensive guide to vitamin c serums can be found by /u/MissPicklesMeow, [The More You Know: Vitamin C Serum FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/)\n\n**Retinoids:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n--\n\nRetinoids slough off dead skin cells the way AHAs do, while also being anti-inflammatory, making them great for fighting **acne, anti-aging, and hyper-pigmentation.** They also function as cell-communicators: **improving the way your skin sheds and causing new skin cells to divide and function at their best** - which helps prevent premature aging and stimulate collagen. They come with anti-oxidants, but also come with a fair amount of irritation, more than the previous categories. [1](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/464026_2) [2](http://www.skinacea.com/retinoids/what-are-retinoids.html)\n\nMost Common Types:\n\n\n * **Over-the-counter available:** From weakest to strongest: retinyl palmitate, retinol, and retinaldehyde are all available without prescriptions. Most products with retinyl palmitate are often too weak to provide any major skin benefits, especially in terms of anti-aging - Retinol takes two metabolic steps to be converted into retinoic acid, while retinyl palmitate takes three steps. \n\n * **Prescription strength retinoids:** From weakest to strongest: Adapalene, Tretinoin (or retinoic acid), Tazarotene, Isotretinoin. Aside from the type of retinoid, each individual product also has its own individual retinoid concentrations. Generally, you go with the strongest retinoid you can tolerate with the least amount of irritation, even if that retinoid is considered weak. \n\nA note: Retinoid creams do not replace or substitute moisturizers, though you can certainly cut them into the moisturizer to try and buffer irritation. \n\n---\n\n**Popular Products:**\n--\nCosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid\n\nNeulii Teatree BHA Blemish Control Serum\n\n CosRx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid\n\nMizon AHA 8% Peeling Serum\n\nMelano CC Spot Treatment\n\nOST C20 and C21.5\n\n*For a more comprehensive list on AHAs/BHAs, check out /u/the_acid_queen's [Asian Acids: an AHA/BHA Supercut](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3l78ir/asian_acids_an_ahabha_supercut/). For Western recommendations, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/exfoliation_recs) is a good starting point*\n\n---\n\n\n**Commonly Asked Questions:**\n--\n\n * ***How come there aren't that many AB options for these categories?***\n\nBasically, there just isn't (or wasn't) a market for it. The typical consumer is not interested in any product that would cause any irritation, even if they might ultimately prove beneficial to a routine. So the AB brands shy away from it since there just isn't much money to be made from it. CosRx and others do have an online base, and so their approach and market might be slightly different, but is by and large not a reflection on the overall trends in Asia currently, though we may see changes in this in the future. \n\n* ***Where in my routine should these products go?***\n\nThe [Product and Routine Order FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2tokdr/product_and_routine_order_faq/) on the sidebar has this covered in detail and in resources, however the one resource I link to the most from that page is /u/fanserviced's [Visual Guide to the Korean Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3jfug1/visual_guide_to_the_korean_skincare_routine/?sort=old) which is a nice quick cheat sheet to reference. You do *not* need every step included in a routine, it just shows every possible step and where it would be included. \n\n* ***How often should I use these products?***\n\n2-3 times a week is a good general frequency, seeing how your skin reacts and upping or lowering the frequency from there depending on concentration. With retinol products, depending on strength, you might want to only start with once a week. If the retinol burns, you can wash it off and try again the next night. \n\n* ***What about wait times?***\n\nWait times comes into the equation when you consider that these products are pH-dependent and work the best at specific pHs. This also dictates their product order. In following this thought process, you would have to wait 15-20  minutes after cleansing to let your skin return to its natural pH, and then 15 minutes after the application of any/every acid applied after to allow it the time to absorb and exfoliate entirely. \n\nThat said, this topic actually gets debated every now and then. You will find users who do not adhere to any wait times and see no difference, others find that waiting can enhance exfoliation and prefer to wait for pH levels optimal for exfoliating, and other users still who will tell you that wait times led them to over-exfoliation and was too much for their skin. Potentially, not *every* skin is going to need their actives working at its most effective range,  so the tl;dr is, YMMV. Start with no wait times, at least through the purge period. As you get used to a regular exfoliation schedule and learn how your skin reacts to it, try adding in a wait time in increments of 5 minutes, up to 20 minutes. See what your skin likes best. \n\n\n\n* ***What exactly are pH-adjusting toners and do I need one in my routine?***\n\npH adjusting toners lowers the pH of your skin after cleansing, readying it for pH-dependent actives. They typically have some acids in them, but at such low concentrations that they are not effective exfoliators. \n \nWe do have a [pH toner list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3e39ly/do_we_have_a_toner_ph_list_and_faq_and_if_not_can/) but I think it needs an updating - It's still quite a useful resource to find out if your toner is hydrating or pH adjusting. \n\nMy personal conclusions from everything I've read (and I'm not an expert disclaimer goes here):\n\n-Tap water does potentially increase the pH of the skin surface, even with a low pH cleanser. [1](http://www.sebamed.fr/client/document/effects-soap_94.pdf)\n\n-There is a correlation between low skin surface and enhanced functions of recovery. Low pH cleansers are more important to this than water pH. [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467032)\n\n-Starting around ages ~40+, the emphasis on needing to lower overall skin surface pH to maintain healthy barrier starts to become more important as it cannot recover as it once used to. [3](http://file.scirp.org/Html/2-1050013_7244.htm) [4](http://emjreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/Skin-pH-in-the-Elderly-and-Appropriate-Skin-Care.pdf)\n\n-Continued use of acids can lower the skin pH overall, but overdoing it will lead to irritation. Which is why some skintypes *can't* handle it working at its most effective range, because it's overkill. Making the rise of the skin surface pH from the tap water and/or eliminating wait times fully/partially actually a good thing, because it then makes it more balanced, gentle and less effective during the ages or the skintype wherein it's more preventative rather than reactive. \n\nSo, if you aren't reacting to your water (some people can), if you and/or your skin's age is not yet near 40, and especially if you are new to actives, I would actually suggest not even worrying about any of it yet.  Trying to go full blast when your skin doesn't need it yet is a common reason why a lot of people end up over exfoliating or experiencing irritation. As recommended above, start with no wait times until you get used to a regular schedule and see how your skin reacts to waiting. If you find you are waiting 20 minutes after cleansing, start looking at pH adjusting toners.   \n\n\n\n* ***How do I patch test actives?***\n\nWith consideration to there being a purge period, it's a bit pointless to patch test for irritation with these products. You still need to patch test for allergy or immediate adverse reaction, which takes a 24 hour test and should be applied to a small 1\" area of the face. Once that is done and cleared you can move forward with full face, taking careful note of how your skin reacts through the purge period. \n\n* ***Wait, what's purging and how do I tell the difference between breaking out?***\n\nWhen you use any exfoliating active - BHA, AHA, peels, or retinoids -  your skin will start to push out all the gunk from inside towards the surface. Which means if you have clogged pores, expect it to turn into whiteheads, if you have pimples, they might start looking worse. This process is called purging, can only happen with these actives (meaning **you cannot purge from a new basic moisturizer**), and details the process that **things get worse and then start getting better.** \n\nThe time frame for seeing improvement after purging should be 3-4 weeks, but it can - with stronger actives like retinoids - take even longer - But you should still start seeing improvements by that time. My suggestion is to **wait at least one month**, taking extra care to **listen to your skin** and look out for signs that it might not be purging:\n\n-If they get worse and stay worse, that is not purging. \n\n-If you start having *persistent* break outs in places that is not normal for you to break out, it is not purging (purging = short term, break out = long term).\n\n-If you experience tiny red bumps and itching, that is probably an allergic reaction and not purging. \n\n-If you stop using the product and your skin immediately calms down, then your skin was experiencing irritation rather than purging. If you stop use and your skin does not calm down but stays the same, then it was purging or a breakout. If your skin feels hot, prickly, or more sensitive than usual, than it is more than likely irritation or a sign that you are over-exfoliating. \n\n* ***What are the signs of over-exfoliating?***\n\n*Subtle to medium signs of over-exfoliating:* Shiny skin/forehead, increased oil production, puffiness, slight increase of sensitivity, breakouts of the small yet annoying scale, overall feeling of tightness/dryness/loss of moisture, blotchiness, patchiness, redness.\n\n*The your-skin-is-screaming-at-you-to-stop signs:* Burning, itching, feeling of heat, extreme sensitivity, cystic eruptions. Your face will be angry, it's kind of hard to miss. \n\nYou could show subtle to medium signs for a while and not realize it if you aren't in tune to your skin. Some people react in like a day, and that sucks but at least it's easy - others it can get bad only after a couple weeks to up to a month.\n\n\n* ***I over-exfoliated :( How do I repair my barrier and how long will it take?***\n\nWell, the first thing is to cut out all exfoliators until your skin bounces back. Then, go bland with the rest of your routine. Make sure you're washing your face with a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser and prioritize hydrating and moisturizing your face until your skin can repair itself. Ceramides, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, zinc oxide, aloe, snail are among the ingredients that will help the most during this period, so having them in your arsenal helps even before you start using actives. As far as how long it will take, be patient, it can take up to a month or more for your barrier to repair itself. \n \n\n* ***Are there any bad combinations or ingredients that shouldn't go together?***\n\n-Copper peptides and vitamin C can cancel each other out \n[1](http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/content/94/4/1259.short) but other sources say it's likely a myth and needs further study. \n\n-Niacinamide can cause flushing in some people when introduced to acidic pHs, particularly L-AA vitamin c serums, but not everybody is sensitive to this. If you find you are sensitive, a 20 minute wait time between products should be enough to combat this. Have two opposing sources on this topic:  [1](http://kindofstephen.com/can-you-use-niacinamide-and-vitamin-c-ascorbic/) [2](https://www.futurederm.com/should-niacinamide-and-l-ascorbic-acid-be-used-together/)\n\n-Retinoids and waxing do not go together. Even at low strengths, you can irritate and/or lift skin when waxing while having a retinoid in your routine. Your esthetician should ask you beforehand. \n\n-Benzoyl peroxide can render topical tretinoin ineffective, but the combo is okay when formulated properly to be together [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958193/)\n\n-Seriously, make sure you're wearing sunscreen if you are using AHAs or retinoids. I mean, you should be diligent about sunscreen anyways, but seriously guis. You'll do more damage than good if you begin use of these products and do not use sunscreen. \n\n-When starting multiple actives, it's mostly just common sense that dictates to ease in very slowly. Retinol especially, you might want to cut out all actives for a while and re-introduce them later once you've built some tolerance. It isn't so much that it's bad to have it in one routine, it's just way easier to experience over-exfoliation and irritation. You want to avoid that by practicing caution and going slow. \n\n\n* ***Do PoC and/or darker skin tones benefit from a certain types more than others?***\n\nI've found hearsay about how darker skin tones tend to prefer glycolic acid over others, and I've found hearsay that has said that PoC tend to experience more irritation than others when using acids to the point where glycolic is even discouraged. So. I wanted to address all of these notes specifically with some extra research, and have found the following:\n\nThere *is* [a larger risk of PIH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921758/pdf/jcad_3_7_20.pdf) in regards to use of acids in any large percentage, ie, chemical peels. \n\n\nAs far as overall irritation and risk, here is a study on the [effect on Asian skin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9107290), one targeting the [effect on darker skin tones of Indians with melasma](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12269877), and one [comparing glycolic to mandelic](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-4725.2008.34383.x/full) - In this the combination of mandelic *and* salicylic proved more effective but took longer to showcase than simply using glycolic. All of these studies say yay. good to go on using acids. I also found [salicylic was safe and improved acne and hyperpigmentation in darker racial ethnic groups](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9935087). So, aside from the risk of PIH cited from the first study, no further risk for irritations should be expected compared to other groups, nor is one acid shown to be more favorable than another? At least not from what I've found?\n\nIn [Management of hyperpigmentation in darker racial ethnic groups](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19608057) ([full text here](http://www.obgynnews.com/fileadmin/content_pdf/san/scms_pdf/Vol28_i2_Hyperpigmentation.pdf)) it's concluded that \"Given the propensity of darker skin to hyperpigment, peeling agents and resurfacing procedures should be used with care and caution. Maximal results are best achieved with repetitive, superficial, resurfacing modalities.\" \n\nSo with all that, I would say it's not a matter of one acid being better than another for darker skin tones, or that they experience more irritation. They do however have to **take special care and caution for melasma and hyperpigmentation, and in that it's moreso the method than the acid- Lower percentages for long term maintenance are more ideal than higher percentages for short term resurfacing and peels.** If anyone has further research, insights, or thoughts on this subject I'd love to hear about it! \n\n---\n\n**Potentially Interesting Discussions:**\n--\n\n[Support group for over-exfoliators](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tac9m/can_we_have_a_support_group_for_overexfoliators/)\n\n[Keratosis pilaris and body exfoliation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3quyvs/keratosis_pilaris_korean_spasscrubs_and_a_body/) and [Let's talk about body exfoliation!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4d42w1/lets_talk_about_body_exfoliation/)\n\n[AB versus Western](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/31iuia/has_anyone_found_an_ab_ahabha_better_than_the/)\n\n[A Note on Acids and UV photosensitivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4rq809/a_note_on_acids_and_uv_photosensitivity/)\n\n[How do Asians exfoliate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2brprj/how_do_asians_exfoliate/)\n\n[How often/which actives do you use?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4hw5br/how_oftenwhich_actives_do_you_use_how_long_did_it/)\n\n[Your thoughts on physical exfoliation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3gbs7q/your_thoughts_on_physical_exfoliation/)\n\n[Stacking too many products cause clashing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2vq3ex/can_ingredients_clash_when_stacking_so_many/)\n\n[Using actives - What's your story?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4chp7w/using_actives_whats_your_story/)\n\n[Which actives worked best for you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/400tkx/actives_vitamin_c_aha_bha_which_active_works_best/)\n\n[Washing off chemical exfoliators?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/48aahj/if_bhaahas_are_chemical_exfoliates_do_you_wash_it/)\n\n[AB Retinol Products?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/39by5n/retinol_products/)\n\n[For those who went through over-exfoliation, did it slowly start showing signs, or did you suddenly wake up with over exfoliated skin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3vgdmi/for_those_who_went_through_overexfoliation_did_it/)\n\n\n-[For those of you that have tried no/minimal wait times between multiple acids, what was your experience?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3z895r/for_those_of_you_that_have_tried_nominimal_wait/)\n\n-[ELI5/questions on toners, wait times, pH, etc](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/32mq81/eli5questions_on_toners_wait_times_ph_etc/)\n\n-[Skin pH and Urban Legends: An Argument Against Wait Times and pH-Adjusting Toners](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3vfa7s/blog_post_skin_ph_and_urban_legends_an_argument/) \n\n---\n\nFeel free to submit links for any of the above parts, discuss actives in your routine, submit a question for the FAQs or a discussion link for the PID sections.

The pads I've been using on Tuesday and Saturday.  \n\nAm I playing with fire, or am I just essentially using similar enough products that I should narrow it down to the one my skin responds to best?  I've tried poking around a few times to see if I could find routines that used these products in conjuction and didn't turn up much.  \n\nI openly admit this is an area I'm not familiar with, so I've been trying to do my reading but the differing opinions out there are getting confusing. Taking a shot that maybe someone here can help, even if it's a slap upside my head.\n\nMy skintype is combination that trends towards oily, and is sensitive. Concerns include hormonal and stress related breakouts, anti-aging. I'm mostly doing well with my routine - this area just has me stumped.\n\nEdit: format and skintype",

    "body": "Man I'm gonna type a lot of shit, but there's a lot of misinformation or incomplete information out there. Some advice is good and some is bad and not many responses go into WHY x or y workout is good or bad besides \"this works for me\" or \"so-and-so said to do this\", so this post is an attempt to educate on the physiology of our energy systems and how you can improve it to suit your need.\n\nThere are several aspects to BJJ cardio, but the base of it is general cardiovascular fitness. In competition everyone wants to have sustained high output capability (and ability to recover quickly in between matches), and in training everyone wants to have the ability to roll for two hours. Those are two different energy systems, anaerobic and aerobic. Building your aerobic base will directly and positively affect your ability to develop your anaerobic system which is why professional athletes have base building blocks in the off season before development of anaerobic skills such as speed and sprinting. The *aerobic* system is also the one primarily responsible for quick recovery.\n\nThink of general cardio fitness as your gas tank. If you have a high horsepower/low fuel mileage sports car, you can go fast as fuck but burn through your gas in 30 seconds. If you expand your gas tank, you can go at the same speed, but longer, or much slower and much longer. Either way you're limited by your gas tank. That's your aerobic system, or said another way, your mitochondrial efficiency. The \"problem\" with developing your aerobic base is it takes longer bouts of effort (40-60 mins +, 3-4 days a week) at lower intensity (ideally zone 2), which people generally have a negative view of for several reasons. \n\n1. Some people just don't want to put in the time. Some people don't have the time to put in.\n2. People don't feel like they \"get anything out of it\" because cardio at a conversational pace seems too easy to do anything. People want to huff and puff and hurt and feel like they accomplished something.\n3. The adaptations afforded by long zone 2 aren't readily visible and take *consistent* effort in order to develop. \n\nSaid most generally, zone 2 is exercise performed at a conversational pace. It's a pace you can sustain for an hour or more, around 60-70/75% of your max heart rate. For runners/cyclists, this feels like a painfully slow pace. Research has shown zone 2 is the optimal intensity for the development of mitochondrial efficiency, or your ability to use oxygen for the generation of ATP (your body's energy molecule) via the electron transport chain in your mitochondria. This is what we refer to as aerobic exercise. In exercise physiology, this occurs primarily in your slow twitch (type I) muscle fibers, whereas your fast twitch (type II) fibers do not have as many mitochondria and are much more reliant on the glycolytic/anaerobic pathway to produce ATP. Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cells. By performing exercise for continuous, prolonged periods of time in zone 2, in essence you induce adaptations in your mitochondria (and make more mitochondria) to be able to utilize oxygen more efficiently meaning you make more energy in the form of ATP to be able to perform for longer periods of time. \n\nIn addition, when you get tired and your muscles are burning, the sensation is in large part due to lactic acid/lactate buildup which is a by-product of glycolysis/anaerobic pathway for ATP generation. Slow twitch muscle fibers have mitochondria which are able to uptake lactate for use in the production of ATP as well, so lactate produced by your fast twitch muscles can get cleared and utilized by your slow twitch fibers if they are efficient enough to do so. The more efficient your mitochondria are, the greater rate this occurs at and the greater lactate load your body is able to handle before you fatigue and feel like you can't go on. This of course also means quicker recovery in between bouts of effort.\n\nZone 2 is mostly referred to in endurance sports such as running, cycling, and swimming. However, I do believe that it can be achieved through BJJ as well, albeit more difficult by nature of the sport. Zone 2 is best performed at a steady state; in jiu jitsu we often have intermittent periods where we need to be a little more explosive ie: when escaping or scrambling. If you want to develop your cardio entirely through jiu jitsu, I believe this can be done provided you are drilling/rolling continuously for a lengthy period of time at a conversational pace. This basically equates to light flow rolling/drilling, without taking breaks for 40-60 mins+. Not factored in is age and natural athleticism, where younger and more athletic people may have a naturally higher \"conversational pace\" than the sedentary 40 year old desk jockey.\n\nTherefore, to develop your cardio to improve general aerobic capacity and anaerobic ability, you need to do zone 2 base building. I'm not even going to get into the oxidation of fat as a result of zone 2 or the pathways for glucose/fatty acids. Zone 2 can be done through different forms of exercise depending on your fitness level: running, swimming, cycling, walking, rolling. All of this is NOT to say that hill sprints/sprints/HIIT doesn't have its place. It does, but it's not as useful without an aerobic base first. The dosage is also commonly misunderstood. By definition, high intensity shit is high intensity, which places a significant amount of stress on the body and central nervous system. In jiu jitsu, this would be your high intensity competition-paced rolls. You cannot physically roll like that 100% of the time if your training volume is high. Just the same, you cannot JUST be doing sprints once a week to get fit, nor can you JUST do sprints 3 times a week at a high enough intensity to make a difference. Try that for a long enough period and you will most likely injure yourself or burn out/be constantly sick from a depressed immune state (akin to overtraining). If you listen to most of the great trainers such as Firas Zahabi or Inigo San Millan (Tour cyclist coach), they all advocate for majority of training being done at a comfortable and easy pace. Not ALL of your training, but most. This has so many beneficial factors: keeping you injury free so you can train more often, training more often = getting better faster. Building aerobic base, so you can train longer. Training more often AND training longer per session = getting better at light speed. Throw in HIIT once or twice a week on top of your zone 2, or don't. Bang for your buck, zone 2 will do you far more good.\n\nDespite this wall of text critting you for 42069 damage, it's a very basic explanation, I'm speaking in generalities, and there's lots of things I'm leaving out. If you have any questions (or corrections) hit me up. There's also a lot of shit I don't know, but as far as the research and knowledge I've acquired over years and years of science education and being interested in this shit, it's about as concise as I can make it for a general explanation.\n\nTLDR: Want better cardio? Do steady state low intensity zone 2 shit 3-4 days a week 40-60 minutes or more at a time. Not medical advice.",

It has helped a lot for my tournaments and rolls. I also didn't realize, when I'm about 5 weeks out of my tournament, I increase the pace of my rolls. This increased rate I was told mimics HIIT, so you can actually perform a HIIT exercise while rolling. \n\nIt is honestly so much damn work adding cardio outside of class, specially if you have a family, job, side projects and just not much spare time in general, but it is seriously worth it.",

        "body": "I'm going to take a WHOLE different level to this conversation on cardio that I have seen so many times...\n\n...why do you think black belts can roll for hours and not get that tired? You think they have developed a massive cardio tank after all their hours of rolling? \n\n**It's efficiency**. They aren't wasting their energy unnecessarily. They are timing their attacks. They are baiting. They make you do all the work, fall into traps, there's no moving you, you move yourself. If they want your head postured, they will pull it down, you'll most likely just push in the exact opposite direction and posture up, bam, problem solved. They aren't muscling your head up, which wastes energy. It's knowing the tricks to make you do all the work while they chill. \n\n**It's confidence**. Would you need a bigger tank to roll someone who was half your size and a brand new person? No. You would be laughing and just moving around them, as they spazzed out and exhausted themselves. Do you know why people exhausts themselves in 5 minutes in a competition match yet they can do an hour in the gym no problem? **Anxiety**. They start muscling everything, forcing everything, holding their breath, it's *adrenaline*. Your body starts freaking out and moving hard. If you have full confidence you can get something, you would not spaz. \n\n**It's breathing**. They are calm and confidence, which allows them to take deep breaths, while their muscles do all the necessary flexing when the time is right. Most of the exhaustion I see is people holding their breath and exploding outwards. \n\nThe more you train, it's not the cardio that gets better, **it's your confidence and efficiency that allows you to not gas your system**. Yes obviously you'll get better cardio in general, but I would say 90% of the time these early problems can be solved by a few things: \n\n1. Better your Escape game: People panic when they are in bad positions because they don't know what to do and muscle out of everything. If you know solid escape strategies, you dilemma people out and it's not easy but a lot less body/mental taxing on your system.\n2. Better your Submission game: If your technique is on point, you shouldn't be flexing your whole body and squeezing for your life for 10 seconds for a submission. Technical precision creates a powerful tension with joint locks and strangles.\n3. Create an \"A Game\": If you know you have a path of always getting a submission, you'll panic less because you know if you want a tap, it's only a few steps away.\n\nAnd remember: **IT'S ALL JUST A GAME**. This isn't life-or-death, even at a local tournament it's for a 5-dollar medal. You're playing this awesome game and having fun with friends. If you can't find an opportunity to laugh during a roll, you're brain is treating this like fight-or-flight, and if your mind is like that, there's a good chance your technical knowledge isn't there to have you be capable in a live rolling situation, which comes back to your coach that should be giving you the skillsets to be more confident in those situations.",

Does Zone 2 weightlifting convey different work capacity benefits than Zone 2 running?

One of my employees was an up and coming bodybuilder, fresh out of high school, and encouraged me to go to the gym with him. \"What the hell,\" I thought, after making excuses not to for six weeks straight. \n\nI used to be in phenomenal shape, now I'm a pudgy, mid-30's pile of shit. So I was ready to look like myself again. So, while we're at the gym, I'm doing my absolute best to keep up with this kid. He does a set on the bench press, I follow suit (I can't bench press 220 like he was, but I did a nice 95). Then we move into cardio. Then the machines. Then yoga. Then more free weights. At the end of the day, sure, I was sore as hell. But I felt good. I was ready to get back in shape!\n\nFast forward to the next morning, when I'm sore as hell and can't move any parts of my body. It felt like a full body cast; this is what I was expecting. What I WASNT expecting was what happened when I took a piss. It was brown. And soupy. I swear to god, it looked like I was pissing shit. Kinda scary, I guess. So I did what anyone would do: I cried in the shower, got out, and called my mom to take me to the emergency room. \n\nI get an IV, was told it's just mild strain then sent home. Next day, more shit-piss. More emergency room. This time they test me. Rhabdomyalisis. Rhabdomyalisis is something professional athletes and bodybuilders get, when the lactic acid in our muscles don't break down properly, and leak into your kidneys. From intense work outs and game playing or whatever athletic types do. But sure enough, I had it. But, I don't fuck around, apparently. When the doctor saw how bad it was, he immediately admitted me to the hospital wing. For 8 days. \n\nTurns out I was about 2 more reps away from total kidney failure, and death. Doc said I had the highest CKP(?) count he'd ever seen. Normal numbers are around 7 or 8 hundred. I clocked in at around 45,000.... so, yeah. Think I fucked Up. \n\nTl;Dr: Worked out with a high school kid and got rhabdo for my efforts. Cheetos are easier to lift anyway. ",

    "body": "Hey everyone, I'm a retired Physical Therapist and with the holidays coming up I decided to write up a detailed review on comparisons between the Hypervolt and the Theragun Prime. A lot of my friends have been debating between the two and asked me the differences so I thought I'd just put this out there. Here we go!\n\n[\\($270 Hypervolt vs. \\($300\\) Theragun](https://preview.redd.it/xvksceehp7261.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=562cb555782beb84e0eecc783847903f4d511b42)\n\n# REVIEW:\n\nYou may have seen one of the thousands of iterations of massage guns that are taking over the internet this year and wondered which one is the best one?¬†\n\nBut today I‚Äôm comparing two of the most well known brands that have risen to the top of the massage gun rat race in **Hyperice‚Äôs Flagship Hypervolt ($270 at time of posting)** and **Therabody‚Äôs Theragun Prime ($300)**. You‚Äôve seen them on Instagram, at your local Best Buy or at your local gym. But which one is the one for you?¬†\n\n# Which One is Better? Keep reading\n\nIf you came here wanting a simple answer of which one is better, I‚Äôm afraid this isn‚Äôt the guide for you. There isn‚Äôt a \"better\" when it comes to hypervolt or theragun and anyone who says one is objectively better isn‚Äôt really being fair. **Here‚Äôs why**. They‚Äôre actually two fundamentally different products. Apples and oranges. Understanding the differences should help you decide which one is for you .\n\nWhile both the **Hypervolt** and the **Theragun** are considered massage guns, they fall under two distinct categories of massage guns that provide two distinct experiences.¬†\n\nHyperice‚Äôs Hypervolt falls under the category of **Vibration type** massage device while the Therabody‚Äôs Theragun is a **Percussion type** massage device.¬†\n\n**Vibration type** massage devices are high frequency, low amplitude applications for localized regions meaning that the massage head travels a short distance between the muscle and the gun at a high rate. This results in localized muscle relaxation and increased blood flow to the area and helps reduce soreness by removing lactic acid built up in sore muscles. The Hypervolt is an excellent vibration type massager at 2000-32000 strokes per minute.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Percussive type** massagers, on the other hand, apply lower frequency and higher amplitude applications for a much more aggressive and ‚Äúpunchier‚Äù application. The Theragun starts at 1740 strokes per minute and caps out at 2400. The amplitude of the strokes is also significantly deeper at 16 mm compared to Theragun‚Äôs 10. As a result, the massage head penetrates the muscle fibers deeper than a vibration type massager resulting in potential musculoskeletal changes and range of motion improvements.¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Now, for real therapeutic effect for myofascial release and muscle lengthening, a significant amount of force must be applied regardless of device. However, a percussion massage device is designed for higher force over a smaller area than a vibration type massager.)¬†\n\nYou‚Äôll immediately notice the difference when you pick up a Theragun compared to a Hypervolt. The Theragun is much louder and feels quite aggressive while the Hypervolt feels more like a fine tuned machine that quietly hums and soothes. The Theragun really punches and digs while the Hypervolt soothes. Like I said, it depends on what you‚Äôre looking for.¬†\n\n# Tech Specs:¬†\n\n>**Stroke Length:**Hypervolt: 10mmTheragun: 16mm**Strokes Per Minute:**Hypervolt: 2000 - 3200 per minuteTheragun: 1740 - 2400 per minute**Stall Force:** (More on this later)¬†Hypervolt: 30 poundsTheragun: 30 pounds\n\nAccessibility Winner: Hypervolt\n\nI never thought about this category when it came to massage devices before, but I found it to be a critical factor in my user experience. As they say with camera‚Äôs, ‚ÄúThe best camera is the one you have on you‚Äù, I guess the best massage gun is the one you actually use.¬†\n\nI take my Hypervolt everywhere. I use it during movie nights with the family or I take it on long commutes in the car (drive safe people). I find those times to be perfect as my hands are free and I have a lot of time not doing something else. The Hypervolt is quiet enough to not disturb the people around me while I get a little extra relaxation from the massage. It‚Äôs not silent, but the low hum is unobtrusive.¬†\n\nHowever, on days where I‚Äôm particularly tight and need some more aggressive self-therapy, I find it falls short of what my body needs.¬†\n\nI have to set some special time aside for when I use my Theragun. First of all, it‚Äôs pretty intense. The percussive nature of the Theragun means that it‚Äôs going to be a more intense session than a relaxing session in the moment. I certainly can‚Äôt watch a movie with the Theragun as my wife would complain she can‚Äôt hear the movie over the whine and rattle of the massager. I can‚Äôt drive with it because it will shake my head too much to see straight. But when I need a serious knot taken out and when I‚Äôm really, really tight, the Theragun gets the job done, efficiently and effectively. While the 6 millimeter amplitude difference doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot, you‚Äôll feel the difference with every oscillation. The massage head is really able to penetrate the muscle belly and have a real lasting therapeutic effect with increased range of motion and reduced long term pain. But it does come at the cost of potential short term soreness.¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Stall Force: Tied\n\nBoth guns can stall if you put quite a bit of force on it. Theragun claims it can withstand 60 pounds of force which is probably an overestimation. The Theragun and the Hypervolt seem to stall at similar pressures though I didn‚Äôt do any objective test with a pressure meter or weights. This category is tied for me as I haven‚Äôt had a situation where the device stalled.¬†\n\n# Ergonomics: Theragun\n\nThe handle of the Theragun is a big winner in the ergonomics department. The triangle shape of the handle gives you multiple angles to attack an area and provides a variety of ways to get significant leverage, particularly around neck and shoulders. I was repeatedly frustrated at the cumbersome 90 degree fixed handle of the Hypervolt for anything on my neck and shoulders. I often had to use both hands at awkward angles to get enough torque. The handle is better suited to apply on someone else rather than yourself. The handle circumference on the Hypervolt is also on the larger side for those with smaller hands.¬†\n\nThe head options on the Theragun are also designed for a percussion device. You‚Äôll find a more narrow and pointier selection to allow for muscle penetration while the hyper volt has fairly broad and rounder heads meant for applying vibration over a wider area. Hypervolt‚Äôs pointiest head is pretty narrow, but the smaller amplitude doesn‚Äôt match the Theragun.¬†\n\n# Conclusion: It depends\n\n**Hypervolt: A Luxurious Spa Treatment**\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a more elegant, quiet and luxurious massager, then the **Hypervolt** may be the device for you. The battery life is above average, the device is quiet for a variety of situations, and the vibration frequency is quite high for a vibration type massage.¬†\n\n**Theragun:¬†A More Rigorous Therapeutic Treatment**\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a dedicated therapy session with a device that is powerful and effective for serious stiffness and range of motion deficits, then the Theragun may be your preferred device. At the cost of convenience and sound, the ergonomic handle combined with the robust 16 mm strike amplitude allows you to get below the surface and into the muscle fibers for real functional gains.¬†\n\n**For Me:**\n\nI find my family using the Hypervolt more regularly for small aches and soreness after a workout. It may seem silly, but the quiet non-intrusive nature of the Hypervolt makes it much more accessible with my family, especially during COVID. That alone makes it worth it. However, I find the Hypervolt to be a luxury that I get to use frequently while the Theragun is a therapeutic necessity. As time goes by, I find myself finding time to pick up the Theragun more and more as I consistently find better functional gains and more effective and efficient sessions. My wife on the other hand, hates it.¬†\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a serious therapy tool for your home and have time and space for it, the Theragun is the way to go.¬†\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a relaxing vibration massage for everyday relaxation, then the Hypervolt is your massage gun of choice.¬†\n\nHere's my review with [photos](https://spree.love/guidepost/1605217875387x823359289800523800)!\n\n**Footnote:**\n\nTheragun claims their new Pro and Elite guns are even quieter so it may be worth a look, but the price takes a quick jump up by hundreds. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try **TimTam‚Äôs** massage gun which I‚Äôve heard good things about. TimTam‚Äôs massage gun is another percussive type rather than a vibration type. It‚Äôs worth a look perhaps in future reviews.¬†",

The comment section here can be really helpful, but it was getting quite long, so we thought it would be good to start a new Beginner thread.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMany people come to look to revamp their current routines or create a new routine. While not all of the products mentioned here will work for 100% of people, this is a good place to start regardless of skin type/concern. \n\nThe products mentioned are those commonly recommended on the sub and by no means is it comprehensive. In addition, the products mentioned here tend to be affordable/widely available/effective for most people.\n\n**But PLEASE keep in mind that skincare is not an exact science and no one can guarantee success for an individual.**\nRecommendations on here have been the most well tolerated that we've encountered and users report a high degree of success with them. However, sensitivities are possible with any product and no product can guarantee 100% efficacy and tolerance in an entire population.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFirst,  **stop** using St. Ives Apricot Scrub!!! The particles are large, non-uniform, sharp, and too abrasive to be suitable for facial use. Also, ditch any citrus fruits on the face and baking soda scrubs. More info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/195lue/psa_please_do_not_use_baking_soda_on_your_skin_it/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/13wz1y/psa_lemons_and_limes_great_for_food_not_for_skin/). \n\nNext, **don't buy everything at once: include only 1 new product at a time**. Don't buy a new full blown routine if you don't need it!   Be patient, take your time, and **[Test patch](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/14sd25/i_just_learned_how_to_do_a_test_patch_properly/).**  .\n\nIf you can't seem to find a particular product in your country, a few online stores/companies can be helpful and ship internationally. These include [sasa](http://web1.sasa.com/SasaWeb/splash.jsp), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/), [iherb](http://www.iherb.com/), and [mmmule](http://mmmule.com/). \n\nNow, onto recommendations!!\n\n\n- **Cleanser** \n\n  We frequently tell folks it's not necessary to cleanse 2x a day, particularly for those suffering with oily/dehydrated/dry skin types. Exceptions include things like post-workouts or if you've been sweating through the night.\n\n  If your skin is feeling tight/dry/squeaky after cleansing, you should look for a new cleanser.\n\n  *Cleanser Recs*\n  \n  ~ Cerave Foaming (US/Canada): Suitable for acne prone\n\n  ~ Cerave Hydrating (US/Canada): Better for non-acne prone/dry\n\n  ~ Spectro Jel (Canada): Suitable for acne-prones\n\n  ~ Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash (UK/US/Canada/other?): Potentially suitable for all skin types\n\n  ~ Eucerin DermatoClean, \"gentle\" (Worldwide): Suitable for sensitive/acne prone\n\n  ~ [Oil Cleansing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/): Suitable for almost all skin types, but the oil/oils you use depends on your skin type. Those with SD should tread lightly with this method, as some oils can exacerbate the issue.\n\n  \n- **Exfoliation**\n\n  Chemical exfoliation is the preferred method on /r/skincareaddiction, it tends to be more gentle than physical exfoliation *and* you can do it daily. You can learn more about the different types of chemical exfoliators in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1hj8yo/whats_the_difference_ahas_vs_bhas/) sidebar post.  \n\n  Lactic acid is the most gentle, so if you suffer with eczema/rosacea prone sensitive skin, start with lactic.  If you're acne prone/have lots of clogs and/or oily, start with a BHA (salicylic acid). If you are combo, and want the humectant benefits of an AHA, try Mandelic---partly oil soluble AHA. \n\n  Physical exfoliation (yes this includes a washcloth and the Clarisonic!) should not be used more than 1-2x a week, and not if you have active acne, sensitive, flaking, or irritated skin.\n\n  Exfoliation will be beneficial if you have any of the following concerns (not comprehensive): zits, uneven texture, congestion, blackheads, whiteheads, dull skin, dry skin, [sebaceous filaments (SFs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/), etc.\n\n  Since AHAs/BHAs work at a lower pH to exfoliate, it's helpful to wait a few minutes before applying your next product (ie-moisturizer). If you don't have time to wait that length of time, at least wait until the AHA/BHA is dry.\n\n   Aim to use the AHAs in the PM--these cause photosensitivity. BHAs are more flexible, but when you can, do your exfoliation in the PM.\n\n  *BHA exfoliator recs (alcohol free)*\n\n  ~ Stridex Maximum Strength Pads aka Stridex in the red box (US/available on iherb or Vitacost): 2% salicylic. If known serious sensitivity to light fragrance/menthol proceed with caution. These tend to work fine for the majority of people\n\n  ~ Paula's Choice BHAs (Worldwide): Fragrance-free options, but pricier than stridex\n\n  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Various BHA products\n  \n  ~ Neutrogena 3 in 1 Oil Free Acne Stress Control Hydrating Acne Treatment (Various locations): 2% SA, light fragrance, contains 'cones.\n\n  *AHA exfoliator recs*\n\n  ~ St Ives Scrub Free Exfoliating Pads (US): 4-5% lactic acid. If very sensitive to fragrance or known fruit allergies, proceed with caution.\n\n  ~ Silk Naturals AHA Toner (US based but will ship to some international locations): 8% Lactic acid. Contains aloe. Fragrance-free.\n\n  ~ Paula's Choice AHAs (Worldwide): Varying concentrations of glycolic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir (Worldwide): 8-10% glycolic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Varying Glycolic/lactic/ AHA+BHA combos\n\n  ~ Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (US/International through iHerb): 10% glycolic acid, fragrance free\n\n  ~ Alpha Hydrox Swipes or Intensive Serum ( US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 14% glycolic acid, fragrance free\n\n  ~ MUAC Mandelic Serum (US/ ships internationally): 10% mandelic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ Avene Cleanance K (US/Canada/Europe/Aussie/possibly other locations): AHA/BHA product.  2% Lactic, 6% Glycolic, and 1% Salicylic. Slightly more expensive than the other recommendations. Fragrance-free.\n\n- **Moisturize**\n\n  Everyone needs a moisturizer, even those with oily skin!  A lot of the time at least part of the oil production is commonly due to dehydration (aka lack of moisture). \n\n  *Moisturizer Recs*\n\n  ~ Cerave Cream aka Cerave in the tub (US/Canada): Suitable for any skin type. Also works for the body. Fast absorbing, lots of humectants/ceramides. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/) thread has info on getting a pump lid for the jar.\n  \n  ~ Oilatum Natural Repair (UK): Suitable for any skin type. Similar to Cerave in the tub, though a tad more greasy. \n\n  ~ Cetaphil Lotion/Cream (Many locations worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Slightly greasier formula to Cerave in the tub. \n\n  ~ Vaseline  (Worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Good to add on top of moisturizer, or use alone to prevent water loss.\n\n  ~ EltaMD Intense Moisturizer (US): Vaseline alternative, non-sticky/day friendly option.\n\n\n- **Sunscreen**\n\n  This is your choice, just be sure to wear it everyday and it's at least SPF30 with high UVA protection. It's even more crucial  if you're using AHAs, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or you're on particular oral medications.\n\n  Proper amount for application is 2mg/cm^2. This is about 1/4 teaspoon (~1.2 mL) for the face alone. Reapplication should be every 1.5-2 hours (maybe even more depending on how nasty the UV index will be that day), and after every time you take a dunk in water. \n\n  Recommendations highly vary depending on location and type of finish you prefer. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15tuqd/for_those_interested_in_trying_out_new_susncreens/) sidebar link on sunscreens gives you all you need to know.  Also, try a board search and look on the first few pages of the sub.\n\n  Generally, if you are very sensitive or acne prone, you'll want to look for an all physical sunscreen or at least a physical/chemical combo.  All chemical sunscreens tend to cause stinging/breakouts/irritation for many people.\n\n- **Spot Treatments/Masks**\n\n  This will vary based on your skin type, personal preference as well. An effective spot treatment generally has antimicrobial/anti inflammatory properties. \n\n  *Spot Treatments to Consider*\n\n  ~ Benzoyl Peroxide cream/wash:  If in a wash, leave on skin for a few minutes before cleansing off to allow the BP to take effect. Side effects can be dryness/redness sensitivity. [2.5%](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1j4l9o/just_want_to_share_what_my_doctor_told_me_today/cbb2fen) is also A-OK to use, and can be just as effective as the higher concentrations with just less irritation.\n\n  ~ Sulfur ointment/cream: Tends to be less irritating than BP\n\n  ~ Tea Tree Oil: Should be diluted with a carrier oil to avoid a chemical burn. Avoid if prone to allergic contact dermatitis. Potent fragrance.\n\n  ~ Neem Oil: Very potent fragrance \n\n  ~ Clay masks: These will help clear pores and help bring some acne to a head.    Bentonite is the strongest, not great for dry/very sensitive skin, and should be mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV).   Kaolin/Rhassoul/French green are less drying and do not need to be mixed with ACV.\n__________________________________________________________\n\n**Order of Products**\n\nAs far as the order of your new and snazzy routine goes, it really depends, which is partly why we didn't include anything specific on here. \n\nThere's also a lot of flexibility in how/when you can use things (more pertaining to hydroxy acids).  Some people use multiple hydroxy acids (some in the form of a liquid) and/or have RX products that they need to use, so depending on the situation, the order and how often to apply things will differ. \n\nAn *example* routine with all of the things listed could go:\n\n**AM**\n\n-  Splash with water (unless feeling really grimy, use your cleanser)\n- Moisturizer\n- Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n- (If applicable) Remove makeup, preferably with an oil\n- Cleanser\n- Exfoliator\n- Wait a few minutes, at least til it dries\n- Moisturizer\n- Spot treatment (also can come before moisturizer, *do whatever works for you*)\n\nAgain, this is JUST an example, and not etched in stone. It all depends what other things you're using and whether or not you need to tweak order of things, or increase or decrease usage of products.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions or leave some more product recs!",

I picked up the Cerave cream, and applied it 'liberally' like it says on the package the first time. Turned me into a greasy sweaty mess. The next day I applied it much thinner, just a pea-sized amount or so, and it was still a little greasy. This morning I applied about half that amount and it finally felt good, but I'm wondering if that's enough to even be effective.\n\n2. Should I apply the Cerave everywhere? My nose is the only part of my face that really gets oily - does it still need to be moisturized? What about under my eyes? I've seen mentions here and there that you don't actually need a specialized undereye cream, but I'm kind of paranoid from years of hearing that regular moisturizer will destroy my eye region and make me look like a crone within weeks.\n\n3. Sunscreen - does it go under or over the moisturizer? Either way, how long should I wait between products?\n\nThank you so much for this beginner guide!",

And sorry if you already answered this question, there's a lot of comments so I may have missed something:\n\nEverything I've read says to apply treatment products before moisturizer, allowing it to dry in between. My problem is that I have really dry skin, and I find that my moisturizer is more effective if I apply it when my skin is still slightly damp. My current night routine is to pre-cleanse with jojoba to dissolve makeup, wash with cetaphil gentle cleanser, moisturize, allow that to dry and THEN apply neutrogena hydrating acne treatment gel (2% SA).\nThis routine has been great as far as keeping my skin moisturized and flake free, but I'm worried the BHA isn't working as effectively as it could to keep my pores unclogged. Since SA is oil soluble my theory is that it can still penetrate through the moisturizer but maybe I'm totally wrong about this.\n\nso my question is, is it worth it to moisturize while my skin is still damp or does moisturizing first reduce the effectiveness of the BHA too much?\n\n*edit for clarity",

I'd appreciate any feedback!  :)\n\nOk, so from what I've gathered, my skin type is sensitive, acne prone combo (it's oily in the T-Zone and dry everywhere else) and I have adult onset hormonal acne.  It means that the worst of my acne actually doesn't pop up in the oily areas, but instead along my jaw/cheeks/behind my ears.  I'm proscribed Spironolactone, which has cleared up the major papules, but I do still have quite a number of whiteheads. \n\nI've tested the Cerave Foaming cleanser and the Cerave in the tub for over a month at this point.  I really liked the way that my skin felt with them, but my skin gets tight after cleansing.  It does feel fine after I moisturize though.  So, does this mean it's too harsh?  I'm still a bit confused as to whether the tightness is expected before moisturizing?  \n\nNow that I've had a month of testing the products and know that they don't cause problems, I want to start introducing a chemical exfoliant as well.  I'm hoping this will help with the whiteheads I have.\n\nFrom my understanding, BHAs like Stridex are great for acne prone skin, but I'm also worried about the effects they have on sensitive skin.  Additionally - since my acne is hormonal will these even really affect it, other than to potentially damage healthy skin and re-aggrivate it?  Or am I not understanding hormonal acne?  Would I be better to start with lactic acid because of that gentleness?\n\nThanks in advance for any responses and opinions!

        "body": "Hello all, I'm very new to this subreddit and reddit in general. My acne was kind of bad in high school, but I thought it was cool to not care about my skin and I popped pimples often and didn't have any skincare routine. My parents did have me go to a dermatologist because they did care though. I don't think the dude knew what he was doing and despite trying some pills for a while I stopped taking those. I still use the BP and Differin now but at that time it's all I used.\n\nAnyway, I'm a junior in college now and for the most part I don't get that bad of acne anymore. Sometimes I'll wake up with 3-4 new pimples but usually it'll be just something small every day or two. I want to finish it completely though. My forehead is generally clean except for a few bumps near the eyebrows and above the nose. My cheeks don't often get new ones but this is where most of the redness and scarring is. New pimples mainly form around the jawline, sideburn area, and around the mouth (although since a few changes since discovering this two weeks ago, my chin has been great).\n\nI would like to continue the progress I've made, keep the new ones from forming (especially because I need to start shaving more often but I'm really scared to cause a breakout), and also get rid of the redness. I really think I'm still doing something wrong. My face looks like I have a bad sunglasses tanline and I want to eliminate that redness and start lightening the scarring because the scars have been there for a couple years and haven't significantly reduced in redness, although there still are occasional pimples in that area.\n\nMy routine is this: \nAM \n*Rinse with water \n*Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser (Began using a week or so ago from Clean and Clear Deep Action Cream Cleanser after reading here not to use products with alcohol in them. That seems to have helped as I haven't broken out this week.) \n*Prescription BP of 5% (Causes some flaking around the chin and mouth. Used to be much worse before I started using moisturizer and I would shave off the dead skin. It goes away after moisturizing though.) *Wait 15-20 minutes\n*CVS brand (comparable to Cetaphil) Moisturizing Lotion (I think I'm going to switch this out too, but I read here also to do one product at a time.)\nPM: \n*In shower\n*Same Fresh Foaming Cleanser from above. (On Saturday I use Clean and Clear Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub. I read not to exfoliate too often, I would do it more if it's recommended though. I've also only began this as of a week ago.) \n*Prescription Differin\n*Wait 15-20 minutes\n*Same moisturizer\n\nNotes: \n*I resumed taking Zinc supplements a week ago after stopping for 2 months \n*I never really use sunscreen on my face for fear of clogging pores/breaking out \n*My face generally gets greasy, on my cheeks especially, anywhere from 3-8 hours after washing. Sometimes I wake up with a greasy face and sometimes I don't. What's up with this? \n*I pat dry my face with a new paper towel after each wash to avoid irritation and using towels that touch other things. \n*I never really touch my face, I'm very conscious about it.\n\nSummary of questions: \n*How can I reduce the redness and not breakout?! (I've even been asked if I'm sunburned. That's gotta stop.) \n*How can I finish off the pimples that still form? \n*What should be corrected in my routine? \n*How can I shave without breaking out or mistakenly running over a forming pimple?\n*What is recommended for spot treatments of pimples that I notice forming?\n\nThanks!",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "The epilator and I have a lot of history.¬†\n\nMy mother got her first epilator when she was 18, a corded little device that was surprisingly functional for a ripe 30 years, only dying in 2019. It worked incredibly, in my opinion even better than the newer models. I also have a Silk Epil-7 bought about 7 years ago, and a Silk Epil-5 bought 2 years ago.\n\nI‚Äôm a hairy girl. I‚Äôve tried almost every single hair removal method there is, barring IPL and sugaring. Shaving is tedious, especially when the hair ends up growing back 12 hours later. Waxing is a lot more time-efficient, but if I‚Äôm paying 1200 a month, the least I would expect is for my skin to remain healthy, not bruised and burnt by the combination of extreme heat and damaged hair follicles. Depilatory creams stink, I could not subject myself to that often enough to remain as hairless as I enjoy being. I‚Äôve done laser trials, but after seeing friends with similar hair growth not getting any real results even after 16 sessions, I quickly gave up on that option too.¬†I‚Äôve even tried pumice stones ‚Äì I still have a scar on my leg from damage caused years ago.\n\nOver the past 7 years, I‚Äôve gone through a lot of trial and error in my adventures of hair removal. Each time, I‚Äôm always brought back to my trusty Braun Silk Epil. It unfortunately also took those 7 years for me to find out an epilation routine that *actually*¬†works, that doesn‚Äôt have me ending up in a painful cycle of ingrowth and bruises for the months that follow, and I‚Äôm here to share my findings with you!\n\n***How to choose an epilator:***\n\n* There are a few standard epilator types available. *Corded vs* *cordless, wet use vs dry*. I suggest getting cordless + wet use epilators because it maximizes the flexibility you‚Äôll have when using the device. This does not mean the corded ones are bad by any means, it‚Äôs just that you‚Äôll have to find a position close enough to a socket and bring each part of your body to the epilator instead¬†of being able to move the epilator around. A corded epilator also eliminates the chance of wet epilation, which can be a less painful option for some.¬†\n* Another parameter epilators may differ by is the *number of tweezers* on the rotating head. The more tweezers there are, the more hair will get pulled out per cm^(2). Fewer tweezers may take longer but will be comparatively gentler. I can‚Äôt give a recommendation here; I‚Äôm currently using and enjoying one with fewer tweezers (28), but the last time I used one with more¬†tweezers (40), I was a lot younger and didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing.¬†\n* Some epilators come with an extra *trimmer* attachment. If you don‚Äôt like using a razor to shave, the trimmer will be very useful, necessary even, when preparing to epilate. However, it can‚Äôt replace a razor if you plan on using it to shave normally. Over time, the efficacy of the attachment reduces, and it no longer gives a clean shave.¬†\n* More expensive models come with a plethora of *attachments* to choose from. While the exfoliating brush can be useful, I have only ever otherwise used the default attachment and the massage roller. Having the extra attachments isn‚Äôt necessary but could be useful to have.\n* The operational time/*battery life* also differs, but over time honestly, they‚Äôre all the same. With long-time use, the battery is bound to deteriorate. If this is an issue for you, a corded option would make more sense!\n* Other major differences I found between the older Braun model (Silk Epil-5) and the newer one (Silk Epil-7):\n   * The 5 has a press button, the 7 has a rotating dial. The button is a lot easier to turn the device on and off with one hand.\n   * The 7 has a flashlight on it, which helps see any missed-out hairs when epilating. This is extremely useful to me, but not a necessity for sure!\n\nBy default, I will *always* suggest Braun. They‚Äôve been in the hair-removal industry for decades longer than Philips (the only other commonly available epilator in the Indian market), and I believe their product quality is a lot more superior. Braun just really knows their stuff with these things.\n\n***Pre-epilation preparation***\n\n1. A week before epilating, *shave*: this is non-negotiable. Epilating only works when the strands are short, otherwise, you‚Äôll end up in severe pain with a shabbily done shave, since the hair is more likely to break than get pulled by the root. Shorter strands mean less tension and more efficient epilation. It took me years to figure this one out, but the day I did, it resulted in an infinitely less painful epilation process.\n2. *Exfoliate* religiously: another non-negotiable! The more dry, dead skin built up on your body, the more you will be prone to ingrown hairs. Exfoliating before epilating will bring as many hairs to the surface as possible, hence making the process, again, a lot more efficient. Any method works, so long as it is intensive and effective. Store-bought soft sugar scrubs are very useless though, I personally feel like they are only good for feel-good purposes. Dry brushing, coffee grounds, scrub bars, chemical exfoliation ‚Äì anything that will coax a hair to come to the surface will do.¬†\n3. Wait until your hair grows back to \\~*2-3mm* before planning to epilate. This could vary, and the minimum length is specific to each device, but this is generally the range.¬†\n\n***Process***\n\n(edit) The best time to do it is after a warm shower, so that your hair follicles are softer and your skin is clean!\n\n1. Make sure you have *a lot of time* *to spare*: the first time you epilate can feel like a never-ending process. It‚Äôs advisable to go slowly, covering only a small surface at a time, to get used to the sensation. I recently epilated for the first time since lockdown began ‚Äì it took 3 hours just to do my legs! Wet epilation takes a lot less time but personally is only efficient for me on my arms and underarms.¬†\n2. *Get comfortable*! If you‚Äôre doing it dry, find a space where you can lay down newspapers or a bed sheet (the hair can be a nightmare to clean otherwise), but also sit comfortably for a long duration. If you‚Äôre doing it underwater, soak in the bathtub, or bring a stool to sit on. Epilating can be nerve-wracking if you‚Äôre unfamiliar, so make sure you‚Äôre at ease in every other way possible.\n3. Keep *calming lotions* at hand: specifically, if you‚Äôre doing dry epilation. I keep Lacto Calamine or Aloe gel at hand, so I can keep applying to each section I‚Äôve completed before moving on to the next. An underwater equivalent of this would be rinsing with cold water. Another tip I have tried is numbing the area with ice cubes or an ice pack; it works for sure, but I‚Äôm too lazy to keep up with it.¬† Also, very random and very anecdotal, but a brief period when I was using Yardley/Nivea aerosol deodorants, epilating my underarms felt as painless as shaving.\n4. *Brace yourself*: take many deep¬†breaths. Turn it on, familiarize yourself with the sound and motion, and turn it off again. Only start when you‚Äôre completely prepared to.¬†\n5. *Hold skin taut*: this is the only thing that has helped me minimize the pain. The tighter the skin is, the less it will hurt! It‚Äôll also make it easier to navigate and maneuver the device, as it will minimize the crevices.¬†\n6. *Just start:* don't overthink it. Don't worry too much. Just get into it. I like to start at the ankle. A lot of guides I‚Äôve seen online don‚Äôt suggest this because it is the closest to the bone and hence could be more painful ‚Äì I don‚Äôt feel this way at all. It‚Äôs a smaller area to cover, and by the time it‚Äôs complete, I‚Äôm used to the sensation and my skin is already starting to numb.¬†\n7. Go in an upwards direction, *against the grain*. Going with the grain will just end up cutting the hair instead of pulling it out if the strand isn‚Äôt able to get properly caught in the tweezers.¬†\n8. *Take your time*, take breaks if needed.¬†\n9. Finish it up with a calming lotion. I find that Calamine helps to minimize the chances of bumps, and Aloe helps soothe inflamed skin and redness. Your skin has just been through a lot, it will be very raw and needs a lot of TLC until it heals.¬† ¬†\n\n***Aftercare***\n\n1. Be *as gentle as possible*: No harsh products, no tight clothing. I use Dove or Pears soap in the days after epilation and wear shorts or very loose pants to minimize the friction. (edit) Also, avoid hot water showers for a few days! Lukewarm leaning towards cold will help soothe and heal. \n2. *Intensive moisturizer*: Hair follicles can be rooted up to 5mm deep, which is why red dots under the skin from hair removal are so common. A super intensely nourishing moisturizer will be able to heal the skin from the inside out and prevent bruising. I use Cetaphil Restoraderm for the first few days after epilation when the skin is still raw.\n3. *CLEAN YOUR EPILATOR*. If you don‚Äôt the oil and sweat and grime will build up and infect your skin the next time you use it. Also, not cleaning the strands out of the rotating head will eventually weaken the device over time. It‚Äôs the reason my Silk Epil-7 became no longer functional, which is why I‚Äôm now diligent with it. This is where and why I always recommend getting a wet one- the simplest way to clean it is by submerging the head and turning it on in a bowl of warm slightly soapy water. You can then brush out any stuck hairs with the brush that comes with it.\n4. It's highly likely that a lot of hairs could‚Äôve been broken at the surface instead of being pulled out; these will grow back a lot quicker than the epilated hairs. It‚Äôs normal, do not worry.¬†\n\n***Maintenance***\n\n1. *Once the skin has healed*: I use the Palmer‚Äôs Cocoa Butter lotion after my skin has healed, in combination with the Skin Therapy body oil. Oil on wet skin, sealed with a thick lotion. The more moisturized your skin is, the less itchy regrowth will be.\n2. *Exfoliate regularly*. I exfoliate twice a day; the skin on my legs is super dry, and hence very prone to ingrowth. I dry brush every morning and use Vaadi soap in the shower at night. Once a week I do a coffee grounds scrub. I haven‚Äôt explored chemical exfoliation yet, but I‚Äôm keen on incorporating a Lactic Acid lotion into my routine.\n3. If the hair has started growing back, even if only a few days later, even if¬†only on a small portion of the total surface area, *epilate again*. A frequent epilation-exfoliation-epilation routine is key to maintaining in the long term. Epilating on the shortest possible strand length is ideal, and each time you epilate, it weakens the follicles; the extra time from shaving in between will give the follicle a chance to repair itself. And, honestly, the process feels SO satisfying when it's just for maintenance.\n\n***Dos*** ***and Don‚Äôts***\n\n1. **Do**: experiment with both in-shower and dry epilation. This can be a very personal preference. Certain parts of my body get epilated better underwater, while others do better dry.¬†\n2. **Don‚Äôt**: get intimidated by the sound! Yes, it‚Äôs loud and sounds like you‚Äôre operating heavy machinery, but a quick fix for this until you get fully immune to it is just turning on something to watch and stuffing earphones into your ears to drown it out.\n3. **Do**: take the time to get to know your device! Familiarize yourself with the different attachments that come with it, the different speeds, and what feels the best for you. It‚Äôs a learning curve for sure, but once you‚Äôve found a sweet comfortable spot, the process will become a breeze.\n4. **Don‚Äôt**: epilate your face if using retinoids. Take a week off before doing it, or else it will damage your skin. That being said- when I epilate my¬†upper lip, it takes weeks to grow back, double the time taken by threading.¬†(edit) Definitely numb with an ice pack/ice cube for this! \n5. **Do**: schedule out your maintenance routine. I get incredibly lazy with moisturization and dry brushing, especially when it‚Äôs hot and humid. But consistency is the only thing that works, you need to be religious about this. Scheduling out which days of the week and what time of the day makes it easy to follow and keep up with.\n6. **Don‚Äôt**: (NEVER) epilate without the pre-care steps. It‚Äôs okay if you end up shaving and must restart the process all over again, but never, ever epilate on long growth. It‚Äôll 1. be extremely painful 2. inefficiently¬†end up breaking a lot of the strands, and 3. leave bruises and marks that will take a lot of time and effort to heal.¬†\n7. **Do**: understand that, like with everything else, your mileage may vary. If it doesn't work for you, don't get discouraged and don't lose hope! You can put it away and revisit it when you're ready to. I have a relatively high pain tolerance when it comes to hair removal simply because of how long I have been doing this. If your tolerance is very low + your hair is dense and course, I would recommend exploring other options. However, I have seen a lot of people with low pain tolerance suggest taking a painkiller before epilating to make it easier.¬†\n8. **Don‚Äôt**: epilate right before going somewhere. It will leave your skin red and raw, so ensure you at least do it a day or two in advance. In my opinion, the best time to do it is at night, so you can slather on repairing lotions and your skin can heal while you sleep.\n9. **Do**: resist the urge to pick at any ingrown hairs that may occur. Have faith in your exfoliation process. The only true damage to my skin has happened because I refused to put down the tweezer.\n10. (edit) **Don't**: plan to epilate around your period, especially if you have low pain tolerance. This is a tip I randomly read somewhere online years ago and has stuck with me since. Your body will be more sensitive towards the end of your menstrual cycle, leading up to the beginning of the next one and the start of menstruation. Try planning it such that you epilate in the two weeks after the end of your period!\n\nI hope this helped! Feel free to ask me any questions below. May we all triumph on our quest for soft and smooth dolphin legs.¬†¬†",

Or if it has too much, it can have it shipped to the liver to be converted all the way back to glucose.\n\n\nWhy does it build up in the muscles?

        "body": "Lactic acid is an intermediate product in the chemical chain that's used to extract energy from food. \n\nBasically, animals have two main methods of extracting energy (respiration): Aerobic (requiring oxygen) and anaerobic (doesn't require oxygen). We prefer to use aerobic respiration - it's much more efficient and doesn't generate as many waste products.\n\nHowever, the aerobic respiration can only last for so long once you begin working beyond your normal rate - your lungs can only extract so much oxygen from the air, and it takes a certain amount of time for new oxygen to diffuse out into the rest of your body.\n\nOnce you deplete enough oxygen, your muscles switch over to anerobic respiration. Your body converts stored glucose into lactic acid, and your cells convert that lactic acid into energy. This is nowhere near as efficient as aerobic respiration - when you can use oxygen, one glucose molecule gives you 38 units of energy. When you can't, that same glucose molecule only gives you 2 units of energy.\n\nTo compensate, as you keep working without sufficient oxygen, your body absolutely floods your working muscles with lactic acid to give them the energy they need. However, beyond a certain concentration, lactic acid gives you that burning, aching feeling in your muscles. \n\nAnd that's why athletes train cardio; by working out more, they improve the functionality of their lungs. That's also why altitude training can be beneficial; training at altitude causes your body to produce extra red blood cells, which in turn allows your blood to absorb oxygen faster and carry more into your body. This allows well-conditioned athletes to work out longer without getting as sore and worn-out.",

It's a 3 carbon molecule that the body can use to make ATP for life and can export to other parts of the body to be used as fuel (and can be converted to bicarbonate). \n\nLactate is the mandatory end product of glycolysis. Glucose is converted to lactate by glycolysis. Glycolysis is always anaerobic, without oxygen consumed. Glycolysis is a very fast but inefficient way of making ATP. When there's plenty of oxygen the lactate and precursor pyruvate gets oxidized in the mitochondria to make more ATP very efficiently. This is called oxidative glycolysis. When there isn't enough oxygen and mitochondrial capacity, lactate builds up and eventually gets sent to the blood. \n\nIntensity of exercise determines how much glycolysis is needed and how much lactate is produced. Acidosis in the cell is the cause of the burn, not the lactate. The muscle fibers can buffer only so much hydrogen and excess lactate most likely leads to hydrogen disassociation from water.

    "body": "I thought I'd write a dumbed down guide to the practical application of brewing water chemistry since this topic seems to cause a lot of confusion and many homebrewers see it as a big hurdle to overcome.\n\nThis guide is written for homebrewers that have been holding back from getting into water adjustments due to confusion or intimidation regarding the topic. It will not go into great detail in water chemistry and acid/base equilibria. Instead, I will focus on learning how to use a spreadsheet to do the adjustments. You can become self sufficient in brewing water without diving into too much theory.\n\n**How Important is Water Chemistry?**\n\nWater chemistry is down the list of things you should worry about. Sanitation, fermentation temperature control, and yeast management are far more effective things to nail before tweaking water chemistry, according to John Palmer in How to Brew.\n\nOnce you've sorted those things out and removed any glaring flaws from your process, you can focus on adjusting water chemistry to improve your brews. This will allow you to \"season\" your beers to accentuate desired flavors and control the acidity of the final product so your beers will taste right. Both those things are important - it's more than just mineral profile.\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nBefore beginning, go to your homebrewing store and buy calcium chloride, gypsum, and either a pound of milled acidulated malt OR lactic acid. I got all of these for around $6 and they will last for many batches. If you are using tap water, you should also pick up campden tablets.\n\nNext, go download yourself the [EZ Water Calculator](http://www.ezwatercalculator.com/) spreadsheet. There is another more complicated spreadsheet available called Bru'N Water which works almost the same way but with more inputs and arguably a better pH estimation model. We'll use EZ today because it is so simple to learn, and then you can switch to Bru'N water or another calculator later if you'd like (Brewer's Friend works pretty well).\n\n**Using the Water Spreadsheet**\n\nWe will be using a simple 5 gallon BIAB witbier recipe as an example throughout this guide. [This image](https://i.imgur.com/MMeWXAs.png) shows how to fill out the spreadsheet. The steps are described in more detail below:\n\n1. *Water profile goes at the top*. If you are using bottled spring or RO water, check the label for the water profile. If you are using tap water, search for a water report online, or call the utility and ask for the Ca, Mg, SO4, Cl, Na, and alkalinity levels, or have the water tested. If you are using distilled water, leave everything at zero! Alkalinity may be given in ppm CaCO3 or ppm HCO3. EZ lets you enter either. I am using the profile from the 5 gallon jugs of spring water that I bought.\n\n2. *Fill out the mash water and sparge water amounts*. In this example, I have 7 gallons of mash water and no sparge water.\n\n3. *Fill out your recipe*. If you input any crystal malts, you'll have to fill out the Lovibond values as well. On the right, you'll see pH values calculated as you enter malts. As you'll see, the calculated mash pH is going to be in part a weighted average of these values. Roasted malts all contribute similarly so things like chocolate malt can simply go under the roasted malt category. \n\n4. *Input your salt additions*. In a subsequent section I'll show you how to figure those out.\n\n5. *Input acid additions*. EZ lets you input acidulated malt or lactic acid. In a subsequent section I'll show you how to figure those out.\n\n6. *Input your base additions*. I'll show you how to do this in another section but most recipes won't require this.\n\n**Water Chemistry Goals**\n\nNow, on to some basic theory. With brewing water chemistry, there are 3 things that you, the homebrewer, wish to accomplish:\n\n1. Remove chlorine and chloramine to prevent nasty band-aid flavored chlorophenols.\n\n2. Hit the target mineral profile.\n\n3. Get the correct mash pH.\n\n*Item 1* is dead simple - use filtered water or dissolve 1 campden tablet per 20 gallons of tap water. Done.\n\n*Item 2* is achieved with your brewing salts (calcium chloride and gypsum). \n\n*Item 3* is frequently missed by homebrewers, but it is critically important. Not only will this help with conversion and preventing tannin extraction, proper mash pH will lead to the right beer pH, which will result in flavors being properly delivered to your palate. High pH beer is dull and watery. Low pH beer is one dimensional. Determining the correct mash pH is highly dependent on many variables, but sticking between 5.2 and 5.6 will get you in the right ballpark.\n\nOnce you enter your water and recipe, you'll see a huge calculated mash pH value in the middle of the spreadsheet. If you play around with the inputs, you'll notice the following (try it!):\n\n- Adding darker malts brings the pH down.\n\n- Adding calcium (or Magnesium) brings the pH down.\n\n- Acid additions bring the pH down.\n\n- Adding chloride and sulphate have no effect on mash pH.\n\n- When alkalinity is low (< 40 ppm CaCO3), it doesn't take much to bring the pH down.\n\n- When alkalinity is high (> 150 ppm CaCO3), it takes a lot to bring the pH down.\n\nIt is important to remember that Calcium and Magnesium ions increase hardness which lowers pH. Sulphate and Chloride ions are for flavor only.\n\n**Salt additions**\n\nSalt and acid addition is done by trial and error. First, you must identify a target mineral profile and mash pH for your recipe. Here are some guidelines on target profiles if your recipe doesn't include one:\n\n- Calcium should be between 50-150 ppm.\n\n- Magnesium doesn't matter. You only need a little bit and the grains will provide it.\n\n- Chloride accentuates malt flavors. Sulphate accentuates hop flavors.\n\n- When in doubt, balance the chloride and sulphate levels. They don't need to be exactly equal for a balanced beer, but don't have one double the other.\n\n- For IPAs and styles where you want the hops to shine, swing the chloride/sulphate balance towards sulphate. IPAs might have 2,3,4,5, or more times as much sulphate as chloride. We would say that an IPA has a 4:1 sulphate to chloride ratio, for example (that's also a great starting point if you are brewing an IPA).\n\n- Add up the ppm of calcium, magnesium, sulphate, chloride, and sodium. Lighter bodied beers may be under 100 ppm total (more than 50% is Calcium!). Medium beers will be between 100 - 400 ppm. Getting above 500 ppm gives a real firm-structured beer. Exceeding the limits shown on the spreadsheet will result in gross minerally tasting beer, so be careful.\n\n- Don't look up the water profile for a specific city and try to match that. The brewers there probably aren't just using untreated water; they are also manipulating the profile.\n\nFor our witbier example, we want a balanced beer with some body. Therefore, I want something in the range of 200 ppm total minerals, with sulphate and chloride balanced, and at least 50 ppm of calcium. There are lots of options, but something like *75 Ca, 75 Cl, 75 SO4* with low Mg and Na levels should do the trick.\n\nNext, I'll start adding calcium chloride and gypsum to EZ (step 4). Both of these salts add calcium, but calcium chloride adds chloride whereas gypsum adds sulphate. After some mucking around, I ended up with 3 grams of gypsum and 4 grams of calcium chloride to [give this mineral profile](https://i.imgur.com/3mjndQz.png). \n\nNotice that I'm roughly where I want to be (Mg is low but the grains will add enough). Also notice that the mash pH has gone down because of the calcium, but it still isn't low enough. That means we must use acid additions to adjust the pH down further.\n\n**Acid Additions**\n\nHaving hit my water profile, it's time to add some acid. Witbier is pale, so I'll be targeting the middle of the pH range - about 5.40. Please keep in mind that estimating mash pH is tough to do and different spreadsheets use different models. Just because EZ says it will be 5.40 doesn't mean squat. However, if EZ says it will be 5.80, it's pretty safe to say you need some acid addition. The only way to nail 5.40 for sure is to test your mash with a pH meter and adjust acid on the fly.\n\nI don't have a working pH meter right now, so at least I am leaving myself some bumper room on each side. I can add either acidulated malt or lactic acid to my mash to bring the pH down. [Here is what happens when I add 5 ounces of acidulated malt](https://i.imgur.com/W6xe8yb.png). The mash pH drops to 5.52. As a rule of thumb, you don't want to add more than 3-4% acidulated malt to the grain bill, and I am sitting at about 3%. I could use some other acids or add a bit more acidulated malt, or add some more calcium. In this case, I may add another 1% acid malt and then brew.\n\n**Base Additions**\n\nMost of the time, you will find yourself trying to lower mash pH. If you are trying to brew a particularly dark beer with low alkalinity water, you may find that the pH prediction is too low and needs to be brought up. I typically don't encounter this problem, but if you do, you can add some baking soda to bring the pH up. EZ can handle this.\n\n**Some Notes on Water Source**\n\nGenerally, if you are getting your water from a surface source like a river, you can expect lower mineral content, lower alkalinity, but higher levels of chlorine/chloramine (especially in the summer). This water is easy to adjust but gives you the highest risk of undershooting pH in a dark beer.\n\nWater from a well is typical rich in dissolved minerals, high in alkalinity, but low in organic matter. You may find it difficult to get the mash pH low enough without some good acid addition. If that's the case, try cutting with bottled water to reduce the alkalinity.\n\nDistilled water basically has nothing in it. Having no alkalinity will make your water extremely sensitive to any grain or acid additions. Calcium, Magnesium, and base additions will act to increase the effective alkalinity and make things a little more stable.\n\n**Water Chemistry for Extract Beers**\n\nWhen your extract was made, the brewer took care of water chemistry for you (if it's good quality stuff). All the ions you need are in the extract, so if you mix it with distilled water you should theoretically end up with what the brewer intended. If you use water that has minerals in it, you'll be adding more to the extract wort.\n\nFor best results, use low mineral, low alkalinity water for your extract brews. Well water, for example, might be a bad choice due to the high mineral content and high alkalinity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere is a lot more to the theory of brewing water chemistry that I wanted to include, but it really makes more sense to focus on learning a spreadsheet first. Playing around with it will give you some intuition for how the brewing salts, grains, and acids affect your mash water.\n\nI am not a chemist. I am an engineer by profession, so my purpose is to do something useful while getting all the science and math wrong. Be nice and criticize constructively - we are in a glorious age of information where all homebrewers should have access to the tools and knowledge to optimize their brewing.\n\nHappy Brewing,\n\n-Lenny\n\nEdit 1 and 3: Thank you to /u/Nash_Rambler for gilding this post. I appreciate it and I'm glad you enjoyed it. Another thanks to an anonymous poster that gilded as well. The both of you are too kind. Now go drink some beer! \n\nEdit 2: My friend asked me a very good question about mineral concentration due to boil off. The minerals will become more concentrated during the boil. Typically I don't care as there is lots of room for play in the exact numbers. If you are doing a very small batch, you may want to consider the boil rate and adjust your mineral profile downwards while still hitting the desired mash pH. ",

After 2 brews, you should be focusing on water chemistry, or pH at the very least.

The only caveat I‚Äôd like to offer is that darker beers, primarily stouts, benefit more from the addition of pickling lime (Ca(OH)2) vice calcium carbonate (which is not very soluble in wort) or baking soda (which inadvertently increases sodium levels). Large proportions of roasted grains necessitate substantial alkali additions to maintain the mash pH in range, and unfortunately other alkaline compounds are not suitable for homebrewing purposes. At low levels, dissolved sodium can actually serve to increase the perception of maltiness, but beyond 50 ppm dissolved sodium, you will find beer starting to taste salty.",

I occasionally see those posts and I'm super happy when I do, but they're rare.\n\nI feel like 90% of the sub is just people fucking congratulating each other on how much money they have. Every post that gets on my feed is either some [Haul] or [shelfie] of literally hundreds of dollars worth of product and everyone just upvotes and says \"OMG drunk elephant üòç\" or \"I can't orgasm unless I smear Good Genes all over my body.\" \n\nWhy do shelfies and haul posts exist? They actually have nothing to do with skincare besides people just bragging about the products themselves. It's literally just bragging. It's one thing if the shelfie is like \"this is the only routine that works for my eczema/acne/etc.\" But they rarely are. They're usually 20+ products that cost $40-$100 a bottle. They're shilly and stupid.\n\nCan anyone tell me WHY drunk elephant is so good for their skin? What is the scientific benefit of Good Genes over The Ordinary's lactic acid treatment? Why the fuck are we jerking off to all this Korean skincare? Is there a scientific reason behind any of this or are we just vain and hoping to brag about how much money is on our face?\n\nI had hoped that the sub would help me sort through the consumerist bullshit of skincare and get to the science behind it but it's kind of become the opposite.\n\nAlso I swear to got if one more person says \"eat healthy and drink tons of water!!!!\" when asked how their skin cleared up I am going to have an aneurysm.",

The shelfies and hauls are tedious af and the before/after pictures of people with flawless skin who ‚Äújust started drinking more water‚Äù are actually infuriating. \n\nAs far as the Asian thing, though, I *will* say that I have found some Asian skincare products really are better than American ones (I‚Äôm from the US). Their sunscreen options are particularly better than the American ones I‚Äôve tried, in terms of not breaking me out and layering well under makeup. I think Asian skincare generally places more emphasis on hydration than Western skincare does, especially in the acne world, which is obviously a mind-blowing thing to whatever teenager comes to SCA with cracked oily skin after a 10-step drying routine. (You can see this with the difference in toners, for example, being a hydrating step in Asian routines instead of a cleansing/actives step in American routines.) I also think Asian cleansers are more upfront about their pH levels, sometimes even putting them in the cleanser name, and pay more regard to actual science in that way.\n\nThat being said, after years and years of battling severe hormonal acne and trying every product under the fucking sun, the only Asian product in my daily routine is my sunscreen (Etude House Sunprise Milk). I‚Äôll use a few layers of a hydrating toner (Gokujyun) if I am really struggling with some flakiness. Both these products are actually quite inexpensive and definitely less costly than DE or even some higher-end drugstore brands. \n\nBirth control is what fixed my skin, because hormones were what was wrong with my skin, and no product was ever going to fix it.

    "body": "Serious question ‚Äî how on earth do elite runners complete a full marathon (42.2 km) in just under 2 hours? That‚Äôs like running at a 2:50/km pace the entire time. I just ran my first 10K today in 1 hour 20 minutes (avg pace: ~8:00/km) and felt like I gave it everything I had.\n\nI even did a negative split ‚Äî picked up pace in the second half and pushed my obese body hard toward the end ‚Äî but still can‚Äôt wrap my head around how someone can hold that kind of speed for four times the distance I did.\n\nAre their lungs made of titanium? Do they not feel lactic acid? Genuinely curious ‚Äî what kind of training or physiology or even psychology allows that?",

He had pacers, a car driving in front at the right pace, a mapped out perfectly flat parcours etc. anything under 2:30 is absolutely wild. As a long term endgoal a sub 3 marathon is one realistic for many with lots and lots of training and dedication, but also one many that set it will never achieve.\n\nBut that aside experience does help. I remember when i started to get the hang of running i could do 11k in an hour and 5 minutes or so. After this I was a trainwreck. Throat closing up and stuff, my knees hurt for more than a week. Then after keeping up consistent efforts for a while the pace that i found to be impossible te keep up with started to feel more and more relaxed. At this point 10k at half marathon pace takes about 48 minutes, with a pr at 42 minutes. Its a far shot still from the times elite athletes will be running, but it does put into perspective what i concidered to be fast when i started out. It will really grow on you.\n\nAnd besides also lots and lots of genetics. The world top in distance running consists of actual genetic outliets (who are possibly also on epo).

    "body": "*‚ÄúSo, Levi, let me get this straight - Noah just so happened to be recording a voice memo*¬†***exactly***¬†*when the home invasion started? That‚Äôs one hell of coincidence, given that my brother barely used his cellphone to text, let alone record himself.‚Äù*¬†Sergeant Landry barked from my office doorway, face flushed bright red.\n\nTo be clear, that wasn‚Äôt¬†*at all*¬†what I was trying to say, but the maniac had interrupted me before I got to the punchline.\n\nHe moved closer, slamming a meaty paw on my desk to support his bulky frame as he positioned himself to tower directly over me. Although it‚Äôd been over a decade since I‚Äôd last seen him, Landry hadn‚Äôt changed one bit. Same old power-drunk neanderthal who communicated better via displays of wrath and intimidation than he did the English language.\n\nI leaned back in my chair in an effort to create some distance. Then, I froze. Stayed completely still as if the man was an agitated Rottweiler that had somehow stumbled into my office, scared that any sudden movements could provoke an attack.\n\nAs much as I hated the man, as much as I wanted to meet his gaze with courage, I couldn‚Äôt do it. Pains me to admit it, but I didn‚Äôt have the bravery. Not at first. Instead, my eyes settled lower, and I watched his thick, white jowls vibrate in the wake of his impromptu tantrum as I stammered out a response.\n\n*‚ÄúLike I said, Sergeant, we found the Sheriff‚Äôs phone in the mail today, hand delivered in a soggy cardboard box with no return address. Message scribbled on the inside of the box read ‚Äúvoice memo‚Äù, and nothing else. So, believe me when I say that I‚Äôm just telling you what I know. Not claimin‚Äô to understand why, nor am I sayin‚Äô the Sheriff‚Äôs disappearance and the recording are an unrelated coincidence. It‚Äôs only been ten or so hours. Everything‚Äôs a touch preliminary, and I‚Äôm starting to think the recording will speak for itself better than I can explain it.‚Äù*¬†I mumbled.\n\nI waited for a response. Without my feeble attempt at confidence filling the space, an uneasy quiet settled over the room. The silence was heavy like smoke, felt liable to choke on it.\n\nFinally, I mustered some nerve and looked Landry in the eye. The asshole hadn‚Äôt moved an inch. He was still towering over me, blocking the ceiling lamp in such a way that the light faintly outlined his silhouette, creating an angry, flesh-bound eclipse.\n\nThe sweltering Louisiana morning, coupled with the building‚Äôs broken A/C, routinely turned my office into an oven. That day was no exception. As a result, sweat had begun to accumulate over Landry - splotches in his armpits, beads on his forehead, and a tiny pocket of moisture at the tip of his monstrous beer-gut where gravity was dragging an avalanche of fat against the cotton of his overstuffed white button-down. The bastard was becoming downright tropical as leaned over me, still as a statue.\n\nDespite his glowering, I kept my cool. Gestured towards my computer monitor without breaking eye contact.\n\n*‚ÄúI get it. Ya‚Äô came home, all the way from New Orleans, because Noah‚Äôs your brother, even if you two never quite got along. Believe it or not, I want to find him too. So, you can either continue to jump down my throat about every little thing, or I can show ya‚Äô what we have in terms of evidence.‚Äù*\n\nLandry stood upright. His expression relaxed, from an active snarl to his more baseline smoldering indignation. He pulled a weathered handkerchief from his breast pocket, which may have been the same white as his button-down at some point, but had since turned a sickly, jaundiced yellow after years of wear and tear. The Sergeant dabbed the poor scrap of cloth against his forehead a few times, as if¬†*that*¬†was going to do fuck-all to remedy the fact that the man was practically melting in front of me.\n\n*‚ÄúAlright, son. Show me,‚Äù*¬†he grumbled, trudging over to a chair against the wall opposite my desk.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief and turned my attention to the computer, shaking the mouse to wake the monitor. I was about to click the audio file, but I became distracted by the flickering movement of wings from outside a window Landry had previously been blocking.\n\nJudging by the gray-white markings, it looked to be a mockingbird. There was something desperately wrong with the creature, though. First off, it hadn‚Äôt just flown by the window in passing; it was hovering with its beak pressed into the glass, an abnormally inert behavior for its species. Not only that, but it appeared to be observing Landry closely as he crossed the room and sat down. Slowly, the animal twisted its head to follow the Sergeant, and that‚Äôs when I better appreciated the thing jutting out of its right eye.\n\nA single light pink flower, with a round of petals about the size of a bottle cap and an inch of thin green stalk separating the bloom from where it had erupted out of the soft meat of the bird‚Äôs eye.\n\nThe sharp click of snapping fingers drew my attention back to Landry.\n\n*‚ÄúHello, Deputy? Quit daydreamin‚Äô about the curve of your boyfriend‚Äôs cock and play the goddamn recording. Noah ain‚Äôt got time for this.‚Äù*\n\nLike I said - Landry was the same old hate-filled, foul-mouthed waste of skin. The used-to-be barbarian king of our small town, nestled in the heart of the remote southern wetlands, had finally come home. The only difference now was that he had exponentially more power than he did when he was the sheriff here instead of his younger brother.\n\n*Sergeant Landry of the New Orleans Police Department*¬†\\- what a nauseating thought.\n\nI swallowed my disgust, nodded, and tapped the play button on the screen. Before the audio officially started, my eyes darted back to the window.\n\nNo disfigured mockingbird.\n\nJust a light dusting of pollen that I couldn‚Äôt recall having been there before Landry stormed in.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n***Voice Memo recorded on the Sheriff‚Äôs phone***\n\n**0:00-0:08:**¬†Thumps of feet against wood. \n\n**0:09-0:21:**¬†No further movement. Unintelligible language in the background. By the pitch, sounds male.\n\n**0:22-0:35:**¬†Shuffling of paper. Weight shifting against creaky floorboards. Noah‚Äôs voice can finally be heard:\n\n*‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶what the hell is all this?‚Äù*\n\n**0:36-0:52:**¬†More unintelligible language.\n\n**0:53-1:12:**¬†Noah speaks again, reacting to whoever else is speaking.\n\n*‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt believe you‚Ä¶and I won‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶‚Äù*\n\n**1:13-1:45:**¬†One of the home invaders interrupts Noah and bellows loud enough for his words to be picked up on the recording. Their voice is deep and guttural, but also wet sounding. Each syllable gurgles over their vocal cords like they are being waterboarded, speech soaked in some viscous fluid. They can't seem to croak more than two words at a time without needing to pause.\n\n‚Äú*READ. NOW. YOU READ‚Ä¶WE SPARE‚Ä¶CHILDREN. OTHERWISE‚Ä¶THEY WATCH. NOT‚Ä¶MUCH TIME‚Ä¶NOAH.‚Äù*\n\n**1:46-2:01:**¬†Silence.\n\n**2:02-2:45:**¬†Shuffling of paper. Can't be sure, but it seems like the Sheriff was reading a prepared statement provided by the intruders. Noah adopts a tone of voice that was unmistakably oratory: spoken with a flat affect, stumbled over a few words, repeated a handful of others, etc.\n\n*‚ÄúHello, \\[town name redacted for reasons that will become clear later\\],*\n\n*We are your discarded past. The devils in your details. Your cruel ante‚Ä¶antebellum.*\n\n*We-we may have been sunken deep. You may have thought us gone forever. But we are the lotus of the mire. We have risen from the mud, from the depths of the tr‚Ä¶trench to rect‚Ä¶rectify our history.*\n\n*You may have denied our lives, but you will no longer deny our deaths. We will lay the facts bare. We will recreate your greatest deviance, the em-emblem of your hideous nature, and you will watch us do it. You will watch, over and over again, until your eyes become dust in your skulls, and only then will we return you to the earth.*\n\n**2:46-4:40:**¬†Noah recites one more sentence. His voice begins to change. It's like his speech had been prerecorded and artificially slowed down after the fact. His tone shifts multiple octaves lower. Every word becomes stretched. Unnaturally elongated. Certain syllables drone on for so long that they lose meaning. They become this low, churning hum - like a war-horn or an old HVAC system turning on.\n\nI believe the sentence Noah said was:\n\n*‚ÄúWe have hung; you will rot.‚Äù*\n\nBut it sounded like this:\n\n*‚ÄúWwwweeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaaavvveeeeeeee huuuuuunnnnngggggg.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúYooooooooooooouuuuuuu wiiiiiilllllllllll rrrrooooooooooooooootttt.‚Äù*\n\n\\- - - -\n\nAbout a minute into the humming, Landry sprung to his feet, eyes wide and gripping the side of his head like he was in the throes of a migraine.\n\n*‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with your computer?? Turn that contemptible thing off!‚Äù*¬†he screamed.\n\nI scrambled to pause the recording, startled by the outburst. Took me longer than it should have to land the cursor on the pause button. All the while, the hum of Noah saying the word¬†*rot*¬†buzzed through the speakers.\n\nFinally, I clicked, and the hum stopped.\n\nI tilted my body and peered over the monitor. Landry was bent over in the center of my cramped office, face drained of color and panting like a dog, hand still on his temple.\n\nTruthfully, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded him keeling over. I liked picturing his chest filled with clotted blood from some overdue heart attack. Wasn‚Äôt crazy about it him expiring in my office, though. The stench would have been unbearable.\n\n*‚ÄúYou need me to call an ambulance or -‚Äù*\n\nLandry reached out an arm, palm facing me.\n\n*‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù*\n\nHe retrieved the handkerchief again, swiping it more generously against his face the second time around, up and down both cheeks and under his chin. Once he was breathing close to normal, Landry straightened his spine, ran a few fingers through his soggy, graying comb over, and threw a pair of beady eyes in my direction.\n\n*‚ÄúWhat happened to the end of the recording? Did the file, you know, get corrupted, or‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†he trailed off.\n\nI‚Äôm not confident Landry even understood the question he was asking. The man was far from a technological genius. I think he wanted me to tell him I had an explanation for what happened to Noah‚Äôs voice at the end.\n\nI did not.\n\n*‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶no. The file is fine. The whole phone is fine,‚Äù*¬†I said, mentally bracing for the onslaught of another tantrum.\n\nNo anger came, though. Landry was reserved. Introspected. He looked away, his eyes darting about the room and his brow furrowed, seemingly working through some internal calculations.\n\n*‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre sure they didn‚Äôt find his body? I‚Äôve seen house fires burn hot enough to turn a man‚Äôs bones to ash,‚Äù*¬†he suggested.\n\n*‚ÄúNothing yet. At the very end of the recording, after Noah stops speaking, you can hear what sounds like a body being dragged against the floor, too. I think they took him. We have our people over there right now sifting through the ruins...you know, just in case.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúAlright, well, keep me posted. I‚Äôll be out of town for the next few hours.‚Äù*\n\nI tilted my head, puzzled.\n\n*‚ÄúBusiness back in New Orleans, Sergeant?‚Äù*\n\nHe lumbered over to the door and twisted to the knob.\n\n*‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm going to look around the old Bourdeaux place. Call it a hunch.‚Äù*\n\nI‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt turn around as he left. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to mask my revulsion.\n\nHow dare he, of all people, speak that name?\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nAn hour later, I was stepping out the front door of the police station and into the humid, mosquito-filled air. There was an odd smell lingering on the breeze that I had trouble identifying. The scent was floral but with a tinge of chemical sharpness, like a rose dipped in bleach. Whatever it was, it made my eyes water, and my sinuses feel heavy.\n\nBrown-bag in hand, I took a right once I reached the sidewalk and began making my way towards the community garden. My go-to lunch spot was a bench next to a massive red oak tree only two blocks away. Shouldn‚Äôt have taken more than ten minutes to walk there.\n\nThat day, it took almost half an hour.\n\nAt the time, I wasn‚Äôt worried. I didn‚Äôt sense the danger, and I had a reason to be moving slowly, my thoughts preoccupied by what Landry had said as he left my office, so the peculiarity of that delay didn‚Äôt raise any alarm bells.\n\n*I‚Äôm going to look around the old Bourdeaux place. Call it a hunch.*\n\n*‚ÄúWhat a fucking lunatic,‚Äù*¬†I whispered as I lowered myself onto the bench.\n\nIn retrospect, my voice was slightly off.\n\nI hadn‚Äôt even begun to peel open the brown bag when a wispy scrap of folded paper drifted into view, landing gently on the grass like the seed heads of a dandelion, dispersing over the land after being blown from their stem by a child with a wish.\n\nThen another.\n\nThe second scrap fell closer, wedging itself into the back collar of my shirt, tapping against my neck in rhythm with a breeze sweeping through the atmosphere.\n\nThe scraps of paper continued raining down. A few seconds passed, and another half-dozen had settled around me.\n\nI tilted my head to the sky and used my hand to shield the rays of harsh light projected by the midday sun, attempting to discern the origin of the bombardment. There wasn‚Äôt much to see, other than a flock of birds flying east. No one else around, either. The community garden was usually bustling with some amount of foot traffic.\n\nNot that day.\n\nI reached my hand around and grabbed the slip still flapping against my neck and unfolded it. The handwriting and the blue ink appeared identical to the message scribbled on the box that Sheriff's phone arrived in earlier that morning.\n\n*‚ÄúMeet me in the security booth. Come now.‚Äù*\n\nOnly needed to read two more to realize they all said the same thing.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nMy run from the bench to the security booth is when I first noticed something was off.\n\nThe security booth was a windowless steel box at the outer edge of town; no more than three hundred square feet crowded by monitors that played grainy live feeds of the six video cameras that kept a watchful eye on the comings and goings of our humble citizens. Four of those cameras were concentrated on what was considered ‚Äútown square‚Äù. From the tops of telephone poles they maintained their endless vigil, looking after the giant rectangular sign that listed the town‚Äôs name and population, greeting travelers as they drove into our little island of civilized society amongst a sea of barren, untamed swampland.\n\nWhen I was a teen, the town invested in those extra cameras because the sign was a magnet for graffiti that decried police brutality. I would know. I was one of the main ringleaders of said civil activism. Never got caught, thankfully. An arrest would have likely prevented me from joining our town‚Äôs meager police force down the road.\n\nIt was all so bizarre. It¬†*felt*¬†like I was running. Felt like I was sprinting at full force, matter of fact. Lactic acid burned in my calves. My lungs took in large gulps of air and I felt my chest expand in response.\n\nAnd yet, it took me an hour to arrive at the security booth.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm no long-distance runner. I don‚Äôt have a lot of endurance to hang my hat on. That said, I‚Äôm perfectly capable of short bursts of speed. Those five hundred yards should have taken me sixty seconds, not a whole goddamn hour.\n\nEvery movement was agonizingly slow. Absolutely grueling. It only got worse once I neared that steel box, too. My muscle fibers screamed from the strain of constant contraction. My legs seethed from the metabolic inferno.\n\nBut no matter how much my mind willed it, I couldn‚Äôt force myself to move any faster.\n\nThe door to the booth was already open as I approached, inch by tortuous inch. I cried out from the hurt. Under normal circumstances, the noise I released should have sounded like ‚Äú*agh‚Äù*: a grunt of pain.\n\nBut what¬†*actually*¬†came out was a deep, odious hum.\n\nBefore I could become completely paralyzed, my sneakers crawled over the threshold, and I entered the security booth. I commanded my body towards a wheely chair in front of the wall of monitors, which was conspicuously empty. I ached for the relief of sitting down.\n\nAs I creeped in the direction of that respite, I heard the door slam behind me at a speed appropriate for reality. I barely registered it. I was much too focused on getting to the chair.\n\nTook me about five minutes to traverse three feet. Thankfully, once I got to aiming my backside at the seat, gravity mercifully assisted with the maneuver. On my toes and off balance, my body tipped over and I collapsed into the chair, sliding backwards and hitting the wall with a low¬†*thunk*.\n\nWith the door closed, I seemed to recover quickly from the cryptic stasis. My motions became smoother, faster, more aligned with my understanding of reality within a matter of minutes. Eventually, I noticed an object lying on the keyboard below the monitors. A black helmet with a clear visor and an air filter at the bottom.\n\nIt was an APR (air-purifying respirator) from the fire station.\n\nInstinctively, I slipped it on, which only took double the expected time. There was an envelope under it, and it was addressed to me. I opened the fold, pulled out the letter, and scanned the message. Then, I put my eyes on the four monitors that were covering the town‚Äôs welcome sign.\n\nLooked up at the perfect moment.\n\nEveryone was there, and the show was about to begin.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nThe Bourdeaux family was different.\n\nThey were French Creole, and their ancestors inhabited the wetlands that surrounded our town long before it was even a thought in someone‚Äôs head. Arrived a half-century before us, give or take. Originally, their community was fairly large: two hundred or so farmers and laborers who had traveled from Nova Scotia and Eastern Quebec after being exiled as part of the French and Indian War, looking to dig their roots in somewhere else.\n\nOvertime, though, their numbers dwindled from a combination of death and further immigration across the US. And yet, despite immense hardship, The Bourdeaux family remained. They refused to be exiled once again.\n\nFor reasons I‚Äôll never completely understand, our town feared The Bourdeaux family. I think they represented the wildness of nature to most of the townsfolk. Some even claimed they practiced black magic, putting their noses up to God as they delved into the forbidden secrets of the land. Goat-sacrificing, Satan-worshipping, heathens.\n\nOf course, that was all bullshit. I knew the Bourdeaux family intimately. I was close friends with their kids growing up. They were Catholic, for Christ‚Äôs sake. They did it a little differently and sounded a little differently when they worshipped, but they were Christian all the same. But, when push came to shove, the truth of their beliefs was irrelevant.\n\nBecause what is a zealot without a heathen? How can you define light without its contrasting dark? There was a role to be filled in a play that‚Äôs been going on since the beginning of time, and they became the unlucky volunteers. People like Sergeant Landry needed a heathen. He required someone to blame when things went wrong.\n\nBecause a God-fearing man should only receive the blessings of this world, and if by some chance they don‚Äôt, well, there‚Äôs only one feasible explanation: interference by the devil and his disciples.\n\nSo, when Landry‚Äôs firstborn died of a brain tumor, back when he was just¬†*Sheriff*¬†Landry, he lost his goddamn mind. Within twenty-four hours, the last five members of the Bourdeaux family, three of which were children, were pulled from their secluded home in broad daylight and dragged into the center of town.\n\nDespite my tears and pleas, they received their so-called divine punishment, having clearly cursed Landry's child with the tumor out of jealousy or spite. I was only ten. I couldn‚Äôt stop anyone.\n\nThe rest of my neighbors just silently watched the Bourdeaux family rise into the air.\n\nNot all of them were smiling, but they all watched Landry, Noah, and three other men pull on those ropes.\n\nAnd when I was old enough, I applied to work at the station.\n\nSince I couldn‚Äôt stop them then, I planned on rooting out the cancer from the inside.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nWhat I saw on those monitors was the exact same event in a sort of reverse.\n\nThere was a crowd of people gathered in the town square. Most of them weren‚Äôt moving, stuck in various poses - some crouching, some walking, many of them looked to be running when they became paralyzed. A gathering of human-sized chess pieces, so still that the birds had begun to perch on the tops of their heads and their outstretched arms.\n\nBut no matter their pose, they were all facing the back of the town‚Äôs welcome sign. \n\nAs I inspected each of the pseudo-mannequins in disbelief, I noticed the first of five people that¬†*were*¬†moving. It was a child, weaving through the packed crowd like it was an obstacle course. They were wearing a tattered dress with a few circular holes cut out of it, big enough to allow pink flowers the size of frisbees passage through the fabric, from where they grew on the child‚Äôs skin to the outside world. The same type of flower I saw growing out of the mockingbird‚Äôs eye earlier that morning. One over her sternum, one on her right leg, and two on her left arm, all bouncing along with the child as she danced and played.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt see the child‚Äôs face. They were wearing a mask that seemed to be made of a deer‚Äôs skull.\n\nA tall, muscular man entered the frame, walking through the crowd without urgency. Multiple, gigantic flowers littered his chest, so he hadn‚Äôt bothered with modifying a shirt to allow for their unfettered bloom. His bone mask had large, imposing antlers jutting out from his temples. There was an older man slung over his shoulder, motionless. Even though the monitors lacked definition, I could immediately tell who it was.\n\nLandry.\n\nFive slack nooses were draped over our town‚Äôs large rectangular sign. Four of them already had people in them. The rightmost person was Noah.\n\nThe muscular man slid Landry into the last empty noose like a key into a lock. He backpedaled from the makeshift gallows to appreciate his work. After staring at it for a few minutes, he turned and beckoned to the rambunctious child and three others I couldn‚Äôt initially see on the screen: a pair of older twins and a mother figure walking into frame from the same direction the man had arrived, all with their own cancerous flowers and bone masks. \n\nThey gathered together in front of the soon-to-be hanged. The man wrapped two long arms around his family, the twins on one side, the mother and the small child on the other. They marveled at their revenge with reverence, drinking in the spectacle like it was a beautiful sunset or fireworks on New Year's Eve.\n\nFinally, the man whistled. I couldn‚Äôt tell you at what. Maybe he whistled at a larger animal infected with their flowers, like a black bear or a bobcat. Maybe he whistled at a flock of birds, coordinated and under their control. Maybe he whistled at some third option that my mind can‚Äôt even begin to conjure. I didn‚Äôt watch for much longer, and I didn‚Äôt drive through the town square on the way out to see for myself. I took the back roads.\n\nWhatever was beyond the camera‚Äôs view on the other side of our town‚Äôs sign, it was strong enough to hang all five of them. Landry, Noah, and three others lifted into the air.\n\nThe rambunctious child clapped and cheered. The mother figure kissed the man on the cheek.\n\nThe rest of the town just watched. Paralyzed, but conscious. Which, the more I think about it, wasn‚Äôt much different from the first time around.\n\nBut the muscular man wasn‚Äôt sated. He refused to give Landry and his compatriots a quick death.\n\nNo, instead, he signaled to whatever was pulling the nooses by whistling again, and the five of them were lowered back to the ground.\n\nA minute later, he whistled, and they were hanged once more. Another recreation of the past that would never truly be enough to fix anything, but the patriarch of the Bourdeaux family would not be deterred. He was dead set on finding that mythical threshold: the point at which vengeance was so pure and concentrated that it could actually rehabilitate history.\n\nAfter watching the fourth hanging, I made sure my gas mask was on tight, and I ran out of the security booth. It was late evening when I opened the metal door, and I could no longer smell the air: no scent of a rose dipped in bleach crawling up my nostrils.\n\nI assumed that meant I was safe.\n\nStill, I did not remove the mask until I had reached New Orleans.\n\nI slept in a motel, woke up a few hours later in a cold sweat, and started driving north before the sun had risen.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n**The Letter:**\n\n*‚ÄúHello Levi,*\n\n*I‚Äôm not sure what we are anymore.*\n\n*Dad was the first to wake up.

    "body": "On Friday, June 11th 2021 03:27:48 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time) /u/innsource made a post requesting a recipe.  A recipe that requires a very particular set of ingredients.  Ingredients that make beer a nightmare for people like you (and me).\n\nI don't really like nightmares, and I sort of like making crazy recipes (even if they may not work, but I try!), so I really wanted to give this a go.  What I have below is not me blowing smoke up your ass.  It's a legit attempt at something that covers all of the basis for what a \"good\" New England Double Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Tropical Salted Caramel Double Dry Hopped Extra Oat Cream Vanilla Milkshake Chocolate Raspberry Icecream Sour White Stout Infused with Mint, Hibiscus and Truffle oil beer should be.\n\n---\n\nSo let's break this down first into some keywords and flavor profiles commonly associated with them and see if we can't do some combining:\n\n* New England - A less defined hop bitterness but more defined aroma and flavor.  Smoother mouthfeel.  Will likely be more opaque\n* Double - Higher ABV\n* BBA - Bourbon Barrel aged\n* Imperial - Higher ABV\n* Tropical - (hops?  fruit?)\n* Salted Caramel - what it is\n* DDH - Arguable, I prefer the \"2 dry hop additions\" definition\n* Extra - ?\n* Oat - Oats (maybe oat cream = oat milk?)\n* Cream - Lactose\n* Vanilla - Vanilla\n* Milkshake - Usually just lactose\n* Chocolate - Chocolate (particular malts like pale chocolate, carafa II, cacao etc.)\n* Raspberry - The fruit\n* Sour - Lower pH, higher TA, lactic acid\n* Icecream - ehhhhh, we'll go lactose-y\n* White Stout - sweeter coffee blonde with chocolate and vanilla\n* Mint, Hibiscus, Truffle oil\n\nSo now that we have, you know, *some* flavors we're going for let's look at malts.\n\nSo I think between the Double, BBA, Imperial, and maybe extra qualifiers we're going to want to focus on this being a big boy.  Let's do 12% coming out of the FV.  We'll also target 5.5 gallons.\n\nI start a lot of sentences with \"So\" apparently.\n\nNow the tricky part is that we want this to be sort of a NE style sour White Stout...basically.  This is actually kinda ok and workable.  I think based on those descriptors I almost want to say that we should use Pilsner malt.  It just feels right, I have a gut feeling.\n\nAlso I'll say this for the recipe, I'll add %'s but my efficiency goes to pit when I brew these higher OG beers so I'm targeting closer to a 60% efficiency with this.\n\nSo let's rock out 17 pounds of that to start.  We also need to make sure that we get some wheat and oats (for the NEIPA, though this is debatable, but I think it plays into white stout too).  So let's do 4 pounds of white wheat malt, and 3 pounds of flaked oats.  Because I'm going to suggest Philly Sour later (despite around a 9% abv tolerance which I bet we can crush) let's do .5# of corn sugar too.  And lactose because...lactose.\n\nSo we're looking at:\n\n* 17# Pilsner (70.6%)\n* 4# White Wheat (15.6%)\n* 3# Flaked Oats (11.8%)\n* 1# Lactose\n* .5# Dextrose (2%)\n\nBecause we need to cover \"salted caramel\" I think that what we want to do maybe mash with just a bit of extra water and caramelize-ish one gallon of our first runnings.  After mashing for about 20 minutes collect a gallon and start heating that bad boy up and get it boiling.  We'll just sparge right into the boiled runnings after the full hour is up.  We'll do salt later.\n\nAlright, so hops.  What hops are sort of vanilla-y, citrusy, fruity, may go well with high sugar content, and may age well.\n\nMy very first thought would be to go for some Lotus hops followed by a more traditional Citra.  I don't think we want to get too complex here because we have a lot of adjuncts we're going to be messing with too.\n\nSo considering we want some \"BBA\" to this, how are we going to utilize the hops?  How are we going to not completely screw up something \"New England-ish\" while also aging a little?  Let's brainstorm!  We'll look at the BBA stuff and then the hops next.\n\nSo as many of us know, hop forward beers tend to be very sensitive to oxygen.  In general, this makes IPAs a poor candidate for aging typically.  So....what if we do the \"aging\" as it's fermenting and split the difference?  We can try to get as much of the wood and bourbon flavor into the beer as we can while oxygen really isn't present, and then let everything mellow just a little bit while the beer is carbonating in a keg.  This is a legitimate question, I don't really know, but I also don't think it's the worst solution here.\n\nI say let's go for it.\n\nBut what bourbon?  Or!  Do we cheat?  Because we're targeting something more vanilla forward what if we use Vanilla Crown?  Is it a little fake?  Sure.  It's not bourbon!  Well...yeah.  Is it a little sweet?  Well that's probably for the best in this beer.  In general I find that if I tell people what flavors they need to find in my beer they'll find them, so if we just tell people this is \"bourbon barrel aged\" I think they'll bite.  So how do we do it?\n\nWell!  It just so turns out that we need to include mint, hibiscus, and truffle oil as well.  I think it's time that we consider an oak spiral / honeycomb in a tincture.  But let's go big.\n\nSo let's get a tincture going about a month before fermentation will be complete.  One 5\" spiral / honeycomb is typically enough for 5 gallons of beer.  If you find that your wood can fit into the bottle as is (heh) take your bottle of crown and pour one out for your weird ass beer (into your mouth, preferably), then another, and then maybe another.  Clear some room out.  If the wood can't fit into the bottle then find a container that can hold your whole fifth.  With all of that liquor combine a single 5\" oak spiral, 2oz. mint, 6oz, hibiscus, and whatever truffle oil you feel comfortable putting in.  Hell yeah.\n\nAlright, so now we do hops.  I don't actually think this is going to be quite as big of an issue as whatever that tincture we're going to add is going to do.  With the raspberry we're adding as well it's possible that a lot of the more delicate flavors that the hops are going to add are going to get overshadowed a bit so I think we go a little lighter than a standard New England.  I don't think that we do any bittering hops, but we do do some whirlpool and dry hop additions.  I think that we also add our wood and tincture when we do our second dry hop (remember DDH!).\n\nSo, we're using Lotus and Citra.  Let's keep it simple.  2oz of each hop whirlpooled at 160F for 30 minutes, 1oz of each hop added at high krausen, 1oz of each hop added day 5 or 6.  I'm targeting a time where fermentation isn't going to be complete, but doesn't have a ton of time left.  Philly is odd in that it creates a lot of the lactic acid up front, sort of pretends to stall for a bit, and then kicks back up and produces most of the ethanol.  I think somewhere around day 5-6 with a large pitch and some oxygen would be a good time.  We're going to add most of our adjuncts here too because, again, we're really trying not to expose this to too much oxygen.\n\nSo around day 6ish we're going to add our last dry hop addition, 5# raspberries, 2 vanilla beans (notice that these are not in the tincture), and .#5 of cacao nibs that have been toasted in the oven for about 10 minutes (or until your house smells like brownies), and...I really have no idea how much of the tincture.  Toss that wood piece in and add like 1/4 of the bottle?  If it needs more bourbon go ahead and just add some Buffalo Trace.  Excellent.\n\nWe also need to cover \"tropical\".  I'm actually sort of a fan of straight pineapple juice in secondary.  Crack open a 29oz. can and pour 'er in.  Oh that's sexy.\n\nLet all of that sit until about 3 days after fermentation completes and then closed transfer it to a keg.  I normally burst carb, but I think this one will need some time to become the beer that it's father knew it could always be.  Set it at your normal serving pressure and give it a few weeks, serve, and enjoy.  Or don't, I didn't make this you did, that's not on me.\n\nSo let's break it down into a more concise recipe:\n-----\n\n* 17# Pilsner (70.6%)\n* 4# White Wheat (15.6%)\n* 3# Flaked Oats (11.8%)\n* 1# Lactose\n* .5# Dextrose (2%)\n\nAnd then...\n\n* Mash at 148F for 60 minutes.\n* 20 minutes in collect 1 gallon of wort and start to boil it.  Aim for like a quart of thick syrup when you're ready to sparge.\n* Mash the rest for 40 more minutes.\n* Boil for 60 minutes with no boil additions\n* Whirlpool with 2oz Citra and 2oz Lotus for 30 minutes at 160F\n* Chill to pitching temp (let's roll with mid-high 60's)\n* If you have the ability, oxygenate with O2 and then pitch 3 (!) packs of Philly Sour.  It may be a bit of an overpitch but I'm counting on a healthy fermentation blowing the 9% normal attenuation out of the water.\n* At high krausen dry hop with 1oz Citra and 1oz Lotus\n* After six days dry hop with 1oz Citra and 1oz Lotus as well as:\n  * Add (slowly) 5# raspberries\n  * Add 2 vanilla beans\n  * Add 8oz toasted cacao nibs\n  * Add 1/3 of tincture?  1/4?  I really don't know.  Less??  Palmer help us.\n  * Dat wood\n  * Salt Bae the beer\n* Let fermentation complete (maybe up to another week) and then closed transfer it to a keg\n* Slowly carb it over the course of a week or two\n* Serve and flex your amazing homebrew muscle\n\nIf you brew this PM me and I will pay for you to send me and /u/innsource some bottles.\n\nUnless there are like thousands of you who are that mad.  Then it's first come first served.",

        "body": "Hello all!  I‚Äôm a credentialed MPH epidemiologist currently working in 3 covid-specific roles, so here‚Äôs a summary of the facts we can consistently evidence:\n\n1) Reinfection is currently shown as possible, but the standard set for assessing a supposed reinfection (meaning a person completely cleared covid, and then contracted the virus anew, not a relapse of an enduring/dormant initial infection) is a minimum of 6-8wks must exist between the symptomatic or PCR clearing of CV+ status and the acquisition of a new CV+ diagnosis.  The time it takes for IgG & IgM antibodies to drop below the protective threshold is 1-3 months, with an average of 45 days.  So flaring up symptoms before 45 days from initial infection‚Äôs resolution means that the initial infection is relapsing.  Testing CV+ within 45 days means the initial infection has not fully cleared.  Neither meets diagnostic criteria to indicate a new infection is occurring.\n\n2) ‚ÄúImmunity‚Äù is not statistically borne out as well-enough evidenced to affect diagnostic and prescriptive practice.  Does a person with high antibody count immediately post-infection have immunity from reinfection for an average of 45 days?  Likely, but the risks associated with endorsing reliance on an inconsistently evidenced protective factor is vastly outweighed by the risks of accidental reinfection in the wake of recovery from a vicious virus.  Don‚Äôt risk your health on a hope.  Keep quarantining from contacts who are within their exposure window, as there is nowhere near a promise that you are safe!\n\n3) Unicorns and armchair experts: I mean this in the nicest possible way, but you aren‚Äôt special!  Statistically speaking, you aren‚Äôt the one hyper-outlier that is actively infected for 150 days.  You aren‚Äôt the one magical medical-defying case of some new post-viral syndrome.  Outside of the placebo and hypochondriac effect on your perceived wellbeing, your essential oils and keto diet almost certainly won‚Äôt change the course of this illness any more than they would cancer.  Rest, follow medical advice, and try to focus on other things rather than how hyper-measurement correlates with elevating pulse rates and tachycardia.\n\n4) Vaccines: coronaviruses are historically resistant to vaccine efficacy, despite being annoyingly stable.  This jerk will circulate for awhile unabated, doubly so if you don‚Äôt adhere to base health edicts.  Wear your masks, wash your hands, and recognize that being reckless 1 time can easily invalidate all the time spent being cautious.  Call out your shitty relatives who brag about hugging at church to stick it to dirty libruls, shame your coworkers who inexplicably lean in and lower their masks to talk to you.  If you want a light at the end of the tunnel, quit overloading the circuits with idiocy and tripping the breakers!",

A few weeks later she was feeling better with no symptoms, tested negative twice and went back to work. There she *may* have been exposed again (elderly home with tons of positive cases) and 2-3 weeks later she developed again the same symptoms. Test was positive.\n\nI know the general consensus is that those negative tests were \"false\" negatives and she never truly got rid of the v√≠rus. I do find it odd that she went from completly asymptomatic with negative tests to symptomatic with a positive test (plus there's a possibility she was exposed again). I'm not sure what is worse though, the fact some (all?) people can be re-infected after a few weeks, or the fact that you can have multiple relapses (and possibly be contagious again?) even if symptoms get better and you test negative.",

I lost my sense of taste and smell. The very next day I got ‚Äúallergy‚Äù type symptoms where I was congested and sneezing a little bit. That lasted 2 days then disappeared. Currently I feel back to normal except I still can‚Äôt taste or smell anything.

I should still social distance and wear a mask because I could potentially get it again. \nI asked her about antibody tests because my roommate took that and it came back positive. (The roomy didn‚Äôt even know he had Covid in the first place) She told me there is so little information about this virus that she can‚Äôt say that having antibodies even guarantees a person is immune. Also that a person who has had Covid might not even test positive for the anti body test. She recommends my roommate still social distances and play it safe.

    "body": "Hi all. 27(M) here. Skin type is pretty normal. No issues really. Occasional spots and whiteheads. Had a minimal skincare before. Used to just wash my face with black soap and moisturised with jojoba oil. Introduced a toner and liked how my skin felt and looked. Got intrigued with Korean skincare so did some research. Heard about the multi-step routine. Loved it. Until I started developing acne. Did more research. Bought more products to fix my ‚Äòacne‚Äô. More and more acne followed. Spiralled. Had a box full of skincare that I didn‚Äôt even want to think about using. Still wanted to buy more products though. \n\nWent to US for a trip. Only brought Laneige Cream Skin Refiner + Aloe gel + TO Squalane + Sunscreen. Got curious with Differin. It helped with acne. What also really helped was giving my skin a break from all those ‚Äònecessary products‚Äô. Acne now gone. It was never acne. I used too much too quickly and my skin was telling me to stop but knowledge dictates that this product is good for this problem so it should work and so I kept going. Learned my lesson the hard way. Hundreds spent. Lots of PIH. But now I know. \n\nTLDR: Your skin is smart. Cleanse, hydrate, moisturise, protect. \n\nCurrent Skincare: \n\nBanila Co Cleansing Balm (PM) \n\nHada Labo Hyaluronic Cleanser (PM) \n\nDermatory Hypoallergenic Toner (AM/PM) \n\nCos de Baha Azelaic Acid (AM/PM) \n\nDIY Vit C Serum (AM) \n\nThe Inkey List Niacinamide (PM) \n\nTretinoin 0.025% (PM) \n\nHydroquinone 4% (PM spot treat) \n\nCerave Cream (AM/PM) \n\nAquaphor (PM) \n\nRohto Skin Aqua (AM) \n\nPS yeah it doesn‚Äôt look minimal at all, but I listen to my skin. If I feel like I could do without a product then I skip it. Most days I just tone, moisturise and SPF. \n\n**Cleansers (1st and 2nd cleansers)** \n\n‚Ä¢\tPyunkang Yul Cleanser (500ml) ‚Äì BIG bottle. Lasted me ages. Mild. Does what it says. None stripping from what I could remember. WNRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tHada Labo Foaming Cleanser ‚Äì Love this cleanser. Non-drying for a foaming cleanser. Not sure what the pH is but my skin never felt stripped. Affordable as you can buy refills. HG \n\n‚Ä¢\tCosrx Good Morning Gel Cleanser ‚Äì Too drying for me. WNRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tTosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash ‚Äì Drying but made my skin smooth. WNRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tHeimish Cleansing Balm ‚Äì My first cleansing balm. Loved it at first but I was eventually put off by its fragrance to a point that I was using more than I needed just so I could finish it. WNRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tThe Face Shop Rice Cleansing Oil (Both Light & Rich version) ‚Äì I loved the rich version during winter. Both are fragranced. Both are straightforward cleansing oils. WRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tDHC Cleansing Oil ‚Äì Heavy weight cleansing oil. Make sure you emulsify it well with water. None stripping. WNRP simply because I find it expensive. \n\n‚Ä¢\tBanila Co Cleansing Balm ‚Äì Love. A little bit goes a long way. Fragranced. WRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tMuji Cleansing Oil ‚Äì It‚Äôs a cleansing oil lol. Does what it says. No fuss. No fragrance. WRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tMissha Super Off Cleansing Oil Peel Off ‚Äì Lightweight cleansing oil. Big bottle. WRP \n\n**Toners/Toner pads/Essences** \n\n‚Ä¢\tNeogen Real Ferment Micro Essence ‚Äì Hydrating. Light. Fragrance free. Didn‚Äôt irritate my skin or anything. Tried it a long time ago. Will update once I‚Äôve tried my new bottle. For now, WNRP because price. \n\n‚Ä¢\t Cosrx Green Toner Pads ‚Äì It‚Äôs ok. Not that hydrating. Good for a quick toner pad masking. Scented. WNRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tNeogen Real Cica Pad ‚Äì I believe this contains PHA. Skin smoothing. I liked it enough RP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tInnisfree Green Tea Skin ‚Äì Smelled citrusy. Hydrating for someone with normal-oily skin. WNRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tThank You Farmer True Water Deep Toner ‚Äì Slightly viscous for a toner. Fragranced. Did not like this product as I feel like it broke me out. Did not finish. WNRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tMissha Time Revolution FTE ‚Äì Love this. My skin just drinks it up. RP \n\n‚Ä¢\tDermatory Hypoallergenic Moisturising Toner ‚Äì LOVE this too. Affordable (300ml) Lots of good ingredients (Allantoin, Cica, Honey!). Hydrating and moisturising. Fragrance free. ‚ÄòClean‚Äô. ?HG \n\n‚Ä¢\tHada Labao Shirojyun Lotion ‚Äì Did not like. Didn‚Äôt notice any skin brightening effect. WNRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tHada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion ‚Äì Bomb. Different HA weights + urea. Hydrating and skin smoothing. HG \n\n‚Ä¢\tBenton Aloe BHA Skin Toner ‚Äì Skin loving ingredients while mildly exfoliating. RP \n\n‚Ä¢\tPyunkang Yul Essence Toner ‚Äì Viscous. Calming. I like. RP \n\n‚Ä¢\tLaneige Cream Skin Refiner (Normal/Mist) ‚Äì Love this. Multipurpose. Hydrating and moisturising. Often carry it with me when travelling to keep my skincare minimal. HG \n\n‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm From Mugwort Essence ‚Äì Slightly viscous. Took a while to absorb. Soothing. Expensive. WNRP. ‚Ä¢\tCosrx Snail Mucin Essence ‚Äì Sticky. Magical. Affordable. RP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tKikumasamune High Moist ‚Äì Affordable. Big bottle. Unpleasant sake smell. Did nothing for my skin. Very watery. Contains placenta(!). WNRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tAcwell Licorice Toner ‚Äì Smells good. Very hydrating. HG at one point. RP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tCosrx AHA BHA Toner ‚Äì Meh. Neither hydrating nor exfoliating. WNRP. \n\n**Serums/Ampoules** \n\n‚Ä¢\tInnisfree Green Tea Seed Serum ‚Äì Hydrating and plumping. Can be oily Fragranced. RP \n\n‚Ä¢\tCos de Baha Azelaic Acid Serum ‚Äì Aloe based. Hydrating. I feel like it has helped with my PIH. \n\n‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm From Ginseng Serum ‚Äì FrAgRanced. Hydrating. Feels good when you apply on skin. Brightening. WNRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tNacific Fresh Herb Origin Serum ‚Äì Also fragranced. Oil water combo. Didn‚Äôt notice any brightening effect. Oily residue that didn‚Äôt quite absorb in my skin. WNRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs Skin Power 10 Ampoule (WH/PO versions) ‚Äì Nada. Chucked it. WNRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tPyunkang Yul Moisture Ampoule ‚Äì Labelled as an ampoule but instruction tells you to use it as the last step of skincare. Cooling effect. Clean ingredients. Good for warmer weathers. Can‚Äôt tell the difference between this and the PKY Balancing Gel.\n\n ‚Ä¢\tCosrx Mela 14 Ampoule ‚Äì Contains niacinamide. No brightening effect noted. Small bottle. Discontinued I believe. WNRP\n\n ‚Ä¢\tKlairs Freshly Juiced Vit C ‚Äì Hated it. Weak percentage of Vit C. Oxidises quickly if you‚Äôre not careful. Oily. Sat on my skin. Gave me blackheads I swear. WNRP \n\n**Emulsions/Gels/Creams**\n\n ‚Ä¢\tA‚ÄôPieu Madecassoside Cream ‚Äì Love. Fragranced. Calming. WRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tAromatica Aloe Gel ‚Äì Smells like rose if you like it. Big bottle. Loved this as a mask or as a moisturiser. HG aloe. \n\n‚Ä¢\tCosrx Oil Free Moisturiser ‚Äì Some wizardry here. Very moisturising. Liked it enough but WNRP ‚Ä¢\tCosrx Hyaluronic Acid Cream ‚Äì Loved this too. Very sticky but moisturising. WRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tSur Medic+ Azulene Soothing Cream ‚Äì Very calming. Feels moisturising but sometimes dries down tight on my face. Expensive. WRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tIlliyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream ‚Äì Heck yeah. Love this cream. I alternate between this and Cerave Cream in the tub as my HG moisturiser. \n\n‚Ä¢\tA‚ÄôPieu Madecassoside Gel ‚Äì I love this too. Hydrating for a gel. I‚Äôd say it might be too heavy for those with oily skin. Calming. WRP\n\n‚Ä¢\tNature Republic Aloe Gel ‚Äì Who hasn‚Äôt tried this amirite? Couldn‚Äôt stand the fragrance tbh. Still cracking through to this big tub lol. WNRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tLaneige Water Sleeping Mask ‚Äì Oh MY GOD. Whats the hype about. Fragranced. Made my skin feel tight even though I have layered products under this. WNRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tBanila Co Dear Hydration Sleeping Mask ‚Äì Very moisturising sleeping mask. WRP. ‚Ä¢\tCosrx Snail AIO Cream ‚Äì Made my skin feel tight. WNRP.\n\n‚Ä¢\tCosrx Rice Sleeping Mask ‚Äì Lots of people love this. Idk why. It‚Äôs not bad but nothing to brag about imo. \n\n‚Ä¢\tCosrx Oil Free Aloe Cream ‚Äì Lightweight. Good for summer. No real occlusive so you might find yourself feeling dry.

BRB RP RN \n\n‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs Skin Hyaluronic Eye Cream ‚Äì It‚Äôs ok. Took forever to finish, mostly because I don‚Äôt really care for eye cream. WNRP. Sheet/Wash off Masks \n\n‚Ä¢\tInnisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask 2X ‚Äì Love the cooling. Contains glycolic so it‚Äôs exfoliating as well. RP \n\n‚Ä¢\tSkinfood Black Sugar Honey Mask ‚Äì Love. Fragranced. I call this the poor man‚Äôs I‚Äôm From Honey Mask. WRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm From Honey Mask ‚Äì LOOVE. Super moisturising. I leave it on for an hour and my skin feels amazing. HG \n\n‚Ä¢\tInnisfree Jeju Volcanic Color Clay Mask (Green one) ‚Äì Did nothing. WNRP. ‚Ä¢\tI‚Äôm From Mugwort Mask ‚Äì Also love. Calming, cooling, soothing. Pores size look minimised.

WRP \n\n‚Ä¢\tDewytree Aqua Deep Mask ‚Äì Same as above. WRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tDewytree Help Me Honey Mask ‚Äì Smells of honey. Love it. Very hydrating.

Still WRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tBIORE UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen ‚Äì Lovely. Shiny finish. Goes to quickly. WNRP if I‚Äôm honest, simply because I‚Äôm after more economical sunscreens. \n\n‚Ä¢\tMISSHA All-around Safe Block Daily Sun ‚Äì Moisturising. Whitecast. WNRP. \n\n‚Ä¢\tLaneige Air Light Sunstick ‚Äì Convenient to use when youre out and about. Sticky finish. Lasts forever. WNRP because sticky means icky lmao I just mean that dust and dirt more likely to stick to your face. \n\n‚Ä¢\tCosrx Aloe Soothing Sun Cream ‚Äì Lovely. Moisturising. Too heavy for me. WRP.\n\n **Lip Care** \n\n‚Ä¢\tLaneige Lip Sleeping Mask ‚Äì It‚Äôs a lip balm. I love it. RP \n\n‚Ä¢\tKlavuu Lip Sleeping Mask ‚Äì Also a lip balm. I also like it.

The consistency and finish reminds me of the the biore watery essence but it's less stinging, more hydrating and even lighter in texture! I bought it on a whim and to this day I don't really see many reviews of it out there, except for [this one from Jolse](http://m.jolse.com/article/official-review/8/53635/) which I feel is pretty on point!

    "body": "I don't know if everybody is familiar with the lactate test, therefore I thought I share it:\n\nGenerally we do the lactate test to locate the aerobic and anaerobic threshold of the runner. \n\n- The aerobic threshold is where the body starts to accumulate more lactic acid than it can break down. Below this you can continue your running basically forever and above this there is a certain point in time (4-5 hours - generally marathons are run around this point), where you need to stop.\n- The anaerobic threshold is where the body accumulates so much lactic acid that it is basically impossible to maintain that effort for more than a few minutes. \n\nSo the process of the test it that the runners give the first sample with the resting lactate levels, then they start running at a very slow pace and after 3-4 minutes they give the next sample. They have 1 min rest and they continue with the next pace level. Basically they continue increasing the pace every 3 mins and they always give a blood sample. The trainers do the blood test and look for the point where their lactate level increases at least 1 mmol comparing to their base level. This will be their aerobic threshold.\n\nThen they continue increasing the pace where they cannot continue anymore and that will be the anaerobic threshold.\n\nFrom the test we know which heart rate zone and paces are good for the individuals to train in and improve their fitness. There is no winner or loser of the lactate test, instead we get a good idea how our body works and how we can maximise our performances.\n\nEdit: the importance of knowing our zones is, that you need to train in specific zones to improve. The biggest mistake most runners make is to train in the not too hard not too easy effort, basically right between the two thresholds. This does not effectively train neither your aerobic nor your anaerobic fitness. General rule of thumb is that you need to train your long runs in your aerobic zones, and in other sessions doing some interval 5-10 repetitions for short durations in the anaerobic zones.",

I also found this quote from him,\n\n\"Then, OP's entire notion that they are scammers is based on the this brochure [https://personal-care.evonik.com/product/personal-care/downloads/downloads/sk-influx.pdf](https://personal-care.evonik.com/product/personal-care/downloads/downloads/sk-influx.pdf) where they state that *free* fatty acids take 3.5% of the mix. But at the same time say that it has ‚Äú2.5% active matter‚Äù, which would be less than fatty acids alone.\n\nBut in the product data sheet [https://imgur.com/a/PA5jJcB](https://imgur.com/a/PA5jJcB) and their INCI ingredient list *free* fatty acids are not listed at all. And numbers of the ceramides, cholesterol and Phytosphingosine do add up to be 2.5%. The only source of fatty acids in this mix would be emulsifier - Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate. And this means that fatty acids are not *free*, they are part of ester between lactic acid and lauric acid. As far as I know, the content of brochures and ads is not regulated, but INCI ingredient lists are.\"\n\nA tweet from a cosmetic chemist posted on another similar subreddit: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/sfordl/cosmetic_chemist_formulators_thoughts_on_the_rsa/)\n\nI seriously don't know what to believe. But apparently ceramide skin care products were developed in Korea, and thus it's likely that products created there are much more effective than the brands in the U.S that seem to follow one method of ceramide creation\n\nKorean brand examples supposedly following this ratio: ZEROID, Atopalm, RealBarrier & Derma:B.\n\nWhat's the consensus on this?\n\nEdit: Guys, I never said this was fact. I'm surprised by the amount of people reading this and 100% agreeing without doing any research to prove/falsify.",

Also, I believe they registered their inci so it does not reflect every component of the product, for example, the preservative is mentioned in their paperwork but not on their inci.\n\n(ETA-evonik also makes two versions of this product, version one is higher %wt but not vegan. Version V is 2.5% and vegan)\n\nI have no reason to believe they're lying, but I don't know any way to easily assay and confirm this.

Somewhere along the line a  pharmaceutical  company put a patent on it so no other company can sell that exact ratio in the U.S. and you have to get it through insurance.

No . Different skin concerns need different treatment... someone with eczema would need fatty acids more than ceramides.... someone one with damaged skin barrier might need ceramide and someone with dehydrated skin might need lipids... There are so many expensive moisturizer with 1% or more pure ceramides ....if not following the ratio made that product useless then brands wouldn't be going through the hassle of producing such high grade ceramides in their products to begin with .",

I can sweat, I can exercise, I can get hot without worrying. Only once every couple of months when I get hot I get slight CU tingles, like a gentle reminder of how excruciating this used to be.\n\nI wanted to come back and highlight the most important result from those literature reviews back then: **CU usually clears on its own.** We are the extreme cases, and with that comes extreme suffering. But despite that, most likely, most cases of CU clears on its own. This is why this subreddit doesn't keep growing a lot. This is why many posters eventually become silent. Their CU clears, and they can move on, living normal, happy lives.\n\n**Most likely, you'll be okay. Stay strong.**\n\n----------\n\nOriginal post:\n\nMolecular biology student here - and sufferer of cholinergic urticaria. Here are some pet theories and theoretical treatments in clear language.\n\nI love to read and summarize papers in my spare time. My this year's literature list alone has been a wild ride of 1500+ theories, meta-analyses and clinical trials. And I happened to develop cholinergic urticaria this year as well. I hate it.\n\nSo, as I did for various other topics and papers, I went deep into the literature on cholinergic urticaria. By now it has been 100+ hours of reading and 100+ studies read.\n\nQuick summary: nobody really knows. There is no validated medical theory of why CU develops, at all. And no treatment that really works. We all have tried antihistamines; I envy the lucky ones for whom they actually work well.\n\n**Quick overview of this post:**\n\n1. **Introduction (right here)**\n2. **Theories of what causes CU**\n3. **Possible cures for CU**\n4. **The links to my sources and my full analysis**\n\n**My theories of what causes cholinergic urticaria**\n\nI developed these theories via modifying current theories of the pathology of CU or via creating my own theories or hybrids. They are all based on studies done in CU patients. They may apply to us all. For both of them there is good evidence, but they could be disproven or insufficient. Good old science.\n\nThese are quick descriptions of how the theories work. I link my detailed write-up and the sources below.\n\n*Prelude: How sweating works*\n\nSweating in healthy humans is induced via the hypothalamus sensing high body temperatures, and then sending neural signals via sympathetic nerves to the skin's sweat glands. These nerves are cholinergic (they use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) and the receptors on sweat glands are called muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Acetylcholine released by neurons in the vicinity of a sweat gland binds to its receptors and stimulates sweating. The sweat is produced in the sweat gland within the skin and brought to the skin surface with rather long, thin, hollow ducts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcnkpel6u1261.png?width=396&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6584f5b97f4389e0a2556b227866ad2c30d1533\n\n# Hypothesis 1: Poral Occlusion Theory\n\nBasically, the long ducts of your sweat glands that should bring sweat to the surface may be occluded due to keratin plugs or unknown goo.\n\nSweat gland duct occlusion leads to accumulation, rupture and spillover of sweat in the dermis, causing inflammation, pain & weals due to the various inflammatory substances contained in normal human sweat which is meant to be outside of the body. The reaction to the intradermal sweat may be exacerbated due to autoimmune anti-sweat-IgE antibodies and sweat hypersensitivity.\n\nThe keratin plugs may happen due to low skin turnover, bacteria on your skin producing goo or keratin hyper-synthesis - the ultimate cause is unclear as of now.\n\nScientific support: In a nutshell, there have quite a few cases where researchers clearly found these plugs. Especially so in CU patients which present with hypohidrosis (low sweating). But these plugs have not always been found, and it is yet debated. But Poral Occlusion Theory offers an elegant and simple theory of why cholinergic urticaria forms. It may be a sub-form of CU which not everybody has.\n\nThis theory gives us a ton of theoretical options to treat CU. See below!\n\n# Hypothesis 2: Few Receptor Theory\n\nAcetylcholine is released by sympathetic nerves stimulated via the hypothalamus' response to high temperature, like in any non-symptomatic individual. Because of low muscarinic receptor expression at the sweat glands, the hypothalamus' signal intensifies (there is no temperature decrease) and the quantity of acetylcholine in the area of a sweat gland increases. As mast cells also express muscarinic receptors, high local cholinergic activity eventually leads to their degranulation, causing inflammation, pain & weals. Pain is also caused via the acetylcholine directly stimulating pain receptors.\n\nA quick graphic:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8lknfzku1261.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b8a2116075deeae0e165a537682a103d043bcf\n\nLow muscarinic receptor expression could be caused by low general fitness, as highly fit humans sweat more readily and easily. However, there appear to be no studies on how exercise affects muscarinic receptors.\n\nIn turn, the cause may not be low sweat gland receptors numbers but high mast cell muscarinic receptor expression, making them vulnerable to degranulation & weal formation even at low local acetylcholine levels.\n\nThe current evidence strongly points at there being too few receptors in various cases of CU. They all have significantly fewer receptors on their sweat glands than health individuals have, making proper sweating very hard.\n\n**Maybe both are right?**\n\nWe are highly complex biological machines: It is likely that both theories are able to explain some parts of the process leading to CU.\n\n# Hypothesis 1 + 2: A synthesis\n\nSynthesis: Both 1 and 2 happen simultaneously. There is duct occlusion leading to both significant sweat spillover as well as acetylcholine spillover. Acetylcholine spillover directly stimulates pain nerves, while it degranulates mast cells too. Sweat, which is per se inflammatory if it isn't outside the body, and mast cell degranulation cause the weal and inflammation. This could also explains the common sweat sensitivity seen in CU: The body develops antibodies targeted at the sweat within the skin, as it should not be there.\n\nThere are only a few papers providing any attempt at a complete theory of cholinergic urticaria. This would explain the lack of current medical knowledge about CU in the scientific community..\n\n**Some other factors that may be involved in causing cholinergic and other chronic urticarias:**\n\n* Sweat sensitivity is often involved. I would argue it is rather a consequence of CU than a major true cause of it.\n* Hypothyroidism may be involved. There are several cases of urticaria associated with thyroid antibodies and low thyroid hormones.\n* Epstein-Barr or Herpes simplex virus infection may be involved. In some urticarias, medications against theses viruses were ably to completely alleviate symptoms.\n* Parasites may be involved. Think of these disgusting worms hanging in your small intestine.\n* Helicobacter pylori, a nasty gastrointestinal bacterium, may also cause some urticarias.\n\n**All my sources, all my studies, all my knowledge and further interesting things are summarized in my personal Knowledge Map.**\n\nFor more possible causes and how to recognize them, check out my Knowledge Map:In research (to the right) ‚Üí Health ‚Üí Human problems ‚Üí Cholinergic urticaria\n\n[https://www.mindmeister.com/1649064493?t=VWsYHQvRwS](https://www.mindmeister.com/1649064493?t=VWsYHQvRwS)\n\n# The search for the cure\n\nNow that we actually have a track of what may cause CU, there are quite a few options to try. These are just some I thought of - please let me know if you know of others that either decrease poral occlusion or increase muscarinic receptors!\n\nRemember, these are mostly theoretical!\n\n**Keratolytic creams.**\n\nIf there actually are poral plugs involved, keratolytics may be able to take care of them. Examples are:\n\n* Urea cream - really keratolytic at 20% or more\n* Salicylic acid creams - commonly used in beauty face masks\n* Glycolic acid, lactic acid, retinoic acid creams\n* General skin lotions: The plugs may also form due to simple and plain skin dryness. This may explain why in some CU cases, winter (drier skin) hits harder than summer ever could.\n\nFor some of these, I have already heard reports of them helping in CU.\n\n**Increase your muscarinic receptors.**\n\nThis one is harder - there are no clear treatments we can put onto skin and *swoosh* there are more receptors. But there are some possible candidates:\n\n* Exercise. Athletes sweat more easily - possibly due to higher muscarinic acetylcholine receptors? We don't know. But it is worth a try. And it would explain why \"sweat therapy\" works for so many in this sub.\n* Choline rich diets. Choline rich diets may - counter-intuitively - increase the number of acetylcholine receptors. Choline rich foods are eggs, beef, chicken, kidney beans, etc. (See my Map for more)\n* Choline supplementation. Choline is also easily available as a supplement. They do that over at r/Nootropics a lot.\n\nOnce again: These are just the ones I found worthy to put into this post. On the Map, I noted \\~30 other inventions which may alleviate CU: [https://www.mindmeister.com/1649064493?t=VWsYHQvRwS](https://www.mindmeister.com/1649064493?t=VWsYHQvRwS)\n\nThe main problem is, these are theoretical. No researcher was interested enough or found enough funding to test these in a randomized controlled clinical trial.\n\n**But as all these interventions are pretty safe if done properly and pose low risks, we are free to try them. And - imagine if one of these actually cures your CU.**\n\nI am on my way to try all of them. But I need your help too.\n\nGo test yourself for hypothyroidism, for thyroid antibodies, for parasites, for helicobacter pylori, etc. Go and experiment - science it at your disposal.\n\nAnd for the sake of the community, please report back.\n\nAnd at last, most easily: If you have read anything that may my reading, if you know some studies to send me: Please do so. I am fallible, and appreciate any proper evidence-based feedback.",

        "body": "All I want to say is I really appreciate you for all the work you put your time in doing. I too experience CU and its THE WORST! The pain and prickly feeling is not a simple ‚Äúitch‚Äù that doctors say it is. It feels like a million ants biting you all over the place. The worst part is that when you get it, it itches then you get more stressed so it itches more. This shit is crazy! \n\n\nI just wanted to say that my CU peaked right after quarantine started. When everything shut down and nothing was open. I believe it is because I stopped playing soccer and exercising as much as i used too, meaning I sweat less. This made my CU a lot worse and caused a shit ton of acne on my face. Now that things are back open (at least for the most part) my CU got a little better but it still hurts the same. Knowing that this can last for over 20 years is the scariest part. I had it for about 4-5 years without realizing what it was until around 2 years ago. I also want to add that during the winter of last year in January I went up to Big Bear Mountain to go snowboarding. I was worried I would itch the whole time up there because it was pretty warm and I would sweat, however I felt nothing. Everything seemed perfectly normal and I felt no symptoms whatsoever. This is really weird to me because when I came back home 3 days later my Cholinergic Urticaria came back as well...  No one thinks that CU is bad but it definitely needs more attention to it. Thank you again!",

I haven't been properly diagnosed. I get the feeling low humidity has something to do with it. I wonder, do people with CU always get hives? I get extremely itchy when my body temp goes up when exercising or even when I get nervous in a social interaction but I don't get any visible hives. When exercising, I get itchy all over my body, hands and feet for about 20 minutes then the itching completely goes away. It's really frustrating because like most, getting endorphins from exercise is my way of coping with the stresses of life. I'm going to try some of the stuff you mentioned in the post above and report back. Thanks so much!",

I wanted to report some of the stuff you mentioned as someone who‚Äôs suffered from this. \nI had hyperthyroidism when CU started in June/July of this year. But, my dosage was all over the place for last year. My thyroid isn‚Äôt active anymore - radioactive iodine several years ago as a treatment for Graves Disease. So you might have a good idea with thyroid disorders and this. \n\nAnother thing, and I don‚Äôt know how exactly to explain it but the drug topamax has been seen to cause CU or just general urticaria. I was on this for close to a year but my doctor increased my dosage about two/three months before my first breakout of CU.  From the little research I did on it, topamax can effect sweat glands - which could line up with Hypothesis one you listed. \n\nNow that my thyroid levels (including antibodies) are back in the normal range, my CU has also gone down. Now, I have been doing sweat therapy every other day for the last two weeks so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a factor because I noticed the CU going down before I started sweat therapy. \nJust my two cents. I‚Äôm not a scientist so idk how valid my comment is, i just wanted to share my experience. \nBut this was great! I really appreciate you writing this up and sharing it with us.\n\n\nEdit: also want to add that shortly before starting sweat therapy, I also quit taking topamax. So, I‚Äôm not sure if that was the culprit or it was my thyroid.",

The urticaria is \"autoimmune\". The immune system is attacking the normal tissues of the body and causing hives as a result. We know certain urticaria sufferers have other signs of autoimmune problems. Some have autoimmune thyroid disease, **vitiligo**, swollen joints, or certain abnormalities in the blood (especially the ANA test). A new treatment has recently emerged for autoimmune urticaria. This is the use of **hydroxychloroquine**, a drug originally used for malaria. In a clinical trial 83% improved or cleared completely when used for three months or more. \"  \n\n\nMy doctor mentioned I also have sweat rashes and explained that there could be something in my sweat causing the reactions on my skin.

Thought it was related to a new medicine I was on. \n\nSo, after avoiding exercise for months & basically crying through my 40th bday trip in Hawaii (because every hike or cool thing we did I was covered in hives & crawling out of my skin!!!), I cut the dose of the medicine in 1/2.

I can only estimate because my memory from that time is rather clouded by medication bouts, but my mother has told me at least ten times by the time I was 8 years old. As a child, it's absolutely debilitating. My small size was absolutely a factor in how quickly my wheals would spread. The severity ranging from minor issues just living my life, to full body breakouts with wheal congregations dinner plate size and bigger. My entire back, legs, arms, everything. Swelling usually begins around my head and I can immediately tell when I am sick with anything, cold, flu, whatever, when my ears start to swell up.\n\nHowever, this did not entirely stop me from being physically active as a child or teenager, I was in soccer, marching band, and finally JROTC during my entire educational term. As I have grown, it does take longer for the condition to \"spread\" but once it begins, it lasts with great intensity for days, sometimes weeks.\n\nI have tried everything. Sweat therapy. Dietary changes. Lifestyle adjustments with my lotions, shampoos, soaps, everything. I keep my home exceptionally clean to avoid mold and bacterial build up. I don't even leave soap in a soap dish, I will set it on a hook in the sun. As for what medications? I can  list many. Zyrtec(when it was in liquid form until its pill form we know today), Claritin, Allegra, various histamine blockers, HTC, and Xolair, and the only thing that seems to help me process the issue are directly affecting antihistamines like Benadryl or Hydroxyzine and copious amounts of water to pass the histamines through my urine.\n\nAt around 22, I had another hospitalization that resulted in my beginning to work from home and various healthy habit changes, I was in a very well controlled state for almost 10 years, about a year and a half ago, after I received the Moderna vaccination, came out of remission with a vengeance. My usual methods of management are barely keeping it in check and I hope to go back into remission soon and I'm currently looking into immuno suppressant therapy based on a study by the APAACI group, an international organization for immunology and allergy studies, they have a lot of informative information available. As well as a recommendation from my current immunologist that, thank God, was versed in my condition before I visited.\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure how much my case information helps you but I do know this is all tied to my immune system in some way. Belsomra, a rather new sleep aid, directly affects the immune system and it has been the only sleep aid that has ever worked for me. I have tried everything and ambien between.\n\nGood luck with your study! I would like to see a day where there is a consistent treatment for everyone. No one should have to go through this.",

I also wanted to share a bit about my experience with my hives that I suspect is cholinergic urticaria, but as I am undiagnosed, I thought I'd mention this as a disclaimer of sorts just for good measure. My symptoms first started around two to three years ago when I was around 21 or 22 years old, and it flares up whenever my body temperature increases, so I've broken out while walking, exercising, when nervous, anxious, or scared, or even just from getting too excited while watching an action film. Usually, the burning, stinging pain occurs before the intense itching, followed by sweat, and there's always a patch of red, irritated skin at the location of the flare up. Sometimes, there is a noticeable, round wheal at the center of the patch and sometimes there is not. These red patches and wheals, once the itching subsides, fade away within the hour, although I'm noticing that following these events, small reddish bumps or scar-like dots are left behind, although this could just be because my skin scars very easily. My skin can scar from a very mild papercut. There also seems to be a period of time between starting to get warm and my symptoms but before I start sweating, although this period of time varies. I've also been able to sweat before the onset of symptoms, but this is rare and generally only happens when I first wake up in the morning. I have noticed that my hives take longer to appear in cold weather because it takes longer for my body temperature to seemingly reach that \"threshold\" at which symptoms begin. I've tried taking daily over-the-counter antihistamines for a couple months, but they didn't do anything as far as I could tell. I am currently trying salicylic acid body wash at 1% along with an exfoliating shower tool to see if my symptoms are caused by blocked pores and if they can be cleared. I am unable to make a conclusive report on how this affects my symptoms as I have only started testing this last week.\n\n  \nIt is worth noting, although it may seem completely unrelated, that I am FTM (female-to-male) transgender, and I have undergone a double mastectomy and am currently taking injectable testosterone as part of my hormone replacement therapy. Shortly after my double mastectomy, I began developing a chronic condition that resembled erythema nodosum on my ankles, shins, and thighs that lasted about three or four years. It was undiagnosed and untreated, although during the coarse of figuring out what they were last year, my PCP ran a blood test for antibodies, and my levels of ANA were abnormal. I have not since been able to see a rheumatologist for a followup on this test result. Additionally, my symptoms of CU began after about 8 months of my taking testosterone, and since I've been told that androgens can affect the skin, it might make some sense for CU to be in some way influenced by sex hormones. Many people who take testosterone have also developed CU, although not enough people to warrant its inclusion on the list of effects of testosterone given to patients on their informed consent for hormone replacement therapy. I have only anecdotal evidence thus far to go on in terms of the correlation between taking testosterone and the development of CU, but the occurrence of CU among FTM individuals is at least at a notable amount according to the internet. Also, although I am not diagnosed with any autoimmune or thyroid issues, I have a family history of thyroid issues, and my blood test indicates an autoimmune condition. Hoping you might find this information interesting.\n\n6-MONTH UPDATE: It seems like a reliable way to ease my symptoms is making myself sweat past the itching phase, although this must be consistently done every other day at the least or else symptoms start returning. The salicylic acid bodywash at 1% has helped with body acne noticeably as well as dampening the severity of my symptoms, although not enough to justify continuing to use it for that sole purpose. This very slight dampening of my symptoms did not start becoming apparent until around 3 months after I began bathing with this bodywash, used once a day, which makes sense when taking into account the time frame most dermatologists recommend using a new topical treatment to see if it works (also 3 months). These days, I tend to experience my symptoms less often, although that might be due to the weather getting gradually cooler or perhaps getting used to the 78-80¬∞F temperature my family keeps the house. I have since switched bodywashes about 1 month ago to see if my symptoms get worse in an attempt to rule out acclimation.\n\nAdditionally, I have seen a rheumatologist, and all my blood work has come back in the normal range for all of the tests she ran, apart from the ANA. She also ordered chest x-rays to rule out tuberculosis on account of my shortness of breath that I sometimes experience. The x-rays have come back normal as well, and I have a follow-up appointment with her around the end of this month, October 2024, to discuss next steps. It seems likely that I do not have an autoimmune disorder.",

I recently switched to bioderma atoderm shower oil and I immediately noticed a difference, my skin is glowing. For hydration I use pyukangyul ceramide body lotion or cerave body lotion everyday after showering. The ceramides are unsung heroes for keratosis pilaris skin, every cream with ceramides rrally works great but pyukangyul is my favourite. During hot months I switch to pure aloe vera gel without perfume, usually korean brand. And I do body peeling once per week, no sugar though. Try 'sand' based peeling  they are often made for face rather than body but something about it plays nicely with my kp, better than sugar or salt scrub. \n\nYou need to stay consistent though, this is a lifestyle lol.",

Look up the probiotic: ‚ÄúBacillus licheniformis‚Äù. Order a sample, find the best deal. But instead of swallowing the capsules, ‚Äúculture‚Äù them in either raw whole milk, or water with prebiotic powder (like inulin powder, with no ‚Äús‚Äù). Even jars of applesauce are easy ways to turn a probiotic capsule of billions into trillions or quadrillions of units. Just stir it up. If you have a food dehydrator that can reach near 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (like an Excalibur 3926T), you can use it as an incubator to ferment things. Culture for like 4 days at least at 98.6 degrees F. Use internally and externally. Get it into all bodily openings and use your water kefir you made and spray your skin in every spot regularly. This bacteria produces an enzyme called ‚Äúkeratinase‚Äù that digests keratin. You can keep growing and multiply them indefinitely from 1-2 capsules. Spray them in your garden soil too. Any probiotic starting with ‚ÄúBacillus‚Äù survives easily in soil, helps feed and protect plants, and produces spores that protect themselves from stomach acid and heat, meaning they can easily survive the stomach and even cooking to a certain degree. They can indefinitely help a garden and once they‚Äôre colonized in the soil it will impossible to get rid of them, which is a good thing with good bacteria.\n\nAvoid getting any salicylic acid in your hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, or it may strip the keratin and require a keratin treatment to fix.\n\nIf acidic products don‚Äôt correct dryness then make sure you‚Äôre not canceling out the effects with any alkaline products. Get rid of them and don‚Äôt look back. Stick with acidic products only. If that doesn‚Äôt fix dryness, then it‚Äôs most likely a calcium, magnesium, potassium, and/or sodium electrolyte ion deficiency.\n\nEstrogen deficiency can also cause chronic dry skin.\n\nUpdate: vitamin C deficiency can also be the culprit.",

The pics above are taken once a week, same day, same time, same lighting (as much as possible) over 4 weeks.\n\nI've been applying twice a day, AM and PM. I *think* there's been improvement but it's also fall/winter where I am and so I'm indoors more therefore getting less sun.\n\n*Weekdays*\nMorning: \nCold water rinse\nEucerin Dual Serum (let dry min. 5 mins)\nSunscreen (varies - Elta Md, Biore Aqua Rich)(let dry min. 5 mins)\nEstee Lauder Futurist Hydra Rescue Foundation\n\nEvening:\nBanilla Clean Zero Makeup Remover Balm\nLa Roche-Posay Toleriane Cleanser\nPaula's Choice Mandelic/Lactic Acid \nEucerin Dual Serum (let dry min. 5 mins)\nJojoba oil (if I'm feeling extra dry)\nKiehls Ulta Facial Cream \n\nOn the weekends, I simplify and focus on moisture because my face is always dry. So I skip the Eucerin and do the oil/moisturizer combo morning and night. \n\nThe smell is intense but I did get use to it quick and it doesn't irrate my skin, so I don't mind. The biggest downside for me is that it pills under just about everything if I'm inpatient and don't let it dry or if I rub too hard with my hands or brushes, especially on my temples for some reason. \n\n ",

    "body": "This is an interesting thread but one that seems to have few actual voices from practicing primary care doctors.  I wanted to add something about my experience to the discussion. \n\nI am a 43 yo general internist and have been in practice for 15 years in a large multispecialty group practice. I work and live in a metropolitan area with a population of half a million, with another million in the surrounding metro area.  \n\nFor the first 10 years of my career I worked on call to the ER a few nights a month and rounded in the hospital a week every 6-8 weeks in addition to running a clinic practice.  I gave this call schedule up voluntarily 5 years ago when I got married and we started to plan kids, as I found sleeping in my bed every night to be increasingly compelling.  Now my work is all clinic based.\n\nMy salary, plus bonuses, at this point is 240k, and I do not pay my own malpractice out of this (just taxes, which is enough).  I take every Wed afternoon off (and take a 10% pay cut to do so, this is reflected in my salary above already), but to be honest I spend half of that time catching up on work.  My typical work day is between 10-11 hours, and I do not take lunch.  I also work a few hours every weekend from home to keep caught up. \n\nBecause I work in a large group practice, I do NO insurance paperwork.  Yes, you did read that correctly.  That does not mean I do not have all kinds of BS to put up with, just not that particularly irritating kind.  The BS I do put up with includes all sort of Dilbert-esque level large corporate nonsense, but none that has interfered with what I do inside the exam room. \n\nMy visits with patients are typically 20 minutes.  I carry a panel of about 1900 patients, who vary from homeless people with drug habits to a serving congressman.  Over 85% of the patients I see daily are on my own panel, and many of them I have known for over 10 years.  \nAs this is a diverse area, I see people with a very wide variety of ethnic backgrounds (including recent Hmong, Russian, Nigerian, and Brittish expats) and use language line phone translation not infrequently during exams. \n\nIn addition to visits, I spend about 2-3 hours a day managing lab results, replying to patient emails, establishing followup plans from hospitalizations, etc.  I also serve on our quality assurance committee (I highly suggest getting involved in this if you can; it is an education in and of itself). \n\nSince I work in a large group practice where there are no barriers to communication with specialists, I find that the medicine part of my job can be as complex as I want it to be.  I send patients out to see specialists when either I need their expertise or to do a procedure I do not perform.   Often times I collaborate with them via the phone or email,  often times in real time while the patient is in the exam room (video derm consults included here).   \n\nI manage my own heart failure, CAD, asthma, COPD, etc.  I treat a lot of common ailments, but also spend a lot of time working up new complaints. Because my nurses are great, we can handle some things that might go to the ED otherwise (put fluid into the potentially septic patient while waiting on their lactic acid level, for example, or get same day cat scans done with stat labs on a RLQ abdominal pain). \n\nWhen word got out my wife was expecting, I received from my patients something like a dozen home made receiving blankets, including ones that (from watching my wife do similar projects) I know must have taken twenty or thirty hours of work to create.  Jokes, inquiries about my family's well being, and other small gifts are common occurrences (and things I greatly appreciate).  The vast majority of my patient interactions are pleasant or downright fun. \n\nBecause I get up early every morning (well, I'm at work at 7:30, so that will not sound early to you poor slobs still in training, sorry!), I am home in time every night to eat dinner with my family, do bath time and story time with my daughter, and spend time with my wife before going to sleep.  If you do not have a family now, believe me, this will be VERY important to you later. \n\nMy undergraduate degree was from an ivy-league school in molecular biology, and I finished in the top 1/3 of my graduating class in medical school.  I initially thought about going into gastroenterology (endoscopy is cool) but lost interest along the way, and did not like the idea of being a trainee for another two or three years after residency.  I have found in no way that my interactions with specialists have left me feeling like a second class citizen; many of them are not just my colleagues, but my patients as well!\n\nPersonally, I like my doctoring to be a 50/50 mix of biomedicine and personal interaction, which is why I think primary care works well for me as a career.  Of course I do see tons of colds, and also have repeated the information about colorectal cancer screening so many times it is a loop tape in my head now that I probably mutter in my sleep.  But last week in clinic I also had a new spontaneous pneumothorax (my diagnosis, pulmonary clinic put in the catheter), a new dx of nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain in a 42 yo (missed by the ER two days previously, due to her near complete lack of focal neurological findings despite her significant midline shift, a real tragedy for her family), and a follow up appointment with my gent with a thoracic stromal cell tumor (good news, surgeon felt likely to be nonaggressive, we await final immunohistology to find out).  And also saw the patient who has lost 80 lbs in two years without gastric bypass because she listened to me that she needed to get more exercise and stop eating so damn much.  :)\n\nI have no idea how typical or not my personal experience is among primary care doctors nationwide.  Personally I am quite happy to be practicing as a general internist and have no regrets about my decision to not pursue a subspecialty.  \n\nTo the medical students and residents reading this forum - I wish you all the best of luck making this choice.  Finding out you picked the wrong specialty after the fact is a hard pill to swallow, but there are certainly worse mistakes you can make in life.  Go investigate your options on your own as vigorously as you can (including getting outside of the academic world) and do not take anyone's word over your own judgement on something this important.

        "body": "Thanks for posting your experience, I had posted my own experience in that thread but it probably got buried deep inside it, so I'll repost it here since this thread title is more apropos to what I had posted initially: \n\nComing up on 13 years as a family practice physician in a suburban area. Still paying off my loans but no regrets. I have a comfortable but not lavish life- I see my first patient at 800am and my last one at 415pm. I live 10 minutes from work and most days I'm home by 530pm. No evening hours, no weekend hours. I have the flexibility of taking time off to attend all of my children's school activities and being an active part of their lives. I have the time to pursue non-medical hobbies.\n\nI have whole families who see me, I've seen kids grow up and become parents. I've seen marriages and divorces, births and deaths. There are names I see on my appointment schedule that I know I'll enjoy the visit and that offsets the office visits that wear me down. There are patients that I've said the same things over and over to, and there are those I know I've made a difference with.\n\nThere are patients who piss me off and there are patients that I have learned from. What I do as a primary care doc is provide longitudinal care- over 13 years many of these people value my opinion on a variety of things. Some people tell me things they won't even tell their spouse. Most times I can't fix what comes to me but sometimes all people want is someone who listens and is smart enough to offer options and suggestions.\n\nI know there are households where my phone number is as important as the phone number of a spouse, parent, or close friend. That is a privilege and honor I do my best to not forget. Just last week a patient gave me a hug when she left- I've known her and her family for 10+ years and she said \"You're like family to us for all that you've done\". But I've done nothing earth shaking or saved their lives. All I've really done was be available, listened, and gave a shit.\n\nBeing a primary care physician isn't for everyone. I liken my job to playing golf. I'll play 17 holes of bad golf but that one good shot one that one hole makes the frustrations worth it and that's what keeps me going.\n\nYou ask yourself what you want out of life and chose the path that meets your intellectual, emotional, and yes, financial needs. If that's a specialty, then go do it and love it. If that's primary care, then do it and love it. Not all of us can be primaries, not all of us can be specialists. But we all can be good at medicine and enjoy life.\n\nTo this I'd add the following: \n\nFrom my own experience, insurance headaches have been present but manageable, the volume is up to me- I could be considerably more \"comfortable\" if I packed my schedule, but that's not my style and I'm fortunate enough to be in a practice where I have a high level of autonomy in the areas that matter to me. Some have aired concerns about the encroachment of mid levels in primary care, but I see plenty of consult letters from specialists that come from their mid levels. And my experience after nearly 13 years (and yes, we have mid levels in our practice) is that most people want to see a physician and if not, they'll only see the PA/NP for the simple acute care stuff. \n\nPatients by and large want a longitudinal relationship with their physician just as much we who are primary care physicians would want with them. And I think that's what I probably enjoy the most, after a while you get to know your panel of patients quite well. And they get to know me quite well as well. Some office visits might even consist of a lot of socializing, even. In time I've learned to see the world through their eyes. \n\nThose who have posted about some of the BS they wouldn't want to deal with as a primary care provider, well, yeah, that BS *is* out there and yes, there are some days where I'm completely and utterly frustrated with my career choice. But at the end of the day it's really all a wash and most days I come home feeling like I've done something worthwhile.",

    "body": "I‚Äôve been around the sun a little over 36 times, and have figured a few things out I hear a lot of you struggling with. Here is all my advice for living your best life, inside and out. I‚Äôm a brown girlie growing up in the US so some of my experiences and advice might be specific to that but I hope most of it applies to anyone. My creds: I am old now with children, but I've got skin like my 3 year old (well... almost)  a snatched waistline, and most importantly - decent mental health and self esteem (on most days).\n\n**Health**\n\nEVERYTHING starts here! Prioritize your physical and mental health. Every minute you invest into your well being here you will get back 10x with better energy, focus, positivity, and happiness.¬†\n\n* **Exercise every day**. You‚Äôve heard this a million times, so if you‚Äôre not doing this ask yourself why. Do you think you don‚Äôt deserve to prioritize your health? Did your auntie tell you you should spend 3 more hours crying into your math textbook instead of ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù on a work out? Or do you not know where to get started? You don‚Äôt need any special equipment - look up some videos on 10-15 minute workouts you can do at home. Make it a daily habit for a few weeks, and you‚Äôll naturally start feeling the motivation and enthusiasm to do more. There is nothing on this list I can say with more certainty will make you feel, look, and BE better than this.\n* **Eat a balanced diet with lots of protein and veggies, carbs in moderation, and minimize sugar and alcohol**. I had some food intolerances when I was younger that made me a really picky eater. You can just imagine how much my family, extended relatives, and family friends had to say about how awful this was. Well guess who‚Äôs not fat, and whose kids are all on track for high blood sugar and hypertension? That sounds petty, but the point is don‚Äôt listen other people‚Äôs nonsense about what you should be eating, or let yourself get peer pressured into eating garbage.¬†\n* **Sleep.** Don‚Äôt work/stress/reddit/whatever you‚Äôre doing late - it‚Äôs not worth it. Set a time when you‚Äôre done for the day, start unwinding, erect a mental brick wall between you and your imagined problems, and sleep.\n* **Drink water -** more! Even more! You‚Äôre probably dehydrated right now.\n\n**Un-brainwash yourself from your family.**¬†\n\n* This is such a constant theme in this sub. And I really, honestly get it. I felt like such a disappointment as a kid that one day something snapped, and I stopped caring about what my family said and thought altogether. I knew it would never be enough. I didn‚Äôt yell and scream about it - I still love my family. I just recognized that they are victims of their own family and cultural brainwashing and their anxiety is their problem. As an adult, I now make lots of $$$ in my very successful tech job, and they still find things to complain or be passive aggressive about. Tough chaklis for them!\n* The expectations put on young brown women is ridiculous. Your families want an obedient little conformist who has the perfect parent-approved-career, that they can brag about to all their friends, who takes care of them into their old age. You need to recognize how much power you actually have in your situation. Get educated, get financially independent, and make decisions for yourself. Recognize that THEY will soon depend on YOU. YOU are the one who has to live with your life choices about your career and partner, not them. They will deal with it. Your mileage may vary depending on how cray your family is, but if you know what will make you happy you need to go for it -  the people that love you and actually want the best for you will come to terms. Stop needing validation and approval from them at every step. They probably didn‚Äôt wake up and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to emotionally handicap my daughter so she serves my needs the rest of my life‚Äù, but they didn‚Äôt need to because society did it for them. Forgive them, know better, and move on.\n\n**Personality**\n\n* Your entire experience of life happens inside your brain. Your self image and mental filter need to be as objective as possible. If you‚Äôre on this sub, it‚Äôs highly likely you are expecting fixing your looks will fix a lot of your other problems. While you‚Äôre working on that, take a fresh look at your emotional coping skills and social skills.¬† ¬†\n* Work on your hobbies, read some books, go to a concert, listen to some comedy, BE INTERESTING. LIVE A FULL LIFE. I have met a lot of people who were initially beautiful and attractive on the outside, and quickly found myself incredibly bored and turned off by how vapid, dumb, or uninteresting they were on the inside.¬†\n\n**Now on to the LEWKS section!**\n\n**Skin**\n\n* Tretinoin. Work your way up in strength, and always prioritize your moisture barrier and minimize skin irritation. I went crazy in my mid 20‚Äôs with this stuff thinking my skin was purging or overcoming sensitivity. WRONG! Just use a little at a time.\n* Alternate with lactic acid or no treatment till you‚Äôre sure your skin isn‚Äôt irritated\n* I used azaelic acid and Hydroquinone to get rid of hyperpigmentation around the mouth. A lot of brown ladies have gorgeous lips, and the darkness around the mouth can really detract from that. This is not for skin lightening - this is for hyperpigmentation - lighter is NOT better if I have to scream it from the roofs\n* Wear sunscreen every day\n\n**Makeup**\n\n* Again, lighter skin IS NOT better!!!! Don‚Äôt wear foundation that is lighter than your skin, it is not a good look and makes you look sick. I mix a bronzing concentrate with a tinted moisturized to get my perfect shade in all seasons. Match to your neck and chest. Know your undertone, as a bronzer may not work for you. Our skin tone is such a halo if we play it up right.\n* Color corrector instead of concealer - helps avoid weird ashiness from a too-light concealer.\n* Eyes - I use a pencil to line my top waterline only, and go over it with a dark gel liner + fine eyeliner brush to get a gentle, tapered line. Lining your bottom eyes can make you look tired or give you an odd eye shape IMO. I use a neutral eyeshadow that‚Äôs close-ish to my skin as a base, and then a very very light handed bit of a darker color to give my hooded eyes some depth or tweak my eye shape as needed\n* Brows - I use grand lash serum here (not on my eyes) + a light handed eyebrow pomade. No block brows.\n* Lips - stain > lipstick, and moisturize your lips - make sure you don‚Äôt have peeling lips or lipstick. I cringe when I see lipstick that looks unsettled\n\n**Hair**\n\n* Toning is key if you have highlights. Don‚Äôt have gross un-toned highlights or balayage.¬†\n* Use deep conditioning masks and toning masks\n* I use an airwrap and lightweight silicone based hair oil / serum, and always have a perfect hair day\n\n**Hardmaxxes**\n\n* Teeth - get braces and correct any asymmetry here first before doing anything else\n* Filler - I would be very very wary of filler - I'm sure you've seen a hundred posts about how it doesn't go well for a lot of people. I have always wanted filler but now in my 30s I see that the girls getting filler in their 20s are starting to look a little... off.... I'm all for surgery if you want it, but save your money on something that won't make you look melty in 5 years.\n* nose job - I'm still thinking about getting one, maybe I will one day. I struggle with whether this is my being brainwashed by western beauty standards, and I'm still figuring it out. In the meantime, I'll enjoy the rest of my face without going too nuts.\n\nEdit: How could I forget **hair removal**!!! the bane of our existences.\n\n* once every two months or so I shave my face as a way to exfoliate. Be careful about doing this depending on the rest of your skin routine as it may be too harsh if its already sensitized.\n* I use an epillator on my arms and legs which pulls hair out by the root - this was such a game changing alternative to waxing and shaving\n* I use waxing strips on my upper lip . As someone pointed out you can peel your skin off (happened to me!) if you‚Äôre getting started on tret. Don‚Äôt wax if your skin is sensitive.",

One thing that makes things 10 times harder for me are the people in my life (my in-laws and extended family). My husband hamdles them for the most part, but the things they say/do triggers me so much. There is so much hate in me for them. We live miles away from them, even then this is an issue. \nThey say/do something then I immediately worry about it or go into a spiral about what they'll do in the coming days. No sleep, excessive overthinking, eating random stuff, completely throws of schedule. \n\nHow do I detach myself from their drama? How do I be unbothered by it?",

    "body": "Hi I'm a physiotherapist who also rollerskates. I've seen a lot of questions regarding strength based exercises and/or warm ups for skating so I thought I'd make a monster post to help you all out.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the muscle groups used in skating. In skating there are a lot of muscle groups working together to keep you upright. First there are your hip extensors (glutes/booty) and knee extensors (quads) which help you be able to maintain a slightly crouched position which will help your stability. Then there are your ABductors (the muscles on the outside of your hip (gluteus medius) which help with pushing through your skate and holding your pelvis steady when you are on one leg. Then you have your ADductors which hold your legs in and are important for not sliding into side splits. Then there is your core which again is important to help with maintaining balance - we don't want to be inflatable waving tube men on skates (I hope you know what I mean when I say this) or putting too much load through your back\n\nWarm up:\n\nWhat is a warm up?\n\nSimply put it is a way of using the muscles that will be used in the sport/activity that you are warming up for. Warming up increases blood flow to the joints and primes the muscles for use at a higher intensity.\n\nWhat should I do for skating?\n\nMy go to exercises for warm ups for skating are:\n\n* Squats - will warm up quadriceps and glutes  x 20\n* [Plank step forwards](https://media2.popsugar-assets.com/files/2013/05/13/793/n/1922729/bc9e4c469e50a609_Runners-Lunge-Stretch.preview.jpg) \\- 10 per leg these will help open up your hip flexors\n* Hip openings/closings - lift your knee up as high as you can with your knee facing forward the rotate your hip so your knee is now pointing to the side. Place your leg down. Do the reverse 10 each side (total of 20). [See this picture](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/40/80/8e/40808e39ac3897b183837c6be21cb358.jpg) for an idea of the positioning\n* [Dynamic hamstring stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDP5sEigV2M) \\- 10 per side (20 total)\n\nExercises that will help with strengthening the muscles used in rollerskating (you don't need to do all of these in one session (in fact you shouldn't). Instead pick 2-3 from each muscle group:\n\nQuads, Glutes and hamstrings:\n\n* Squats - 3 x 10 - if you can use weights to make this harder as most people can squat easily. If you don't have a gym membership or access to weights you can find things around your house e.g. a box of books, shopping bag of heavy groceries etc.\n* [squat pulses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4fzbBv4BFI) \\- 5 x 30s this will work on muscular endurance and being able to maintain a stable position - you can attempt these on skates when you are able to stand confidently\n* [Static squats](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/00/58/8e/00588e9c957437f69af869ac95bd3a49.jpg) \\- simply hold the position shown in the link for a period time - aim to be able to do 5 reps of 30s each - you can attempt these on skates when you are able to stand confidently\n* [Squat jumps](https://3i133rqau023qjc1k3txdvr1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Squat-Jump_Exercise.jpg) \\- same as a squat but instead of standing up you jump up\n* [Tuck jumps](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/workouts/2016/05/full-body-burn-20-minutes-no-equipment-composites-tuck-jumps-1462316037.jpg?resize=980:*) \\- 3 x 10 - these will help with any jumps you are trying to get on roller skates and also work your hip flexors! For variation you can do tuck jumps side to side over an object or front and back over an object.\n* [Wall sit](https://www.anytimefitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fullsizeoutput_39.jpeg) \\- 5 x 30s - again this works on muscular endurance required for skating again\n* [Single leg bridges](https://3i133rqau023qjc1k3txdvr1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Single-Leg-Hamstring-Bridge_Exercise.jpg) \\- Aim for 3 x 15 per leg\n* [Single leg squats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keSzg7MaoVQ) \\- Aim for 3 x 15 per leg - don't fret if you can't go all the way down just go down as far as you can manage and as you get stronger you will be able to go down\n* [Single leg deadlifts](https://www.fitwirr.com/wp-content/plugins/phastpress/phast.php/c2VydmljZT1pbWFnZXMmc3JjPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmZpdHdpcnIuY29tJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnVwbG9hZHMlMkYyMDIwJTJGMDIlMkZkdW1iYmVsbC1yZGwtb25lLWxlZy1vbmUtYXJtLTEucG5nJmNhY2hlTWFya2VyPTE2MDgyNDM0NzktNDEyNTQmdG9rZW49MDNhNzRiZmNiODMwOGExOA.q.png) \\- 3 x 15 each leg - this will also help with that pain in your lower back you get when you start skating\n\nAbductors\n\n* [Modified side plank hold](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U7cLUU7110k/maxresdefault.jpg) \\- this works your bottom glute, aim for 5 reps of 30s. To make this harder you can straighten your top leg and then have both legs out so you are balancing on your forearm and feet. For super hard mode lift the top leg up so you only have one foot on the ground.\n* Modified side plank lifts - same position as above but go down to the ground and back up repeatedly - 3 x 15 each side.\n* [Crab walks with band](https://lifetrimmers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/resistance-band-crab-walk.jpg)\\- 3 x 20 each direction\n\nAdductors\n\n* Get a basket ball, soccer ball, yoga block or something similar and place it between your ankles - squeeze as hard as you can for 10s - 3 x 15. Repeat progress with your knees bent lying on your back with the ball between your knees. when those are easy put the ball between your legs in [table top/dead bug position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrtIPe8ds5Q) and hold while you do movements with your arms as per the video - this should also engage your core.\n* [Adductor slide outs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPBLtoDLqM) \\- 3 x 15, as it becomes easier go further out with your sliding leg\n* [Adductor leg raises](https://1ophtu1oqvwz2oq7y2390afz-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AS_adductor-leg-raises-L1.jpg) \\- 3 x 15\n* [Adductor leg lifts with bench](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b1/82/19/b18219ade073e49a063c089efb0b18cb.jpg) \\- 3 x 10 - this is quite challenging so make sure you have some strength in your adductors and core first.\n\nCore/back\n\n* All of the above will also engage your core but [dead bug](https://media.self.com/photos/580a37dc7f7be8915ea98685/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/dead-bug_ab-stacked.jpg) is a really good way of specifically targeting the core. Start with legs and arms separately then work on adding them together.\n* [Plank](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/planks-workout-shoot-1285-1585680192.jpg?resize=980:*) \\- 5 x 30s\n* [Commando planks](https://3i133rqau023qjc1k3txdvr1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Army-Crawl-Plank_Exercise.jpg) \\- 3 x 20 (alternate which hand goes first)\n* [Back extensions](https://3i133rqau023qjc1k3txdvr1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Mid-Back-Extensions_Exercise.jpg) \\- 3 x 20\n\nCool down\n\nCool downs are super important to avoid feeling sore the next day! In a cool down you decrease the intensity of your work out but continue to move for a bit to allow metabolites such as lactic acid to clear the muscle. I generally would recommend a leisurely skate around a basketball court or something similar followed by some stretches\n\n* Hip flexors - same as above but hold for 30s on each side\n* [Pidgeon pose](https://www.verywellfit.com/thmb/fF0yPlZ_WuIWo9v4Taf5Kr4RIi0=/768x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Verywell-07-3567179-Pigeon02-133-598b72f5b501e80012e733ab.gif) \\- 30s sitting up, 30s leaning forward on each side\n* [Childs pose](https://yogapractice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/All-about-Childs-Pose.jpg) \\- 30s\n* [Modified Cobra](https://www.satyaliveyoga.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Easy-cobra-pose-Saral-Bhujangasana1.jpg) \\- 30s (you can also do full cobra but personally I prefer modified cobra as it stretches my upper back more)\n* [Adductor/groin stretch](https://www.bloomsbury-osteopathy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LEGM20-Adductor-Stretch.jpg) \\- 30s each leg",

This program can be circumvented by a protein-based genetic element, the [*GAR*+] prion, permitting simultaneous metabolism of glucose and other carbon sources. Diverse bacteria can elicit yeast cells to acquire [*GAR*+], although the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. Here we identify the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid as a strong [*GAR*+] inducer. Transient exposure to lactic acid caused yeast cells to heritably circumvent glucose repression. This trait had the defining genetic properties of [*GAR*+], and did not require utilization of lactic acid as a carbon source. Lactic acid also induced [*GAR*+]-like epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from *S. cerevisiae* ~200 million years ago, and in which glucose repression evolved independently. To our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover a bacterial metabolite with the capacity to potently induce a prion.",

Since that first taste, I spent hours researching reddit and the internet for a perfect recipe.  Unfortunately there are a lot of recipes, but none of them are quite accurate.\n\nI spent the last three months trying various recipes and tinkering; I am happy to report I have finally cracked the code.  There are a lot of recipes that are very close , but they are missing a HUGE step.   There are also a whole lot of weird theories about the ingredients including crackers and chorizo, which are definitely inaccurate.\n\nLa Vic's orange sauce is a fermented.  This is the key step that I have seen missing from every recipe - fermentation.  It is what gives the orange sauce it's very special funk!  Someone on reddit indicated the recipes were wrong because they were missing fermentation.  Thanks to whoever said that, because that caused me to start tinkering more, until I figured out that by fermenting almost all the ingredients, you find the right flavor.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 4 small or 3 medium roma tomatoes, quartered\n* 1 medium jalapeno, quartered\n* 1 yellow onion, sliced into relatively thick rounds\n* 1 cup vegetable oil\n* 16 cloves of garlic\n* 1/2 cup dried, destemmed arbol chiles\n* 1/2 cup water\n* 3 dried and destemmed guajillo chiles\n* 1/2 tablespoon of kosher salt\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Start by roasting the garlic, onion, and tomato.  I broil for about 10 minutes on the highest setting and rack in my oven, flipping midway through.\n2. Let the garlic, onion, and tomato cool. Then ferment them, along with the jalapeno.  I did this in a brining solution for 10 days in a ball jar with a solution of 2.5 percent. I used this brine calculator to figure out how to brine.  [https://hakkobako.com/fermentation-brine-calculator/](https://hakkobako.com/fermentation-brine-calculator/)  I used a Ball fermentation kit with metal spring.\n3. After the 10 days, place the dried chiles in the oil and water and let soak for 30 minutes.\n4. Strain the fermentation liquid.\n5. Place the garlic, onion, jalapeno, tomato, salt and the oil/chile/water into a blender and blend until smooth.\n6. Strain the mixture through a mesh strainer to remove chunks and then transfer into containers.  I like these [https://www.walmart.com/ip/Expert-Grill-Squeeze-Sauce-Bottle-with-Attached-Cap-14-Ounce/493683320?athbdg=L1100](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Expert-Grill-Squeeze-Sauce-Bottle-with-Attached-Cap-14-Ounce/493683320?athbdg=L1100)\n7. Let sit overnight before eating.  Always refrigerate.  This should keep at least one month in the fridge.\n\nI have made this a few times and think it is a very accurate version of the La Vic's sauce.  It is right on the money flavor-wise.  I like to play with how much spice I add and sometimes skip roasting a few cloves of the garlic for extra intensity.  I hope this recipe spreads like wildfire because I know a lot of people have been looking for it for a very long time.  Let me know if you have feedback.\n\nedit: to add step 7\n\nedit 2: there are some questions in the comments about the safety of fermenting roasted ingredients.  I have read a bit on the internet about fermenting roasted ingredients, so I know its a thing.  I assume the lactic acid/bacteria you need to ferment in this recipe comes from the jalapeno.  I'm no expert though, so read below and do your own research.  I can tell you for sure that you can tell when something ferments because of the smell and taste, and when I have done this, always with the non-roasted jalapeno in the ferment, it has fermented and I live to type this...",

    "body": "December 17, 2024\n\nI set out to climb La Plata Peak in Colorado. I‚Äôve climbed many mountains before, including this one. My fitness was in great shape, I had just finished my 9th professional MMA fight just 10 days before. \n\nWe started off at about 5am, and the first two hours were cold, but great, as we moved above treeline the sun started to come up. It was a bit windy that day, maybe 30-40mph. But still a fantastic weather day. This climb started at 9,000ft altitude and ends above 14,000ft. The first mile was a breeze, a well packed in snow trench that didn‚Äôt require snowshoes or sinking (postholing). But after that first mile, in order to prevent crossing any dangerous avalanche terrain, we had to leave the trail and head straight to the northwest ridge of the mountain. Things got difficult here, as most of our steps, even with snowshoes, had us going knee and waist deep. We had a few water breaks, and this is where it all begins. \n\nI had an electrolyte drink, normally electrolyte drinks, atleast most of them, are not too high in carbs. Like <20 or so. Hiking at high altitudes usually causes my blood sugar to plummet to I tend to take less insulin on days where I have my fights or climb mountains. I usually don‚Äôt even take insulin for small snacks or electrolyte drinks and my sugar hangs out below 150, mainly due to the altitude and the insane amount of calories you burn. If you have ever climbed a mountain, especially in deep snow, you‚Äôll know the absurd amount of calories you can burn, it‚Äôs like several thousand. Anything you eat or drink goes right through you. But not this drink. I drank an electrolyte powder and I made the rookie mistake of not checking how many carbs were in it. Keep in mind, I already took less basal insulin too, but this drink had over 100 carbs!!!!!\n\nWe take our water break right before the most technical section know as the headwall. It‚Äôs a 500 wall you have to climb that you would not want to fall on, in order to gain the ridge that leads to the summit. We successfully get above the wall, and push toward the summit on the final 2000ft of the ridge. All is still going well until the final 1000ft, I start to feel extreme fatigue. \n\nI had just gotten over a nasty stomach bug just a few days prior, like 20 bathroom trips a day for 3 days!!!! And I chalked it up to that, like maybe I wasn‚Äôt fully recovered. \n\nI had had a CGM yet, I only started wearing one 3-4 weeks ago‚Ä¶it‚Äôs been a game changer for climbing mountains actually. And I do a pretty good job knowing how I feel regarding my blood sugar, if I feel a little low, I stop, check and having some quick sugars and get back to climbing. I‚Äôve never had a serious high sugar on a mountain. Atleast nothing above 250. So I didn‚Äôt think to check my sugars, as I was fully convinced it was from that stomach bug. After a hard push, I make it to the summit,  and the wind is just pounding us, I was so cold I didn‚Äôt even wanna take photos, I wanted to just get down. \n\nNormally climbing up is way more strenuous than climbing down. But with DKA, that‚Äôs not the case! Every step I took on the way down felt like knives in my chest and back. My joints felt I was 90 years old. I felt the absolute worst I‚Äôve ever felt in my life. Pure pain and misery. I had to stop and take a rest every 30 seconds. It was misery. My head hurt so bad. Like a 10/10 headache. \n\nWe get back to the headwall and I successfully descend the technical part and we put the snowshoes on and get ready to get down to our cars. This was the worst part.\n\nIf you have ever hiked in deep snow with snowshoes (trenching) you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs incredible taxing. Like a full body workout out to pull your legs up out of the knee-waist deep hole you just created with a heavy pack and snowshoes. \n\nEvery step felt like I was giving King Kong a piggy back ride. My low back hurt, SO BAD. By this point I was coughing up tons of mucous. It took literally every ounce of my mental willpower to get off that mountain on my own too feet. I‚Äôve done some pretty difficult stuff, preparing for fights requires a mental push in my opinion unlike any sport. I‚Äôve had cardio sessions that make me almost pass out just from the exhaustion. I‚Äôm no stranger to pain and suffering from training and exercise. But this was different, it was unlike any pain I felt before and I was genuinely afraid of how I was feeling. Something wasn‚Äôt right. I‚Äôve never felt like this before. \n\nWhen you combine diabetic ketoacidosis and an extreme activity like climbing a mountain (lots of lactic acid) my body basically became severely acidic. My blood PH basically became way too acidic. To me the lactic acid from the intense output on that mountain made the DKA FEEL much worse. \n\nAfter going to a very dark if not giving up in my mind, I make it back to the car. I get warm and I finally use my brain and think to check my sugar. I have good control on my numbers usually. I‚Äôm never above a 7% A1c and my time on range is usually about 80%. For some reason today I didn‚Äôt think to check, my sugar was almost 400. I instantly started googling DKA symptoms and the most pronounced one I had was called Kussmaul breathing, basically a constant deep breath you have to keep taking. It essentially is the body trying to remove acid from the breath I think? \n\nWe get to my friends house who lives nearby and I felt every ounce of pain. I almost blacked out going from the car to the inside of his house and I sat there in so much pain as I awaited the insulin to work. I chugged water too. Luckily I had ketone strips with me and I checked them and had large ketones. (The second highest on the little chart thing) \n\nThe only thing that kept me from the hospital was that I didn‚Äôt vomit. I was very nauseated but never vomited. \n\nI finally get back down to normal range and trace ketones and I felt safe enough for my roommate and I to drive home. I felt about 80% better the next morning, my lungs took about a few days to return to normalcy and not hack up mucous. I actually got a really bad chest cold 2 days after this event. I was basically out of commission from all exercise for a week. \n\nIt took me about 10 days to feel like I was back to normal with my endurance and strength. I‚Äôm sure the stomach bug and nasty cold on top of the DKA didn‚Äôt help. \n\nAll in all, I learned a valuable lesson all type 1s should know: don‚Äôt assume and get complacent. In my own treatment it‚Äôs easy to have it become second nature and skip steps, and assume sugars are in range. It was a good wake up call and was the decision I finally made to get my CGM. \n\nI now know how to recognize the DKA symptoms and I can safely say this will NEVER happen again. I‚Äôm grateful I was able to find the mental courage to keep pushing to get off that mountain that day.\n\nLast thing, no matter what you can chase your dreams with this disease. I was a hopeless, scared kid when I got this disease, but we must make the choice every day to be our best and let nothing stop us! \n\nI‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôve found this group and can share some of my stories with you all! Much love and keep fighting the good fight!\n\n\n ",

    "body": "We recently had a scare with our little guy, Greg. Seemingly out of the blue he had a pretty massive seizure that lasted about 2.5 mins. He‚Äôs 5 yrs old and we‚Äôve had him and our other dogs (Doxie mix RIP, and Pug mix 8yr) on FreshPet for about 2 years. \n\nAfter the seizure, he seemed perfectly fine for the next hour, and then we fed him. He immediately lost all sense of balance and was acting like he didn‚Äôt know who we were or where he was. \nCompletely disoriented. \n\nI wrapped him up in a little blanket and put him in my bed, where he laid for the next several hours, clearly not himself. Usually he‚Äôs bouncing around, playing, throwing toys off the bed just to see if I‚Äôll get them for him. Nothing. He laid in one spot and would shriek in pain when he tried to move even the slightest bit. \n\nWe weren‚Äôt able to take him to a 24hr vet, so we did a telehealth zoom meeting with a vet around 4am. She said it sounded neurological, but could also be liver. Take him to get bloodwork asap and contact her if he gets worse- prescribed him some gabapentin for pain, and looking back on the meeting, she never asked what we‚Äôve been feeding him, as every vet has done since I‚Äôve owned dogs. (My whole life)\n\nWhen he woke up he refused to get up to go outside, since he was in so much pain. The vet said it was due to the seizure causing lactic acid to build up in his muscles, like being sore after a workout\n\n I decided to Google ‚ÄúFreshPet dog seizures‚Äù \n\nI was shocked to discover dozens of testimonials from people who‚Äôs dogs have died as a result of eating FreshPet, many with identical symptoms to what Greg had \n\n\nI ran out to Petsmart and grabbed some fancy kibble and a topper that looked like chicken soup that I‚Äôd make at home. \n\nHe scarfed it down with zero hesitation \n\nAlmost immediately he seemed way batter. It‚Äôs been about a week, and he‚Äôs back to normal. \n\nLooking back, my older dog, Molly, whom I‚Äôd had for about 13 years, suddenly started having seizures and the vet told us she seemed healthy and that it must be an age thing. They said she‚Äôd easily be around another 3-4 years. \nShe only\nMade it another month \n\nthe type of seizure she had right before she died looked identical to how Greg was affected. \n\nI do think she died as a result of developing a toxicity to something in the food, and apparently it can build up and cause the liver to shut down \n\n\nTLDR: FreshPet nearly killed my little dude,\nAnd I suspect my other dog died from it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I then tried Farmers Dog. It was GREAT the first little while...then I got in a fight with them because my package came partially unthawed due to a shipping delay in the hotter part of the month. They thought it was OKAY TO FEED THOSE PACKAGES TO MY DOG, refused to refund anything, or ship me out a partial reshipment to cover what unthawed. I never recommend them to ANYONE they DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR DOG! \n\nIf you want fresh food to be honest I would actually make it yourself. Some stores have toppers you can add to ensure they're getting the correct nutrients from a fresh diet. I personally am feeding my doxie and shichon science diet mini bits for puppies. They love it and do great on it. Tameeka is back on her caesar diet because she really just won't eat anything else without getting issues, refuses all dry kibble to the point of starving herself to pain, and I just get her a multivitamin to cover the nutritional failures.",

    "body": "I was inspired by a YouTube series by the fancy face. She talks about her relationship with beauty brands in the context of having some sort of romantic relationship (ie. Brands she had one night stands with or bootie calls)\n\nI feel like I had relationships with the following brands but for various reason I step away from buying anything else or even checking out what these brands are up to\n\n1. Colourpop. This was a long term relationship. And the breakup was very gradual. Over the last year and a half, I‚Äôve gotten so bored with this brand. They have so many releases that looks the same, most which are too ashy for my liking. I loved how Colourpop was affordable yet very innovate. They have become greedy attention hoes. I don‚Äôt really think the products last very long either, I had to get rid of a lot of products because the quality got so bad so quick \n\n2. Morphe. This wasn‚Äôt a full blown relationship, but I was bamboozled by the marketing from the YouTube influencers when I was a young makeup enthusiast. Over the years they have shown us who morphe truly is, and I didn‚Äôt like what I saw. I  took off so fast \n\n3. Drunk elephant. I had a very intense relationship with this brand. I couldn‚Äôt live without the vitamin c day serum and the moisturizer. After a while It just became obvious that I wasn‚Äôt getting the desired results for the price of the their products. I found Korean brands that were cheaper and gave better results. Haven‚Äôt looked back since \n\n4. Sunday Riley. This was a very brief  and hurtful relationship. I was manipulated by the marketing, the reviews and the longevity of the brand. The lactic acid serum completely destroyed my skin. It left my skin so thin, and so dry, my acne worsened, I had a horrible time. And to think I spent so much money on this brand. I feel cheated, used and abused. I will NEVER go back \n\n5 . Juvia‚Äôs Place. This was such a fun relationship. They introduced me to colorful eyeshadows. it was so much fun going through their website to pick out a new colorful palette. I broke up with juvia‚Äôs place, not because they did anything, it was all me realizing that I dont really use colorful eyeshadows. I just like looking and swatching, rarely do I wear it. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I feel like I have all the colors they could possibly offer.\n\n6 . TooFaced. This was a weird relationship. I never really liked this brand. It was more like you are here and bored let‚Äôs do this, type of thing. The products were just alright, everything seems gimmicky and strange. We are just too different\n\n\nWhich brands have you broken up with?",

I fell in love with many things that I wouldn't have tried if not for the nice packaging, good quality, and cheap price point. (colourful eyeliners or dark lipsticks). It was a relationship that gave me experience in what I like.\n2. Drunk Elephant taught me patience. I was obsessed with skincare as well so I often had bottles upon bottles of skincare products in my house, but I was never in a committed relationship with them. I finally decided to use a skincare product up in its entirety and what better why to do that by spending even more money on brand new products. While I did have some results after using up their C Firma and TLC Framboos Serums, it wasn't what I was looking for. So even though I finally decided to devote time and money to this relationship, it didn't last and I've moved on to a variety of other brands (while keeping that mentality of actually having a routine).\n3. Charlotte Tilbury taught me pain. It's beautiful packaging laced with elegance drew me in, but the disappointing results with their eyeshadows that don't last on my lids and their lack of social awareness drove me away. (no one needs to sleep in makeup Charlotte)\n\nthank u, next",

For me, subculture was so different, the color story was so unique and I had nothing similar (in the form of a palette, I did have some singles that came close but not enough) to anything I already had in my collection. I bought it right away and boy was that a huge disappointment. The shadows were packed so lose it felt like I was dipping my brush into a loose pigment and they blended into a muddy looking mess. I took it right back because no matter what I did I couldn‚Äôt get it to work right, I then took to twitter to express my frustration to find out that others had a similar experience especially big influencers so I knew then I didn‚Äôt get a bad palette from a poor quality batch. Norvina and her minions threw major shade at those creators who posted less than positive reviews and to those customers who were frustrated with the palette and said something along the lines that pro MUAs would know how to work this palette. That pissed me off, because ABH main consumers were everyday people not professional MUAs. I took a break from them and then came release after release, norvina launched around 7-8 palettes in one single year, the only one I have a chance to was Jackie Aina because I loved the color story and I like Jackie. But none of those creators got their moment to shine, and then they chose to partner and collaborate with an MLM, they have this weird obsession with mercury and retrograde (I honestly don‚Äôt understand this). The infamous PR searches, their treatment of staff and trying to take advantage of smaller creators by asking them for exclusive ABH content and then paying with exposure, not to mention how Norvina is the worst person for the job she‚Äôs got, she has no idea how to talk to people or handle situations when ABH isn‚Äôt being praised.

You see, our chins are actually very unique environments which results in a really specific type of acne with very specific causes and treatments. Some people will have acne everywhere on their faces and bodies but some people will frustratingly develop persistent acne on just their chins and jaws. This post is specifically intended as a resource for people who find that their primary location of persistent breakouts is on their chin.\n\nAs it so happens, I also suffered from seemingly treatment resistant chin acne and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern. I hope this resource is helpful!\n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* Acne is an incredibly diverse condition with many causes and treatment courses and will always be unique to the individual struggling with it. While I will do my best to be as thorough as possible in my explanations and recommendations, it‚Äôs both possible and likely that I‚Äôm not able to detail every circumstance resulting in your personal case. This is meant to be a high level guide to serve as a jumping off point.¬†\n* Speaking about acne requires sensitivity to very real personal implications. This post is not intended to moralize or act as a judgment of anyone struggling with acne. It is not a commentary on anyone‚Äôs personal hygiene, hormone profile, lifestyle, or environment.¬†\n* There are a few conditions that can present similarly to acne present on the chin such as rosacea, perioral dermatitis, herpes simplex, allergies and autoimmune conditions, impetigo, hand foot and mouth disease, staph, and others. These will not respond to the same treatments as acne and should be addressed by a medical professional to properly diagnose and create a treatment plan for.\n* Shaving may also cause acne-like legions, but these are the result of irritation and ingrown hairs that also will not respond to the same treatment as acne. I will write a separate post on shaving in the near future to hopefully address these.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't promote any products I've formulated myself. In spite of this being a heavily researched piece, please bear in mind that it also at its core an opinion piece. I also did not utilize AI for any portion of this post.\n\nThis is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:chin and jawline acne. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need:\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Chin Acne\n2.

Types of Chin Acne\n\n  \nLike acne that appears on other areas of the face and body, chin acne can take a few different forms. Knowing the types of acne breakouts can help you understand the underlying causes and is key to figuring out how to treat them.\n\n**Blackheads:** Blackheads happen when your pores become partially clogged and the trapped debris oxidizes to a dark brown/black color. Because the top of the pore remains open, blackheads are known as ‚Äúopen comedones.‚Äù\n\n**Whiteheads:** Whiteheads happen when your pores become clogged all the way through causing a small white bump at the top. Whiteheads are known as ‚Äúclosed comedones‚Äù as the pore is completely blocked by debris. These are generally very small.\n\n**Papules:** Papules are raised red bumps that form when oil, dirt or excess skin cells block a pore and mix with bacteria on your skin. This bacterial infection extends into the surrounding skin creating an inflamed legion. Papules do not contain pus, thus they don‚Äôt really form a white point like you see with whiteheads or pustules.\n\n**Pustules:** Pustules are raised bumps with a white center surrounded by red, inflamed skin. They‚Äôre like the 2.0 version of a whitehead. They form when a pore becomes blocked by oil, dirt, or dead skin cells and gets infected to the point of creating a yellowish/white pus that‚Äôs visible under the skin, sometimes coming to a distinct peak.¬†\n\n**Nodules:** Nodular acne occurs very deep within the skin. They can produce red or flesh-colored bumps at the surface, but they frustratingly may not appear to come to a definitive point. They are hard to the touch and are caused when the deepest part of a clogged pore gets infected. Nodular acne feels sore, or like there is a pressure under the skin.\n\n**Cystic:** Cystic acne, also known as acne cysts or blind pimples, are large, painful, pus-filled clogged pores that have become infected. They may not come to a definitive point on the surface and are fairly soft to the touch. They develop deep in the skin but create a red appearance at the surface. Like nodular acne, they often feel like a sore pressure point, but it‚Äôs difficult to really see where they are because they don‚Äôt form a peak or point, just an amorphous bump.¬†\n\n\n\n# 2. What Causes Chin Acne aka Why is This Area Unique?\n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of chin and jawline acne, but this is a very unique spot which is worth discussing in detail. Generally, acne forms as a the result of a combination of bodily and environmental factors, but the chin and jawline have a few things going on that makes this area particularly interesting.\n\nFirst, I want to quickly discuss what causes acne to form in general:\n\n**Oil Production:** Oil on the skin, also known as sebum is the primary variable in the great equation of acne formation. Oil production is largely influenced by genetics, but it can be triggered by exposure to certain environmental factors. Many types of acne form around sebum that‚Äôs produced and then trapped in pores when combined with other things like dead skin cells, bacteria, and dirt. Sebum in an of itself is not bad, in fact it‚Äôs essential to maintaining the health of your skin, but preventing it from combining with acne-causing bacteria is key.\n\n**Comedogenic Reactions:** When sebum combines with other gunk, especially stuff that‚Äôs non water soluble, pores will sometimes clog. A comedogenic reaction is when a pore becomes blocked as a result of the accumulation of materials that cannot easily be cleared. This can happen with natural ‚Äúgunk‚Äù like dead skin cells and environmental grime, but it can also happen with products that we apply to our skin such as skincare, makeup, SPF, and in some cases our hair products. Side note on this, there isn‚Äôt a generally accepted scale of comedogenic reactivity even though there are claims of one existing. Everyone is different, and certain things may trigger a comedogenic reaction in one person but not another.¬†\n\n**Bacteria:** When bacteria enters the picture, clogged pores can go from simply being blocked to infected. This infection will trigger an immune response from the body, usually resulting in inflammation, redness, pain, and in some cases the production of pus. This is the difference between black/whiteheads and pimples/nodules/cysts.¬†\n\n**Genetics:** Your genetics can greatly influence how prone you are to acne, what type, and at what severity. Genetics will predetermine certain aspects of your skin such as:¬†\n\n* The size of your pores and how prone they are to blockage\n* Your natural level of sebum production¬†\n* The rate at which you shed old/dead skin cells and replace them with new ones¬†\n* Your hormonal levels and sensitivity to them\n* If you will have an allergic or inflammatory response when exposed to certain stressors, ingredients, or environmental factors\n\n**Skin Barrier Disruption:** Acne that forms as a result of skin barrier disruption is a form of an inflammatory reaction. Skin barrier disruption can occur when skin is exposed to environmental factors such as extreme heat or cold, dry air, wind, or pollution. It can also occur due to exposure to too many active or drying ingredients such as chemical/manual exfoliants, antioxidants, antiseptics, etc.¬†\n\nExcessive exposure to these environmental factors and/or active ingredients can irritate and inflame the skin, disrupting the pH, triggering an immune reaction that results in pain, redness, and swelling. When the skin barrier is disrupted in this manner, it will often produce excess sebum in an attempt to moisturize the skin and rebalance its pH. During this time, the skin is less able to stave off bacteria and other environmental stressors which often mix with this excess sebum resulting in acne and breakouts.¬†\n\n**Diet:** There is a great deal of controversy as to whether or not diet contributes to acne. It‚Äôs possible that foods themselves may cause acne through skin contact (more on that right below) and it‚Äôs possible that your body may react in certain ways that can trigger acne when certain foods are consumed, such as an inflammatory response or as a response to something like hormones in dairy products. Whether or not certain foods contribute to acne can be a purely personal experience. There‚Äôs no single body of research that can tell us one way or the other, many studies are conflicting, and it‚Äôs very difficult to objectively test when everyone‚Äôs own experience seems to differ.\n\n**B Vitamin Breakouts:** Now, there isn‚Äôt an established clinical consensus on this either, but there‚Äôs anecdotal evidence to suggest that certain B vitamins contribute to acne by possibly promoting sebum production. These include things like B12, biotin, and B complexes that can appear in multivitamins and in supplements that are marketed for promoting ‚Äúhair, skin and nail health.‚Äù There‚Äôs also no clinical evidence to suggest a direct link between B vitamins and skin/hair/nail health except for the operating theory that in increasing sebum production, they promote healthy development in these areas, but for people who are prone to acne, it also seems to trigger breakouts. This isn‚Äôt unique to just the chin area, but it may be worth evaluating your supplements if you‚Äôre finding an increase in acne with use of supplements that feature B vitamins.¬†\n\n**Hormones:** This gets its own section‚Ä¶.\n\n  \n**But why my chin/jaw** ***specifically*****??**\n\nFor people who struggle with acne on just their chin or jawline, this is a really common question, and the answer is part of the reason I believe it requires a unique approach to treating. Chin acne is the result of two things:\n\n**Gravity and Proximity to Your Mouth:** All the time we spend upright means that stuff on the surface of our skin will migrate downward over the course of the day. Now this is true for other areas of your face, sometimes our hair products migrate down to our foreheads, our eye makeup onto our cheeks. But what makes the chin particularly problematic for acne is not only do we have this drift of face stuff to this area, we also have our mouths.¬†\n\nOur mouths are full of bacteria, and even if you don‚Äôt spend all day drooling on yourself, that bacteria can spread downward as a result of talking, laughing, coughing, sneezing, licking our lips, even just normal breathing. *Propionibacterium* *acnes* and *staphylococcus* *epidermidis* are bacteria that can originate in the mouth and migrate outward and downward causing acne legions. To a lesser extent, we also see some bacterial transfer from the hands as the chin/jawline tend to be high touch points.\n\nOur mouths are also where we eat. Even if you‚Äôre the most careful eater in the world, many times you‚Äôll get some degree of food debris on your chin. Even though I just mentioned that there‚Äôs no general consensus on whether or not diet contributes to acne, it‚Äôs possible that the act of putting food in our mouths can; that getting even trace amounts of stuff like grease and sugar on the skin around our mouth can contribute to clogged pores and bacterial proliferation.¬†\n\n\n\n# 3. What Exactly is Hormonal Acne and Why Does it Affect My Chin?\n\nEveryone‚Äôs biological processes are dictated in part by the influence of hormones in our system, but the link between hormones and acne isn‚Äôt as simple as ‚ÄúI have hormones, *ergo* I have acne.‚Äù Understanding the environment in which hormones contribute to the formation of acne can help us with more realistic treatments than just ‚Äústop the hormones.‚Äù\n\nThe reason hormones cause acne is that androgen hormones (aka male hormones like testosterone, DHEAS,¬†DHEA, and¬†androstenedione) influence the production of sebum in the skin: it increases as they go up, and decreases as they go down. A breakdown of the actual process is as follows:\n\n1. Oil producing sebaceous glands are powerful androgen receptors, producing more sebum when they collect more androgen hormones or convert their precursors. This causes oil production on skin and a build up of that sebum in the pores.¬†\n2. Androgens themselves may also clog pores causing comedones to be formed.\n3. DHEAS is also inflammatory by nature, triggering immune response T cells to show up in and around clogged pores.\n\nThe levels of these androgen hormones can be globally elevated (as is the case with PCOS in females or generally for males with high testosterone naturally or supplemented, hence backne with steroid use) or they can fluctuate. This is why women sometimes breakout during their periods: it‚Äôs the downstream effect of elevated androgen hormones in the luteal phase when estrogen and progesterone naturally decrease.¬†\n\nAs mentioned prior, B vitamins can also have this effect by triggering androgen receptors even though they themselves are not androgen hormones or their precursors.¬†\n\nDue to the aforementioned reasons as to why the chin in particular is an area where we find the best ingredients for acne, we can see why increased sebum production from elevated androgens would result in breakouts there. Now, the knee jerk reaction may be to stop or reduce those hormones ‚Äî and there are ways to do that such as using/stopping birth control pills or other forms of hormone replacement or suppression ‚Äî but while these may work as an acne treatment, it‚Äôs an option you should only discuss with your doctor if appropriate for you.\n\nThere are other ways to address hormonal causes of acne such as the medication spironolactone or spearmint herbal tea. Spiro is a diuretic that‚Äôs been proven to block androgen receptors and spearmint is thought to have a similar effect but I have yet to find a study specifically supporting this, at least not to the rigor I would like to recommend this in earnest.¬†\n\nGenerally, for those who either can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to use interventions that affect their hormone profiles or take androgen blocking medications, the most reasonable intervention is to temper the environment in which acne forms on the skin through the use of topicals and skin care. The reason I mention all of this is to pull back the curtain on what exactly ‚Äúhormonal acne‚Äù means so you can address the resulting sebum that‚Äôs ultimately forming acne legions. This is where we look at the ingredients specifically proven to address the environment on your skin.\n\n\n\n# 4. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 1: The Ingredients\n\nWhen looking for skincare products to treat and prevent chin and jawline acne, it‚Äôs important to look for ingredients that can help encourage skin cell turnover, curb sebum production, kill off acne-causing bacteria, clear clogged pores, and block harmful UV rays.¬†\n\nNow, this is not actually as extensive of a list as you might expect. There are lots of ingredients that target acne, including new and novel ones coming onto the market all the time. I‚Äôm choosing to focus on ones that are clinically studied and have the most compelling evidence, ones that have worked the best for myself and people that I‚Äôve worked with, recommendations from dermatologists and formulators, and ones that are more readily accessible. I also find that having a consistent routine that includes proper cleansing is just as important as what you're using, as well as limiting the number of topicals to prevent the dreaded moisture barrier disruption which can have a backfire effect.¬†\n\nThis also isn‚Äôt a shopping list. You don‚Äôt have to have or use all of these things to treat chin acne, but I‚Äôll get into that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets acne based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include:\n\n**Retinoids**¬†that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat chin and jawline acne by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help prevent dead skin cells from clogging pores. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen acne if you overdo it and damage your skin barrier. Lastly Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms.\n\n**Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)** are water-soluble chemical exfoliants. Solubility of skincare ingredients matters because the natural moisturizer of the skin is our sebum, which is oil. Water-soluble ingredients don‚Äôt dissolve in oil, thus they do not penetrate into the pores as deeply. This, however, is not actually a downside, it means that these types of ingredients work on the top layers of the skin which is great for acne. Common AHAs that are used to fight acne include glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid. There are numerous others, but these are the most promising and well-researched. Use of AHAs helps breakup and remove dead skin cells which prevents them from clogging pores. And while pore size cannot be reduced, AHAs can help reduce the dilation that happens when pores fill up with gunk. ¬†\n\n**Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA)** is an oil-soluble chemical exfoliant, the most well known of which is salicylic acid. Remember Stridex pads? Those are salicylic acid! Because BHA is oil-soluble, it dissolves in the skin‚Äôs natural sebum which pulls it deeper into the pores. This causes deeper exfoliation which makes this an effective ingredient for combatting deeper forms of acne. The caveat is, since it works in deeper levels, the risk of irritation is higher. But when carefully used especially when featured in cleansers, BHA is a very effective method of treating and preventing acne.\n\n**Azelaic Acid** has both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties making this one of my all around favorite skincare ingredients due to it‚Äôs ability to both kill off acne-causing bacteria as well as reduce redness and acne scarring. It‚Äôs also a mild chemical exfoliant that helps strip away dead skin cells much like AHAs and BHAs. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths.\n\n**Niacinamide or Vitamin B3** is a skin soother that decreases inflammation, but its real power is that it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne. It works by¬†inhibiting the enzyme ‚Äúsebaceous lipase‚Äù which is part of the process of oil production in the pores. Ironically, it‚Äôs a form of vitamin B3, but unlike ingested B vitamins that might trigger acne, as a topical it actually helps prevent acne. Like AHAs/BHA it can also reduce the dilation of pores which can make them appear smaller. Now, there are some people who are sensitive to niacinamide. I cannot find any studies to support why this may be, or if perhaps people are reacting to other ingredients in products that contain it, but if you find you do not tolerate niacinamide well, it‚Äôs best to skip it.\n\n**Benzoyl Peroxide** is an antiseptic which means it makes the environment incredibly inhospitable for bacterial proliferation. Unlike antibiotics that kill bacteria (which can contribute to antibiotic resistance), benzoyl peroxide as an antiseptic simply makes life miserable for bacteria so they fail to thrive and cause acne. Benzoyl peroxide is usually found in two forms, either as a leave-on topical or in face washes. Like many of the other ingredients listed here, it can be sensitizing with overuse, and in the leave-on form, it can sometimes bleach your clothes, but it‚Äôs an incredibly effective way to curb the proliferation of bacteria on the chin. It‚Äôs also one of the active ingredients in prescription Epiduo or Epiduo forte, which is compounded benzoyl peroxide and the retinoid adapalene. Benzoyl peroxide is generally available in concentrations of 5 and 10%.¬†\n\n**Sulphur** is‚Ä¶. Sulphur. It does a couple things (other than stinking) when applied to treat acne. It helps absorb excess oil, it dries out dead skin cells to make them easier to clear away, it has some antiseptic properties especially against chin-loving *propionibacterium* *acnes*, and it‚Äôs also a mild exfoliant. It comes in two forms usually, as a face wash or as a leave-on mask or spot treatment. This can be a good substitute for benzoyl peroxide. Sulphur allergies or sensitivities are common, so it‚Äôs important to check for any reactivity you might have.\n\n**SPF**¬†represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily have an effect on preventing chin acne, but it is necessary to use when using active ingredients to fight acne. Just use it.\n\n\n\n# 5. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n\nAlright, let‚Äôs get to it. I‚Äôm providing two paths to take: a gentler option for more sensitive skin and a heavier-hitting option if your skin is more resilient to actives. But first, irrespective of your skin, there‚Äôs one really important part of the routine worth exploring if you suffer with chin and jawline acne which is getting your oral health dialed.\n\nI discovered this accidentally and then was able to later confirm with a dermatologist and dentist that the effect here can be real. A few years ago I decided to do Invisalign and I actually noticed my chin breakouts reduced significantly in part because I was brushing my teeth, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash as much as 10 times per day depending on how often I was drinking or eating.\n\nNow, you don‚Äôt need to be doing that quite as often, but what I‚Äôve found to be effective against chin acne is the following:\n\n**In the morning:**\n\n1. Scrape your tongue using a tongue scraper.\n2. Rinse and gargle with a mouthwash of your choosing and wait 5 or 10 minutes. This is a good time to do your skincare. I personally like CloSYS mouthwash.\n3. Brush your teeth but don‚Äôt rinse with water and avoid eating or drinking for a little while.\n\n**Throughout the day:**\n\n1. Keep a little travel bottle of mouthwash with you and if you can, swish a little after anytime you eat or drink (anything that isn‚Äôt just plain flat water.) This helps curb some of that bacteria that likes to meander out of your mouth and onto your chin. I have a 3oz refillable bottle that I fill every few days and just keep it in my bag.\n2. If you‚Äôre not able to rinse with mouthwash, swish your mouth with plain, flat water after eating or drinking. This helps clear away food/drink residue that oral bacteria proliferate in.¬†\n\n**In the evening:**\n\n1. Scrape your tongue.\n2. Floss, and really get in there. SO many people don‚Äôt floss thoroughly enough. Many of the bacteria associated with chin acne are elevated in people with gum disease.¬†\n3. Rinse and gargle with your mouthwash. Wait 5 to 10 minutes, again this is a great time to do your skincare.¬†\n4. Brush your teeth and again, don‚Äôt rinse with water after.\n\nIf you can stick with an oral hygiene routine like this, for a lot of people struggling with chin acne, it‚Äôs half the battle. And I know it might seem obvious, like ‚Äúof course I brush my teeth!!!‚Äù but adding maintenance steps through the day and *really flossing* are two of the biggest parts that plenty of people fail to do regularly. These are also great steps to take if you f\\*cking hate getting manhandled at the dentist.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about the actual skincare portion. Since this is targeted, you can apply the actives to just your chin area or your whole face if you would like. It‚Äôs up to you. Just be sure you get thorough coverage of your whole face when cleansing, moisturizing, and applying SPF.\n\n\n\n# The Gentle Routine\n\n**AM routine ‚Äî In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n1: Niacinamide\\*\\*\n\n2: Azelaic acid\n\n3: Moisturizer\n\n4: SPF\n\n\n\n**For Niacinamide,** I have been extremely happy with the Ordinary‚Äôs Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%. \\*\\***If you can‚Äôt tolerate niacinamide**, you can skip this step and instead use **Effaclar Mat Oil-Free Mattifying Moisturizer from La Roche Posay** as your moisturizer step.\n\n**For Azelaic acid,** Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only drugstore one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. For a semi-RX, Dermatica has both a 15 and 20% ‚ÄúClarifying Azelaic Acid Cream‚Äù which can be purchased directly from their site.¬†\n\n**For Moisturizer,** it‚Äôs tempting to go with one formulated for acne or oil control, but I generally recommend a light and sheer moisturizer. I really like Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion (the one for face and body). If you need a niacinamide(B3)-free option Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer is a good option.\n\n**For SPF,** I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin as this can be sensitizing for some, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD. Find one that you like and that you will wear.\n\n\n\n**PM routine: In order of application:**\n\n1: Gentle cleanse\n\n2a: Adapalene (Mon/Wed/Fri, start with 1x per week and build to 3x)\n\n2b: AHA (Sun)¬†\n\n3: Moisturizer  \n\n\n**To Gentle Cleanse**, this is a two-step process. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. If you need something a little stronger to breakup makeup or more stubborn SPF, Clinique ‚ÄúTake the Day Off‚Äù makeup remover is a great alternative. Then massage in a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser, and rinse.\n\n**For Adapalene**, OTC Differin cream is the one you‚Äôre going to want to go with as it‚Äôs the easiest prescription-strength retinoid to get without seeing a doctor. Apply a pea-sized amount. Oddly enough, of all the retinoids I‚Äôve tried, my chin acne has responded the most to adapalene. I like to start people at once a week and build to 3 times per week, up to daily if you can tolerate it. If you‚Äôre using the AHA next step though, keep at least one day adapalene-free so you can also have an exfoliation day.\n\n**For AHA,** the one I like to go with that provides gentle, yet effective exfoliation is lactic acid. Lactic acid also binds to water which makes it a really good hydrating ingredient as well. The Ordinary‚Äôs Lactic Acid + HA in either 5 or 10% is a good one.¬†  \n\n\n# The Heavier-Hitting Routine\n\n**AM routine ‚Äî This will be the same as the AM portion of the gentle routine, no need to go crazy. Pop back up there for that.**\n\n**PM routine: In order of application:**\n\n1: Benzoyl peroxide cleanse\n\n2a: Adapalene (Mon/Wed/Fri, start with 1x per week and build to 3x)\n\n2b: BHA (Sun)\n\n3: Moisturizer\n\n\n\nThis might not seem terribly different from the Gentle Routine, but both benzoyl peroxide cleansing and the introduction of a BHA can be particularly a\\*s kicking if your skin isn‚Äôt ready for it.\n\n**For Benzoyl Peroxide Cleanser,** first you will do a gentle cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser to breakup your SPF and do a first pass on your skin. Massage in and rinse completely, then follow with Differin Daily Deep Cleanser. Depending on your tolerance, you can rinse this off right after massaging into skin, or you can let it sit for a few minutes (3 at the most) before rinsing. If you find your skin getting really irritated by this, switch to the gentle routine.¬†\n\n**For Adapalene**, OTC Differin cream will work here, just like in the gentle routine.\n\n**For a BHA**, also called salicylic acid, there are a couple options I like. Paula‚Äôs Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant or the Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution are great options. This can be very sensitizing though, especially in a routine that includes a retinoid so only use once or twice per week and not on the same night as your adapalene.\n\n\n\n# 6. Is it Fungal Acne?\n\nIf the routines don‚Äôt seem to be working for you, it‚Äôs possible that you may have fungal acne. Fungal acne can show up on your chin for the same reason regular acne can, except instead of being cause by bacteria, it‚Äôs caused by an overgrowth of yeast. Fungal acne can have a distinct appearance, it‚Äôs similar to whiteheads/closed comedones with small, clustered white or flesh colored bumps, and it might not appear as red and inflamed as pustules/papules. There is some controversy as to whether or not fungal acne is a thing (mostly as a matter of semantics, it‚Äôs not technically a form of *Acne vulgaris*, rather *Pityrosporum folliculitis* or *Malassezia folliculitis*), but if you‚Äôre not successful with the routines above and you can rule out other medical conditions, it may be worth treating your case like fungal acne.\n\nThe solution to this is a simple one: cleanse your face with an antidandruff shampoo a few times per week ‚ÄîHead and Shoulder, Selsun Blue, Nizoral are great ones. Let it sit on your skin for a few minutes before rinsing, then top with a basic moisturizer. If you have a combination of fungal and regular acne, you can do this as your cleansing step a few times per week with the rest of the steps in the routine. If you just have fungal acne, you can literally just do this and follow with your moisturizer and SPF during the day. If it persists, talk to your doctor about a prescription anti-fungal.\n\n\n\n# 7. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Gone Too Far With the Actives‚Äù¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs tempting to go nuts with the actives in an attempt to quickly stave off chin acne, but this can cause severe irritation that can actually contribute to more breakouts. The skin cell turnover cycle is about 30 days which means that it will generally take a few weeks to start seeing improvements with a new routine. Most people will know if a routine is working within 3 to 6 months, but a quick way to know if it‚Äôs not working because you‚Äôve overdone it is if you experience a damaged moisture barrier which can happen as quickly as within a few days.\n\nA damaged moisture barrier is an injury to the skin that can be caused by using too many actives and is akin to a chemical burn. There are a few telltale ways to know if this is happened: first, the skin will have a really distinct feel. It will feel tight and dry, but confusingly, it may be very oily at the same time. It may also appear red and inflamed, it may peel or appear to crack, and it may burn, itch, or sting even when you apply inert topicals like a basic moisturizer.¬†\n\nThe confounding thing is that in this state, your skin will produce more oil to try to calm everything down, but because the immune system is working on healing the damaged skin, it‚Äôs less able to stave off acne causing bacteria. So not only are you very uncomfortable and inflamed, you‚Äôre also probably going to have more breakouts. Healing acne means striking a gentle balance with your actives, but if you find that you have disrupted your moisture barrier, you should pull everything back until it stabilizes.¬†\n\nI recommend dropping your routine down to absolute basics: In the morning, rinse with lukewarm water, use a gentle moisturizer like Cetaphil or Vanicream, and top with SPF. In the evening, double cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and then Cetaphil Daily Cleanser, then top with your moisturizer and/or an occlusive like Vaseline or La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm. Stick with this until your skin feels normal again, and if you want, very slowly reintroduce your actives, or switch some of the recommended products for others that I‚Äôve mentioned to see if there‚Äôs something else you get along with.\n\n\n\n# 8. Nuclear Options\n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC and drugstore topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the dermatology route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office RX treatments easier and more effective. Generally, a doctor will be able to prescribe prescription-strength versions of many of the things I‚Äôve already listed, or they will add oral medications. But by doing as much as you can with drugstore products AND ensuring you can stick with a consistent routine, you can make the most of your continued work with a dermatology.\n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nThis list also doesn‚Äôt include hormone-related treatments. If you believe a hormonal intervention is right for you, it‚Äôs best to talk to your doctor specifically about your individual needs.¬†\n\nFor tougher-to-treat chin acne, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting topicals and medications to discuss with a dermatologist that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options.\n\n*This does not constitute medical advice, it is intended to act as a guide for you to discuss with your dermatologist or medical provider.*\n\n**Medical Grade Peels:**¬†Medical grade chemical peels can be done in dermatology offices. High concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used for acne. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup. I recommend this over seeing an esthetician for peels.¬†\n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:**¬†This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. These would be used in place of the OTC adapalene I mentioned in the routine if prescribed by your provider. There is a stronger prescription-strength adapalene as well as a compounded medication called Epiduo or Epiduo Forte, which combines adapalene with Benzoyl Peroxide. You should be mindful that it can bleach clothes and sheets if you are prescribed it. Aside from the ones already mentioned, common forms of prescription retinoids include: Altreno, Tazorac, Fabior, and Trifarotene (Aklief). They vary wildly in cost in availability so I recommend asking to start with generic options first before asking your doctor for brandname acne medication.\n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:**¬†This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid such as Finacea and Azelex. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, but it can also be an effective acne treatment for its antiseptic properties.\n\n**Topical Antibiotics:** Topical erythromycin and clindamycin can be helpful in killing off acne causing bacteria but you need to be careful of developing antibiotic resistance. I am of the opinion that a topical antibiotic course should not exceed 90 days, but your doctor will know better based on your case. It may be helpful however to ask your doctor exactly how long you should be on a topical antibiotic, how you will know if it‚Äôs working, if they have a plan for you to gradually wean off of it, and what their recommendation for replacement would be after you have finished your course. Typically, a doctor will transition you to a topical retinoid or other medication following an antibiotic course. It‚Äôs good to have a clear plan prior to starting a topical antibiotic.\n\n**Oral Antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics like doxycycline and minocycline are sometimes prescribed for severe acne cases and are usually the last line of defense before the ultimate treatment which I will get into next. It‚Äôs generally recommended to exhaust all other possible topical treatments before turning to this sort of intervention as oral antibiotics can have numerous side effect (such as hyperpigmentation, nausea, severe photo reactivity) and can also contribute to systemic antibiotic resistance. However, short (1 to 3 months) or infrequence courses of oral antibiotics can be effective in treating acne and helping prevent the repopulation of acne-causing bacteria. Like topical antibiotics, it‚Äôs important to have a clear plan with your doctor to understand how long you will be on it, how you will know if it‚Äôs working, and what you will transition to using after the course is finished. Having a routine to support an oral antibiotic is key to longterm success even after your course is finished.\n\n**Oral Tretinoin:** Also called isotretinoin or accutane, this is the true nuclear option for acne, chin or otherwise. Like its topical counterpart, oral tretinoin works by increasing skin cell turnover. Generally, it‚Äôs only used in severe cases as the courses are often long, fraught with side effects, and require lifestyle adjustments such as abstinence from alcohol and regular blood draws for liver enzyme and cholesterol monitoring. However for many people, the side effects are minimal, and the reduction in acne often outweighs the temporary discomfort of the treatment course. Many people can go years or even the rest of their lives without a severe reoccurrence of acne following an oral tretinoin course.¬†\n\n‚Äî\n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! This concludes my comprehensive guide on chin acne. I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

I tried it a couple of times, and it made my skin scaly and flaky for days (even on my eyelids and lower neck where I didn‚Äôt apply it). Is the move to cut this, or to try to sandwich it between moisturizer?\n\nI have acne on my chin and around my mouth that also gets into my jawline / below my chin. Would you say the root causes and treatments stand for these areas too?\n\nI have what I think are pretty visible milia on my chin - sometimes it looks like one will get inflamed and turn into a pustule. Any pro tips for those, or just follow the above?\n\nLast one - I did two courses of accutane about 10 years ago, but here we are with acne at 31 (less severe though). My derm has offered a third course as an option - if the first two didn‚Äôt stick, is it worth it? Cautious about the health risks too as someone who wants to conceive down the line\n\nAppreciate you!",

    "body": "If you've been a part of this subreddit for longer than a week, you've probably heard the abbreviations \"AHA\" and \"BHA\" tossed around fairly regularly. That's because we *love* chemical exfoliants here on this subreddit, and I'm here to explain to you the difference and which you should try (skin type dependent).\n\n**To start, an AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\"** To put it simply, alpha hydroxy acid is your dead skin \"detacher.\" Imagine your skin as many cells, held together by a \"glue.\" AHA works by loosening up this glue and letting the cells fall away easier. This helps to reveal brighter, healthier, and plumper skin beneath. It is most commonly found in the following three forms: Glycolic, lactic, and mandelic. \n\n* **Glycolic**. The most common of all the AHAs, this acid has the smallest molecular structure, which allows it to be the most effectual on the skin but also the most potentially irritating. I recommend looking for it in low concentrations if you are new to AHA products -- 8-10%. Alpha Hydrox is a commonly recommended line of glycolic acid products. Has a mild humectant property.\n* **Lactic**. The second most common of all the AHAs. This is the basis for the beloved St. Ives pads. The molecular structure is larger than AHA but not as large as mandelic. It is highly recommended for sensitive skin types, such as rosacean skin. Lactic acid is also milk derived. It has great humectant properties.\n* **Mandelic**. The least common, but one of the best choices for acne-prones. It has a large molecular structure, meaning it takes longer to work its magic on skin and is thus less irritating. It is also anti-bacterial/anti-microbial. It is derived from bitter almonds. Mandelic also has moderate humectant properties.\n\nMany studies also have proven that AHAs increase dermal thickness and improve collagen density as well as quality of elastic fibers.\n\n* [SOURCE 1](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [SOURCE 2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x/abstract;jsessionid=8F1BD9BC1178A87ADF7E90B6EBD17F44.d02t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false)\n* [SOURCE 3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [SOURCE 4](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false)\n\nAHAs are a great choice for dry skin -- they all have some humectant properties (meaning they hold moisture to the skin) and are water-soluable. This means they work best on bare, clean skin. \n\nIf you are using the OCM, I highly recommend wiping away much of the oil before application, as excessive amounts of oil will inhibit the AHA's full effectiveness. A residue should not make too much of a difference, however. \n\nIf you wish to buffer AHA, simply put a small amount in with your moisturizer at night. \n\nYour routine would look something like this (water soluble -> oil soluble):\n\n* Cleanse -> Pat dry -> Toners -> AHA -> Serums -> Moisturizers -> Any additional occlusives (ie. Vaseline) -> Sunscreen\n\nAHAs do increase photosensitivity, so *please* wear a sunscreen during the day! **[I highly recommend making sure your sunscreen is stable.](http://www.skinacea.com/faq/sunscreen/s01-sunscreen-stability.html#.UbL1Dfk3u1s)**\n\nI also recommend only using an AHA 3x a week, if you are sensitive-skinned, though some can use it every night without issue. If you are new to AHAs, introduce them every third night and build up to every other night until you know your tolerance.\n\nMoving on...\n\n**BHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\"** BHAs are a bit more complicated than AHAs. They work by penetrating the pore and essentially \"degunking.\" This is what makes them preferred for oily and acne-prone skin, though *acne-prone skin can certainly benefit from an AHA!* \n\nFor the purpose of this post, the BHA we will be talking about is **salicylic acid**, which is derived from salicin. Because of this, it is not advised to use salicylic acid products if you have an asprin allergy. \n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and in fact usually causes drying of the skin, though it is usually more gentle than other common acne treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide. It is also oil soluble, so don't worry about your OCM messing with it's effectiveness!\n\nThe most commonly recommended BHA on this subreddit is Stridex \"in the red box\" since it is alcohol-free. However, if you cannot tolerate menthol, *I highly recommend Paula's Choice exfoliants.* I personally use the [CLEAR Regular Strength 2% BHA Liquid](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/CLEAR-Regular-Strength-Anti-Redness-Exfoliating-Solution-With-Two-Percent-Salicylic-Acid/) and it has not done wrong by my extremely sensitive skin. If you need a stronger BHA, check out [the 2% BHA Liquid](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Skin-Perfecting-Two-Percent-BHA-Liquid-Exfoliant/). It is not as gentle as the \"regular strength,\" despite also being 2%. This is likely due to the other ingredients that act as a delivery system for the product.\n\n**[Also, as far as we know, BHAs do NOT increase sun sensitivity.](http://tinyurl.com/md2pu6u)**\n\nYour routine will look identical to the routine above for AHAs when using BHAs: \n\n* Cleanse -> Pat dry -> Toners -> AHA -> Serums -> Moisturizers -> Any additional occlusives (ie. Vaseline) -> Sunscreen\n\nThis is because *most treatments work best when applied to clean, bare skin*. \n\nSame thing as AHAs -- If you are new to BHAs, start slow, and build until you find your tolerance. Some may find they can use BHAs twice a day.\n\n**So in summary:**\n\n* AHAs - Drier skin types. \"Unglues\" dead skin. Glycolic, lactic, mandelic. Humectant properties. Causes photo-sensitivity -- use only PM and wear a stable sunscreen AM. Repairs photoaged skin. \n* BHAs - Oilier skin types. \"Degunks\" pores. Salicylic acid. Can be drying. Does not cause photo-sensitivity. Can use AM or PM. \n* They CAN be used together, though I highly recommend adding them *one at a time* and finding your tolerance for each individual product before introducing another exfoliant. Sensitive-skinned folk should proceed with caution.\n\n---\n\nNotes: Apologies for this being a bit disorganized. Hopefully it all makes sense! I am a bit scatter-brained tonight and having difficulties writing. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have, and have a lovely weekend, SCA! :)",

    "body": "I'm normally an AB devotee, but we have some big news here in Western skincare. Not to sound too hyperbolic, but this is literally a game changer.   \n\n\"To see ingredients like retinoid, niacinamide, Vitamin C and Matrixyl being sold at well under ¬£10 each is a skincare revolution. While these ingredients may not be as ground-breaking as many brands make them out to be, they are highly effective and they do provide excellent results, they just don‚Äôt need to be sold at such a high price.\"    \nApparently this line just launched today, read more details here https://detailorientedbeauty.com/2016/08/30/major-beauty-psa-the-ordinary-from-deciem-has-launched-on-victoria-health/   \n\nThey have an anhydrous LAA serum for only $6?! And a niacinamide serum for $6 and a dupe of the Skinceuticals B5 gel for $7 and lactic acid serums and peptide serums and an arbutin serum and omg what? Hyperventilating (when I first saw these, I was legitimately confused how such low prices were possible... but I guess it's real! lol)   \n\nMany of the formulations are very bare bones indeed, more or less just water + star ingredient(s). But skinceuticals sells like 3 ingredients in its B5 gel for $90 so who's complaining? I'm really most impressed with the C serum. Anhydrous LAA serums are (too) uncommon in the current market, and this one is so darn cheap! [for those not familiar w/ LAA, it's the most potent/effective form of Vitamin C, but is also SUPER unstable in water-based formulations, so anhydrous formulas are always a great idea]   \nhttp://ordinaries.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml    \n\nPersonally I first pulled the trigger on the niacinamide + arbutin serums (PIH is out of control rn) and was delighted to find shipping was free as well (would've gladly paid a few bucks though!) I've never ordered from Deciem before so can anyone who has, confirm if this is normal? website is kinda confusing otherwise. Even when I had the single $6 niacinamide gel in my cart it said $0 for shipping.   \n\nGiven the low price point, I can't imagine they have a big advertising budget, so perhaps they are hoping for word of mouth to boost sales. In which case, I'm more than happy to let y'all know about this. Not affiliated, just excited   \n\nedit: sorry just noticed the title says \"new\" twice. I'm just that excited   \nedit 2: pls remember to do your due diligence with ingredients. don't get carried away by claims. I wanted a niacinamide product for a while so that's what I bought. cheap doesnt mean its good for your particular skintype!",

Will rebuy when I have money :)\n\nBut why I like Deciem is because they are similar to my other skincare brand - quality ingredients and no price gouging. Plus I was really wowed by Brandon's detailed replies and patience in answering queries at Caroline Hirons blog",
