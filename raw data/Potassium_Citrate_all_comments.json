    "body": "Hello, fellow guinea pigs and their owners! Unfortunately for me, I've been taking this preventative medicine called potassium citrate to help prevent stones. My owner started me off with the apple flavour, but to be honest I really don't like it. This time around my owner decided to try the banana flavour to see if I'd like it. Boy, that was a bad decision because it tastes even worse than the apple one! I'm wondering if there are any other piggies out there on this medicine that have a flavour they like that I should try next, or if I should tell my owner to go back to the apple flavour (lesser of the two evils). Unfortunately I've never had much of a sweet tooth, but the vet said the flavours they have are: Apple, Banana, Cherry, Grape and Strawberry. They also said they have some other flavours like Butterscotch, Caramel, Honey, Peanut Butter and Vanilla, but as a guinea pig I don't think they would appeal to me. Thank you for any suggestions!\n\nWheek wheek,\n\nNoni",

I get that this may be a scary topic.~~ edit: I was a jerk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Make sure you're administering the meds correctly.** This means you may need a refresher lesson from the vet team. Ask them to show you how to take the medicine. If she will do it for them, figure out what they're doing that you're not doing.\n2. **Ask what brand of oral syringe is used by the vet, ask if you can have some, and the name of the brand, or buy some from them.** Some animals may just dislike certain types of oral syringes for a plethora of reasons. Sometimes, the medication is not the issue -- it's the method of application. It's like how some people aren't allergic to a specific medication, but, to say, the cornstarch used to make the biodegradable lid on the medicine bottle. Equipment issues are a thing.\n3. **Try literally every flavor of the med.** It doesn't matter whether you assume the animal will not like vanilla or peanut butter. Maybe the animal loves strawberries as a treat but will hate strawberry meds. There is not always an association between what foods an animal will like and what med flavors an animal will tolerate. Not every med flavor is going to perfectly match what's on the label: for instance, grape flavor is often not the taste of 'regular' grapes, but of a specific type of grape. 'Vanilla' can often taste more like raspberry. Just see the flavors as Flavor A, Flavor B, Flavor C, etc.\n4. **Also ask about an unflavored option, or any acceptable mixers.** For instance, maybe it's okay to put it on a slice of banana. I don't know. I am not a vet professional. Potassium citrate is apparently salty/bitter/sour.\n5. **Log your results with feeding Noni a given medication flavor for a week or two in a row, or for however the vet recommends.** Figure out which med Noni hates the least. Log how difficult you think it was (with 1 being 'she went for it on her own and loved it,' 5 being 'eh it's medication,' and 10 being 'she refused to touch it.') and log how much you were able to administer, in MLs. Ask the vet what to log.\n\nIf it can be given with food, ask if it can be given *before* food, like first thing in the morning before Noni gets her vegetables. If it can be given *after* food, ask if it can be followed up with some other food, e.g. a blueberry, a plain boring Timothy biscuit without additives (to get the taste out of her mouth.)",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

Plus when I was starting out last year I never knew when to give oral or IV potassium, or what options were available in general so hopefully this can help with that. Comments/feedbacks/suggestions are welcome!! :)  \n  \n------------\n  \nShould we really be replacing potassium and magnesium all the time? Eh, the evidence isn't great but we usually do it anyways to avoid getting paged constantly. We should probably change that though. Here's some background:  \n​  \nCommon clinical practice suggests replacing K > 4 and Mg > 2, especially in patients at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.\n2000 Practice Guidelines = https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/485434  \n​  \nHowever, evidence for replacing to these goals is very poor.   \nBackground = [Potassium Repletion: Why So Common in Hospitalized Heart Failure Patients?](https://www.medpagetoday.com/resource-centers/focus-hyperkalemia/potassium-repletion-why-so-common-hospitalized-heart-failure-patients/2680)  \nJournal Article = [O'Sullivan et al \\(JAMA Dec 2019\\)   \n](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31339844/)​  \nEvidence shows that extremes (K < 3.5 or > 4.5) are associated with worse outcomes. Not just a random mildly low K of 3.6 or 3.8.  \nJournal Article = [Patel et al \\(Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovascular Care May 2017\\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5410890/)  \n​  \n#Potassium\nGive 10 mEq for every 0.1 you want the potassium to go up.  \nExample: K 3.6 and you want it to be 4.0 = give 40 mEq IV or PO potassium  \nExample: K 3.2 and you want it to be 4.0 = give 40 mEq IV potassium + 40 mEq PO potassium  \nIf patient is severely hypokalemic (K < 3.0), they will need more than 10 mEq per 0.1 increase.  \n​  \n* If patient has AKI or CKD, give LESS potassium to avoid hyperkalemia (probably 50% or less of what you would normally give)!  \n* Per /u/renegaderaptor, K is also absorbed very readily thru the gut, and PO K is much less expensive than IV K. So unless the pt is critically ill, or the labs are critically low, PO K > IV K in most cases. It’s also best to give in divided doses orally if you go over ~40 mEq (so PO 30 & 30 four hrs later would be good for a person with K 3.4). Also, the tab is sustained release (that’s what SR is), which means it won’t act rapidly and won’t be reflected in the labs for several (I think 12ish?) hours. If you’re going to be checking a K soon after, or want rapid (but not emergent) onset, do oral solution.  \n​  \n**Options:**  \n- KCl SR tablet = downside is it is a very large pill and can be hard for patients to swallow  \n- KCl oral liquid = tastes horrible, some patients prefer though  \n- KCl IV = burning is a very common side effect which is intolerable for some patients. You can try giving with lidocaine ([may not be best practice but some places do it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730072/)) or piggyback onto maintenance fluids to reduce this effect. Also each 10 mEq equals 50 mL which may be a lot of unwanted volume for patients.  \n- K-Lyte (potassium bicarb and potassium citrate) effervescent tablets = good option to try if patient can't tolerate the regular tablet, comes in 25 mEq and 50 mEq forms  \n​  \nPeripherally you can only give 10 mEq/hr by IV.   \nIf you have central access, you can give up to 20 mEq/hr by IV.  \n​  \n* One reason for refractory hypokalemia = low magnesium. Check their magnesium levels and replace it before giving potassium if this is the case!   \nMagnesium normally inhibits K+ secreting channels in the collecting duct, so if you don't have enough Mg you will start spilling potassium.  \n​  \nSide effects of hypokalemia = muscle weakness, paralysis, arrhythmias  \n​  \n#Magnesium\nEach 1 gm IV magnesium will raise serum level by 0.1.  \n400 gm PO magnesium (the standard dose) is [equivalent](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d1b951_5bf71f0890714bc9bc721dc9fb26ebaa~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_660,h_77,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/Screenshot_29.webp) to about 2 gm IV, though this doesn't account for differences in PO absorption.  \n​  \n**Options**  \n- MgSO4 IV = pretty much the go to method for magnesium replacement. Just consider how much fluid is in each dose.  \n- Magnesium oxide tablets = causes diarrhea frequently which is why it is not preferred. Give if needed though. Common doses you can try are 400 mg x 1, 400 mg daily for 2 days, 400 mg BID for 2 days, etc.  \n​  \nSide effects of hypomagnesemia = muscle cramps (Charley horse), numbness/tingling, arrhythmias, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia (induces resistance to PTH)  \n​  \n#Calcium  \nOften needs correction especially in ICU level patients, as this can affect their respiratory dynamics.  \nRemember to check if the patient is actually hypocalcemic or not by correcting for albumin.   \nCorrected Ca = (4 - albumin) * 0.8 + Ca  \nWe also sometimes check serum ionized Ca levels which bypasses the need for correction entirely  \n​  \n**Options**  \n- Calcium chloride IV = preferred in patients with cardiac arrest, higher concentration (3x more) than calcium gluconate. Generally only to be given in patients with CENTRAL ACCESS given the risk of tissue necrosis  \n- Calcium gluconate IV = preferred in non-cardiac arrest patients, lower risk of tissue necrosis if fluid extravasates. In general, most studies show calcium gluconate raises serum calcium the same as calcium chloride but with lower risk, just a few studies in critically ill patients showed that calcium chloride was a little faster. Typical dose = 1-2 gm. This should probably be your go to.  \n- Calcium carbonate (Tums) PO = 500mg to 4g/day in 1-3 divided doses  \n- Calcium citrate PO = 200mg to 1g/day in single or divided doses  \n​  \nNice algorithm for treatment on UpToDate = [link](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=ENDO%2F115835&topicKey=ENDO%2F826&source=see_link)  \nBasically, if calcium <7.5 or ionized <0.8, give IV. Otherwise try PO if patient can tolerate.  \n  \n\n*One reason for refractory hypocalcemia = low magnesium. Check magnesium levels and replace!  \n​  \nSide effects of hypocalcemia = perioral numbness (first sign), Trousseau's sign (involuntary hand/arm contraction with checking BP), Chvostek's sign (facial twitching with light touch), bronchospasm, muscle numbness/spasms/tingling, seizures, altered mental status, arrhythmias (prolonged QT common)  \n​  \n#Phosphate  \n  \nLol I don't actually really know how to replace phosphorus that well . . . don't really have to do it that much. For this one, we use mmol instead of mEq to calculate how much to give.  \n​  \nNormal range at UC Davis = 2.4-5.0 mg/dL  \n​  \n**Options**  \n- Potassium + sodium phosphate (K-Phos) tablet PO = use if just mild hypophosphatemia ( > 2.0), side effect is diarrhea if you use too much so if you need high doses just give IV. Just give 1-2 tablets PO TID with meals for a day or two idk.\n- Sodium phosphate IV = probably use this one more than IV potassium phosphate because there's no potassium  \n- Potassium phosphate IV = 21 mEq potassium per 15 mmol phosphate  \n​  \nUpToDate says to weight base dose all this stuff but it seems a little too complicated. I saw this tip on Reddit:  \n​  \n< 2.0 = 15 mmol sodium phos IV over 4 hours  \n< 1.5 = 30 mmol sodium phos IV over 6 hours  \n< 1.0 = 45 mmol sodium phos IV over 8 hours  \n   \nSide effects of hypophosphatemia = basically all the same stuff as above, muscle weakness and cramps, bone pain\n\n——————\n\nLink to video where I discuss the above post in a little more detail: https://youtu.be/-xX1Sn8vOyA",

    "body": "Link to paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-00411-4\n\nTitle should read: “Ultra-processed ketogenic diets inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis and induce cardiac fibrosis in sedentary rats who consumed the diet for 10% of their lifespans”\n\nFirst of all, rodents did not evolve under conditions that required them to consume high fat ketogenic diets. For this reason, it seems obvious that long-term feeding of a species-inappropriate diet will cause health issues. \n\nHumans evolved eating organs, meat, and fat and fasting for extended periods during times of food scarcity. We likely would have been in a state of ketosis almost all the time. Given that our ancestors would have had high levels of activity, they also would have remained in ketosis even if tubers, berries, and/or honey were consumed (in today’s terms: professional cyclists on a ketogenic diet can consume 200g of carbs or more per day and still be in ketosis due to their high levels of activity). \n\nNext, let’s look at the ketogenic diet formulation used in this study:\n\n*the KD contained approximately 16.5% casein, 0.25% L-cystine, 8.2% cellulose, 4.25% soybean oil, 62.7% cocoa butter, 1.6% mineral mix, 2.1% dicalcium phosphate, 0.9% calcium carbonate, 2.7% potassium citrate, 0.16% vitamin mix, 0.32% choline bitartrate and 0.32% DL-methionine (percentages are mass%).*\n\nThese standardized rodent chows are acceptable (not ideal) for studying short term effects of keto diet, but it is simply erroneous to study animals on these chows in the long-term. This is essentially the equivalent of a human eating a heavily processed keto meal replacement (think keto-soylent) all day every day for 10% of their lifetime, or \\~8 years (this study fed rats for 4 months and lab rats live on average 3.5 years, which equates to \\~10% of their total lifespan). Not to mention these rats are totally sedentary. When humans eat a ketogenic diet, we aren’t eating some fat and protein isolate fortified with synthetic forms of essential nutrients. Our foods are complex matrices of vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and more in specific ratios that provide our bodies with the information needed for their proper assimilation and integration. \n\nI also cannot understand how their rats had 3HB concentrations of 4.5mM while eating their ketogenic chow. I worked with mice on ketogenic diet and their serum levels would reach \\~2mM max. In humans on keto diet, 1mM is average. Concentrations between 3-5mM are consistent with long-term fasting/starvation.. For example, in George Cahill’s starvation studies in the 60s, circulating 3HB levels didn’t reach to 4mM until after 10 days of starvation in obese individuals. \n\nIf the authors really wanted to know if ketogenic diets truly pose a long-term risk in humans, they should have focused their research on individuals with intractable epilepsy many of whom have been on ketogenic diets for some version of their whole lives. Do these individuals have increased rates of cardiac fibrosis relative to epileptics who are not on ketogenic diets? I have never seen clinical data suggesting this, but this is where I would look if I were doing the study. \n\nRegarding their clinical data references, they do not appear to have adjusted their data for incidence of insulin resistance/pre-diabetes/diabetes, nor did they even report the demographics of the patients in the study. “Diabesity” is a huge risk factor for atrial fibrillation, and pre-diabetes/diabetes causes increases in circulating ketone body levels in a totally different context than ketogenic diet. In ketogenic diet, the body is burning fat and ketones because there is very little carbohydrate available (normal physiologic situation), in diabetes the body is burning fat and ketones because it cannot properly burn carbohydrates (pathologic situation with broad consequences across the tissues of the body). This is all to say that it is misleading to present this data without sharing additional clinical data on the patients, and it is highly likely that most of the patients in the study were metabolically unhealthy, which is a MAJOR confounding factor when analyzing these data.  \n\nFinally, I feel that it is extremely disingenuous of the authors to claim that a long-term ketogenic diet is harmful, when the alternative diet for the average person is the Standard American diet. Perhaps they should’ve put their control rats on a standard American chow, then we will see the truth. \n\nTLDR: The experimental conditions used in this paper do not accurately represent the context in which humans would consume ketogenic diets. To say ketogenic diet is harmful without comparing it to the alternative (standard American diet) is disingenuous. Patient data likely confounded by metabolic dysfunction.",

    "body": "Thanks for taking the time to read this first! :)  None of us are doctors, and the advice here is based on our own experiences. If you are suffering, or think you might have a stone, or are trying to help somebody with symptoms, please *start here*.  These are the questions we seem to hear a lot on this subreddit.  If you have a question that isn't covered here, by all means please post in the subreddit.  We have lots of stone formers who have a wide range of experiences in this area and we may be able to at least point you in the right direction.  Good luck, drink lots of water and may pain be a stranger to you!\n\n**I suspect I have a stone. Should I see a doctor?  When should I go to the ER?**\n\nGo to the emergency room if you have a fever or are vomiting, or your pain is unbearable, or if you stop urinating (this may mean you have a blockage).\n\nIf you’re experiencing pain that you think is a kidney stone, visit your doctor and/or urologist.  Most doctors are very good at assessing you and your family history as well as factors such as age, weight, sex, prior medical history and current symptoms.  Doctors are much better at providing an intelligent diagnosis (which is really an educated guess) than we are on reddit.\n\nCheck to make sure what you think is a stone is actually a stone.  The cause of abdominal pain is sometimes difficult to pin down exactly.  Pain in your abdomen/ mid-section could be any one of a number of things, including digestive issues, kidney stones, appendicitis, colitis, and diverticulitis to name a few. Remember that kidney stones classically present with flank pain.  \n\nThe symptoms of a kidney stone are usually one or more of the following:\n\n* Pain on the right or left flank (mid-way between your side and your spine, on your back), sometimes radiating down to the groin (testicles for males, pelvis/ovarian area for females).  *  The pain is specifically UNDER the rib cage (actually under the diaphragm)\n* Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity\n* Pain on urination or urethra spasms\n* Pink, red or brown urine\n* Cloudy or foul-smelling urine\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Persistent need to urinate\n* Urinating more often than usual\n* Fever and chills if an infection is present\n* Urinating small amounts\n\nPain caused by a kidney stone may change — for instance, shifting to a different location or increasing in intensity — as the stone moves through your urinary tract.  [Source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755)\n\n**I know I have a stone. What do I do? What should I expect?**\n\nIF YOU HAVE A FEVER OR ARE VOMITING OR ARE UNABLE TO URINATE, PROCEED TO THE ER. \n\nPain will come and go, and will likely vary from one person to the next.  So while you may read in this sub-reddit about severe pain, that's not *necessarily* what *you* will experience.  So the first thing to do is try to relax and not get worked up about what MIGHT happen.  If it does happen, the pain comes in two forms:  1) waves (spasms) of pain, which can feel like a very strong cramp, and 2) a general achy feeling between your kidney area, and down to your groin.  As mentioned above, the \"classic\" kidney stone pain is from the flank down to the groin.\n\n**Drink lots of water.**  Water will increase the amount of urine you produce, and will also plump up your urinary system in general, which will make for less contact between any stones you have and the walls of your ureter.  When stones rub against the walls of your ureter, you experience pain.  Another benefit from drinking water is that the concentration of waste produce in your urine is more diluted, which means that the crystals which make up kidney stones are less likely to find a date, and will head out on their own.  Yet another benefit to proper hydration is that dilute urine is less likely to irritate any abrasions that previous stones may have made in your urinary tract.  Less irritation = less chance of an infection.  How much water?  You want to be producing about 2 1/2 liters of urine per day, so drink a bit more than that.  Read more about water [here](https://kidneystones.uchicago.edu/how-to-drink-enough-water/)\n\nLocate some pain management methods that work for you, and that are readily available.  Over the counter (OTC) medicines like aspirin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen (tylenol) can help, but only take as much as you need for as long as you need.  A daily habit of NSAIDs like ibuprofen can lead to serious issues.  Prescription pain medicines can also help, but you need to locate a doctor who will prescribe you what you need.  Azo (Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride) is used by many in this subreddit.  Cannabis, if it's legal where you live, can also provide some relief.  Heat - in the form of heating pads, hot baths or showers, can help when you're experiencing a wave of pain.  Find what works for *you* - don't just blindly follow the advice of others.\n\nSome people experience nausea, which can occur with or without accompanying pain. Be prepared (have a bucket or bag available if you're feeling a wave of nausea come along, although sometimes there's not much warning).\n\nIf you're in the middle of a pain session, and feel like you need to visit the Emergency Room/ Urgent Care clinic, think about how you'll get there.  Some folks experience such strong pain, that they're not able to drive themselves.  Find a driver who you can rely on to get you to the care you need on short notice.\n\n**How long do stones take to pass?**\n\nSome stones never pass (they stay in the kidney) and are removed via surgery (lithotripsy or uretoscope).\n\nStones that are “smaller” - usually 5mm or less - will pass without surgery being required, although there will be some pain/ discomfort.  Some folks have passed larger stones, but this isn’t common.  I’ve passed a 7 - 8 mm stone without surgery.\n\n**What kinds of stones are there?**\n\n* **Calcium stones** Most kidney stones are calcium stones, usually in the form of calcium oxalate. Oxalate is a naturally occurring substance found in food and is also made daily by your liver. Some fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and chocolate, have high oxalate content. There is conflicting research on whether or not a diet high in oxalates can contribute to stones.\n\n     Dietary factors, high doses of vitamin D, intestinal bypass surgery and several metabolic disorders can increase the concentration of calcium or oxalate in urine. If you’re taking a Vitamin D supplement, it may be worth talking to your health care provider to explore whether there may be a relationship between your current dose and your stones.  [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872784/)\n\n* Calcium stones may also occur in the form of **calcium phosphate**. This type of stone is more common in metabolic conditions, such as renal tubular acidosis. It may also be associated with certain migraine headaches or with taking certain seizure medications, such as topiramate (Topamax). This type of stone is also common in those with autoimmune diseases due to Renal Tubular Acidosis. Those who make these stones tend to make many, and make them frequently. Difficult to treat.\n\n* **Struvite** stones. Struvite stones form in response to an infection, such as a urinary tract infection. These stones can grow quickly and become quite large, sometimes with few symptoms or little warning.\n\n* **Uric acid** stones. Uric acid stones can form in people who don't drink enough fluids or who lose too much fluid, those who eat a high-protein diet, and those who have gout. Certain genetic factors also may increase your risk of uric acid stones.\n\n* **Cystine** stones. These stones form in people with a hereditary disorder that causes the kidneys to excrete too much of certain amino acids (cystinuria).\n\n**How do I know what kind of stones I make?**\n\nYour urologist can send the stones to the lab to be analyzed. Ask for a strainer to strain your urine if you wish to collect a stone. Not all urologists dispense them readily.\n\n**What can I do to prevent more stones?**\n\nIn general, drink more water, limit your salt and sugar intake and get your weight within recommended ranges. (See U Chicago Kidney Stone diet for more details here.)\n\nFor specific types of stones, there are specific dietary recommendations, but you’d need to have your stones analyzed (first), and then your urine tested (using one or more 24-hour urine samples).  DIFFERENT STONES HAVE DIFFERENT DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n* [U Chicago site](https://kidneystones.uchicago.edu/the-kidney-stone-diet/)\n* [NCBI site](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4265710/#B6)\n\nKeep in mind that there is no one ‘magic bullet’ for kidney stone treatment.\n\n**What kind of treatments are there for stones?**\n\n* Most common method (because it's the least invasive) is to advise the patient to stay hydrated, take OTC pain killers as required and stay active. This approach usually results in the stone passing.\n* [Medical Expulsive Therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29620795) - in addition to fluids and pain killers, sometimes Tamsulosin (Flomax) is prescribed to aid in stone passage.  Studies suggest this is most effective for smaller (< 5mm) stones; less so for larger stones.\n* [Ureteroscopy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16213-ureteroscopy) with either physical removal or laser break-up\n* [Lithotripsy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16582-shockwave-lithotripsy) shockwave lithotripsy (sometimes abbreviated as ESWL) uses external shockwaves to break a stone into smaller parts. Only one stone can be blasted at a time. Side effects from this include urinating blood and flank pain.\n* [Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17349-percutaneous-nephrolithotomy) - rarely used/ only when other methods are not successful.  A small incision is made in the back, and a tube inserted into the kidney to remove stones.\n\n**What resources are there for kidney stone formers?**\n\n* [University of Chicago](https://kidneystones.uchicago.edu/patients/)\n* [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15604-kidney-stones-)\n* [Harvard Medical](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/kidney-stones-common-painful-preventable)\n* [National Kidney Foundation](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/atozTopic_KidneyStones)\n* [Wikipedia article on Kidney Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone_disease)\n\n**Does lemonade help stones?**\n\nIf you form CALCIUM OXALATE stones, there is some [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2637791/) that the citric acid in lemon juice (or lime juice) can help add to the total volume of urine, reducing its saturation of calcium and other crystals, and may enhance urinary citrate excretion.\n\n**What are the methods for diagnosing a stone?**\n\n* Computed Tomography (CT) - most radiation, most resolution/ accuracy, $$$\n* KUB X-ray (KUB = Kidney Ureter Bladder) - medium radiation, moderate resolution, $$\n* Ultrasound - no radiation, reasonable resolution, $\n\nFor more information on the pro's and con's of different imaging techniques, please click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5443345/)\n\n**Which medications are available for kidney stone treatment?**\n\n* Narcotic painkillers (ex: morphine)\n* Non-narcotic painkillers (ex: Toradol, cannabis) \n* Anti-nausea medications (ex: Zofran)\n* Urocit-K (ex: Potassium Citrate)\n* Flomax (Tamsulosin)\n\nTreatment is usually symptom based, except for some medications which aim to alter the pH of the urine like Urocit-K.\n\nEnding thoughts: Thank you for taking the time to read our FAQ. Remember, everyone’s stone history is different, and every urologist is different. What works for you may not work for others. In general, staying hydrated (2-4L per day) is your best defense and will help keep your kidneys functioning happily. If you are not happy with your urologist, seek the help of a nephrologist.\n\nEdits: spelling, words, and added a section on \"what do I do now\".  Added wikipedia reference.",

I work 8-10 hours a day sitting in a chair for the last 8 years. It fucked me over.\n\nAnyway, here are a few things to check and fix, that are know to cause pelvis stability issues.\n\n* anterior pelvic tilt\n* posterior pelvic tilt\n* hip mobility\n   * excessive external rotation ( duck feet )\n   * excessive internal rotation ( not so common )\n* core stability\n   * check out any Yt video for \"The mcGill Big 3\" and do those 3 exercises morning and night for the rest of your life\n   * this is stability, not core strength, and should be done first before strength\n* core strength\n   * transversus abdominis should be your main focuse\n   * external + internal obliques also very important\n   * 1-2 times a way for the rectus abs, not so important\n* glute strength\n   * with the emphasis of also working out gluteus medius and minimus which are very important\n   * should be worked out minimum of 5 days a week, always AFTER core/abs\n* ankle mobility\n\nA few non muscle related stuff that helps in the chronic periods when you are starting:\n\n* higher potassium intake\n   * half a teaspoon of potassium citrate power and after 30 minutes all your muscles will be relaxed. develop a habit of eating rich potassium foods and don't relly on powder and it's a bit risky. too much and your hear will work slower\n* decaf or better nocaf at least until you get a grip on your condition\n   * cortisol will make progress much much slower\n* learn to do proper diaphragmatic breathing\n   * no, inflating your belly won't help and it's actually making things worse as you are stretching the front of your perineum and it's creating a reflex to always contract PC muscle on inhale\n   * you need to learn how to do full 360 breathing, where your ribs expand\n   * 30 mins/day in the beginning will help to keep your PF relaxed until you fix your muscular imbalance\n* stretch and strengthen the QL muscle. research what this muscle is, why it gets tight, and work it out\n\nLast, but not least, and probably overlooked:\n\n* have more sex. no matter how strong you are in your pelvic floor, if your penis has no clue how a vagina feels like, or if it feels it once every 3 months, you are not going to see any improvements\n* at the very least, don't ever masturbate dry, always rub the glans inside a first, better with an overhand grip, and ALWAYS stimulate the corona of the glans. There is a spot on the right side of the corona which is called an ejaculatory reflex. you need to get your penis accustomed\n* if you can, buy a fleshlight\n* no matter what people say, porn is NOT helping, at all. In terms of cortisol, and anxiety, it makes things worse\n\nMy personal advice to you, at least for the 30+ guys here, go see a PT for 1-2 sessions and get an assesment of what's wrong with you. Check posture, muscle imbalance, ask to get on that tredmill where they put sensors on you and see what muscles arent firing and which are over working.\n\nIt's going to be the best $200 - $300 you've ever spent.\n\nThey will tell you exactly what the problem is, and then you can work it out on your own.\n\nIt's either spending some money or spending tome months figuring it out on your own\n\nSmall tip:\n\n* when having sex standing, forcefully internally rotate your hips, engage your TVA and do a proper 360 breathing inhale, then on the exhale keep that tension pushing in your pelvic floor. It is going to help you last A LITTLE longer. Or much longer, depending on how severe you are. \n\nThe conclusion is that your main issue is pelvis stability.\n\nThe moment the pelvis isn't in the position it hopes to be, it will engage the pelvic muscles as a response to protect the organs.\n\nNot even a million reverse kegels are going to fight that defense mechanism built inside you.\n\nKeep the pelvis stable, and the pelvic floor won't contract.\n\nDon't lose time on the small stuff, like the BC and IC muscle. leave them alone, they are doing what they think it's right. Orgasm is rushed by the PC muscle, which is part of the levator ani muscle group, and that group contracts on its own.\n\nMost of you don't even know those muscles can relax, and probably have spend years in a contracted state.\n\nI've seen a video where a guy said having sex back to back for 30 mins - 1 hour helps.\n\nYep, it does.\n\nIf it is possible in your curent situation, a 3 hour session with a hot prostitute might actually provide a lot of temporary fix until you fix your muscles\n\nHowever I won't go into this as I know it's rarely possible due to marriage, girlfriend, etc.\n\nIf your partner is understanding, explain to them their issue and that having one 2 hour session a week will help things a lot. \n\nRemember that spending time on reddit will NOT fix your issue.\n\nDon't fixate on pudendal neuralgia. That is a sympton of a trapped nerved due to tight muscles, specifically the piriforms and levator ani. It will go away once you restore balance. No other way around it.\n\nOk, good luck guys.\n\nHope this helps at least somebody.",

    "body": "Spent about 1-1/2 years getting electrolytes sorted out (because I was afraid of all the posts on the internet about potassium being dangerous, so I had to gradually experiment for myself with sodium, potassium, and magnesium). Finally figured out for me there was no need to binge on sodium. Just my normal sodium intake was fine. Instead I found that increasing my magnesium intake from 200 mg magnesium citrate twice a day to three times a day, and taking about 3 grams of potassium citrate over the course of the day got rid of a lot of the dizziness and nausea I had been experiencing. (Adding carbs did not make it go away). I have a water bottle and put 1/4 teaspoon potassium citrate in it each time I fill it (about twice a day or more). Also add creatine to each bottle because it seems to help my muscles stay stronger.\n\nSecond major discovery: I probably have not been getting enough protein.  I was scared by the warnings that too much protein can inhibit weight loss.  I'm beginning to think that seniors and/or senior women, at least some of us, may need a lot more protein that I previously thought or than most \"experts\" advise. So I stopped trying to micromanage my protein intake and just started eating chicken or a protein bar when I started to feel the need. This discovery has enabled me to start building up my endurance again.\n\nFrom the beginning I've never felt I needed to lose more than about 10-15 pounds.  Husband says I look a little thinner to him. I'm not sure, but my major goal in my 70's is to feel good, to have energy, and to be healthy.  If I can get rid of a few pounds of belly fat and/or liver fat, that will be good too.  Still think it might happen when my body realizes I'm staying the course.\n\nThanks for reading. Hope this will possibly encourage some other senior women who may be trying to figure it all out.\n",

        "body": "54F, thanks for posting! I started Jan. 2, with a weight loss goal of 22 lbs. Am within 5 lbs of goal. I found that lazy keto wasn't cutting it. Had some habits from Atkins way back when that i thought were low carb but weren't low enough. Weigh and measure. I have never figured out the electrolyte thing, but haven't had much trouble. Found that Lite Salt helps my foot cramps as much as a banana ever did. And I loathe bananas. Your post was enlightening in that regard. I also feel great and can have a protein smoothie at 8 and not think of food again until 3. That's huge for me and makes the WOE worth it. Best to you!",

Even though I am slightly active and try to always be moving, I chose ‘Sedentary’. Didn’t want to lie to myself.\nCool. So if I cut 500cals, that would guarantee 1lb loss/week. I went with 800-1000\n\nMyfitnesspal- Many options out there, but I had used in the past, and was comfortable with the interface.\nPlopped in my goals, macros being about 65%fat, the rest for protein.\nAT LEAST MY GOAL WEIGHT IN PROTEIN. 150g everyday. Minimum.\nSome days it was only 130g, but rarely. Big goal, protein.\nCarbs I wanted to cut hardcore (since I was eating fast food and a pint of ice cream a night), so I made a goal of 10 NET. \n\nI stayed between 8-13g NET RELIGIOUSLY.\nWith my morning cup of coffee, I would input my food for the day to see what I would be at. If I was under/over, I would readjust, ALWAYS hitting my macros and NEVER GOING OVER MY CALORIE LIMIT.\n\nThat was key, as there is only 1 way to lose weight: EAT LESS THAN YOU BURN.\nNot the other way around. That was my mantra, because if I ate more, I could lie to myself and say ‘ Oh, well I’ll just do extra cardio’. \nNope. Couldn’t trust myself.\n\nFOOD SCALE: This has been the biggest key to my 100lb loss. I WEIGH EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO MY MOUTH.\nEVERYTHING. If the macros look off, I give myself a buffer, always erring on the higher side, since US nutritional labels can be misleading.\n\nELECTROLYTES!!!!- Day 1. Read the FAQ here and bought Nu-Salt, Potassium Citrate, Salt.\n6500mg Potassium, 600 Magnesium, 1000mg Sodium daily. Mixed in a water bottle with Mio, and drank throughout the day.\n5 bottles in my fridge that I bring everywhere.\nSure, the Citrate makes me GO, but aim used to it now.\n\nAfter a few months and 40lbs lost, I made a new goal each month, with the first being CUT OUT ALL KETO-LABELED FOODS by educating myself on hidden and weird products/hidden sugars, and the Glycemic Index of sugars, especially the artificial ones.\nMaltodextrin, any type of modified starch,\nMaltitol, etc.\nI stick with monkfruit and erithritol. But in moderation.\n\nWorking out?\nI didn’t start until 70lbs lost, and then I dialed it back because it was making me retain water. I’ll get near my goal and up my game.\n\nCHEAT DAYS: None. Why cheat? I wanted to lose weight and change my diet. I miss ice cream and pizza, but going from 3xl to a loose large AND 46in jeans to 35in??? Awesome.\nIt was about changing my mindset.\nI eat a tasty fat bomb of cream cheese/cocoa/coconut oil/nuts EVERY NIGHT, and that hits my sweet tooth.\n\nAnd the biggest contributor?:\nINTERMITTENT FASTING and OMAD.\nI’ve been doing 16:8 since Day One. \nLife is life, and sometimes it would go over, but I ALWAYS fast for at least 4 hours BEFORE sleep, and AFTER waking.\nHormones, cortisol, digestion and stuff.\nMost of the time I eat the majority of calories with dinner, as I love food.\n1lb beef/chicken, and 12-16oz of broccoli are my go-to.\n\nThese are my tips and tricks that have netted AWESOME results. Everyone is different, but the main key to lose weight is BE IN A CALORIC DEFICIT!\nKeto is just a tool to help stay full.\n\nSo. There’s that.\nIf I can do it, anyone can. Just make a plan, don’t lie to yourself, TRACK/WEIGH EVERY PIECE OF FOOD THAT GOES INTO YOUR MOUTH. Just because you didn’t track it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. :)\n\nLove\n\n ",

    "body": "Today marks the 100^th day of my water fast, here's an update of how things are going.\n\nFirst the basics:\n\n* **Type:** Water + salt, Potassium citrate, Magnesium citrate, and a weekly multivitamin. I drink Green tea and an occasional coffee.\n* **Length:** Day 100 / up to 135\n* **Why?:** Weight loss, autophagy\n* **Starting weight:** 424 lbs\n* **Weight this morning:** 344 lbs\n* **Total lost:** 79 lbs\n* **Blood pressure:** 101/74 \n\n**Notes:**\n\nLast few weeks have been getting tougher, felt awful yesterday and finally broke down and made some beef broth with a couple of bouillon cubes. It was glorious and definitely made me feel better, ended up having 3 cups before the night was over. Weight loss has completely stalled for the last 10 days and I am retaining quite a bit of water, I have significant edema in my thighs. Doc suggests drinking more water and getting more exercise, hopefully things will improve soon otherwise I will need to stop. My blood pressure has been going down but still in OK range, we are monitoring it carefully to make sure it doesn't get too low.\n\nI've told no family or friends what I'm doing. Managed to stay with family for a week and not reveal anything, when questioned I said I was doing a \"kind of protein shake fast\" and was vague about it. This allowed me to sit through family meals just drinking water without too much trouble.\n\nStill no actual hunger and never really have had any, first few months were very easy but as time has gone on really starting to look forward to completing the fast. Have decided to push on to a max of 135 days but may end at any time depending on how things are physically.\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* Weight loss, very visible from chest up, have a jaw line I haven't seen in decades\n* Having to redo wardrobe, getting rid of my largest sizes is very satisfying\n* Mental focus continues to be great\n* Tolerance of hot weather, hardly had to use my AC at all in July + August\n* Never think about eating or spend time/money planning or preparing meals\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n* Difficulty getting enough quality sleep is most definitely my biggest problem. Melatonin helps but contributes to water retention so try not to take it.\n* Nasty white tongue / mouth fungus taste, I am now spitting often. Listerine and brushing helps but doesn't completely solve it.\n* Uncomfortable to sit for long periods due to fat loss in my ass (seriously), just don't have the cushioning anymore.\n* Loss of muscle strength, I have stopped lifting and can definitely tell my leg and upper body fitness has gone down.\n* Cold all the time and have to keep heat turned up and wear sweat shirt.\n* Loss of some coordination, find it easy to trip on small things, nearly fell trying to get into my car today.\n* Have to make a conscious effort not to exert myself too hard or I will have a dizzy spell.\n* Have a constant albeit slight sensation that I am smelling smoke when there is none, this has persisted for months.\n\n**The Ugly:** *(Warning- TMI bathroom stuff ahead)*\n\n* Urine smell is absolutely terrible, I'd like to think I'm getting rid of toxins but don't know if that's why it's so bad.\n* Volume of bowel movements is surprising, they don't occur often but considering I am not eating it's really hard to comprehend what I am expelling.\n* Have gas once or twice per day for no explicable reason. Those of you who know the rules of Keto understand why this can be a problem, particularly when in public.\n* Loose skin, always knew that I would require surgery to remove my excess skin from decades of being obese but the full extent of it is really coming into focus.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you might have so fire away. *--Wilson*\n\n***************************************************\n\n**Edit:** A lot of comments below praising the length of my fast and wanted to add something I forgot to mention above. My hunger or lack thereof has really been the easiest part of doing this. I think my success has had very little if anything to do with any kind of will power. I really have no hunger, I mean none. I do periodically spend time diving down rabbit holes browsing food porn type subreddits and websites viewing recipes I would like to try \"once I get thin\" but they only trigger a psychological need to eat, not a physical one.\n\nYou know what hunger feels like, it's an actual physical feeling which I believes comes from an insulin response (Dr. Fung discusses this in his writings and videos). Others that have done really long fasts experience the same thing, you have a psychological need to eat but little to no physical one. Put another way, in my mind I know I *should* be eating but I just don't have the *drive* to do it.\n\nThe other thing I wanted to add was that I'm certain the ease at which I got into this has everything to do with the diet I was following before I started. I was already fat adapted because I had been following /r/zerocarb eating [OMAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/) for many months and prior to that I was /r/keto. My body and liver were already very well used to burning fat for fuel so switching over to fasting wasn't a really big change metabolically speaking. So I know when you say you struggle to do even a few days of fasting it's not simply a will power thing. Your body really is *physically* working hard to push you to eat by messing with your insulin and thus your blood sugar levels. Point being, don't beat yourself up for having a hard time doing a longer fast. If you want more success at longer fasts think about switching over to at least a Keto type diet for a few weeks prior to fasting to get your body used to burning fat for fuel as opposed to carbs.\n\n\n*********************************************\n*A word of caution for those of you think you can replicate my extremely long fast, I was over 420 pounds when I started this. Be smart and don't try anything like it without medical supervision.*\n",

    "body": "After a lot of reflection on how things were going I decided to break my water fast last night making it a total of 101 days. They say your body will tell you when you need to end it and to be honest I had that feeling. Just wasn't feeling right and I was fighting the law of diminishing returns on the benefits I was getting out of it. That plus the edema in my thighs was really concerning me so I felt it was much better to finish on a decent note. In case you missed it you can read about my insane fast in my [previous post here](https://redd.it/734wtn).\n\nI have since solved the edema issue, it was because I had cut way back on the amount of Potassium Citrate I was taking a few weeks ago. I have been taking potassium citrate for years to control my gout, it lowers the amount of Uric Acid in your blood which is the cause of my type of gout. It is also a strong diuretic. So when my gout symptoms completely disappeared during this fast I naturally cut back on the potassium, a lot. The fasting plus the lack of a diuretic meant I was retaining fluid and thus the cause of the edema in my legs. Took a bunch of Potassium and am now peeing like a race horse as they say.  \n\n**7 Day Refeeding plan**\n\nI broke the fast with 2 cups of chicken bone broth and 6 ounces of roasted chicken, no carbs or sugar. I will be following the [NICE Guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) as I am at high risk for refeeding syndrome. I am high risk due to the long fast and my very high body mass index. The NICE guidelines recommend that refeeding is started at no more than 50% of energy requirements in patients who have eaten little or nothing for more than 5 days. Basically start very slow and take supplements.\n\n* Calories will be kept under 500/day initially, no carbohydrates or sugars (this is more my decision as I am normally zerocarb)\n* Consume Bone broth several times a day (originally planned to start this a week before ending the fast)\n* Supplements will include a very good multi-vitamin, potassium, magnesium, and calcium\n\nWe will monitor how things go over the next 4 to 7 days and gradually increase daily calories assuming everything goes well. Plan to go in for a blood test next week.\n\nShould point out this wasn't a contest and I wasn't trying to see how far I could push myself, just doing the fast for the health benefits and stopped when it looked like I might be doing more harm than good. I also had medical supervision. I doubt I will ever do a fast of this length again but but it was an interesting experiment.\n\nShout out and special thanks to u/YamahaRN and u/JorgePasada who answered a lot of questions for me during the past few months and to all of the rest of you who offered your support and encouragement along the way of my completely insane fast, really appreciated it.\n\n\n",

    "body": "Good Day,\n\nRecently there have been a few posts regarding personal puer storage. As I’ve finished my cabinet style humidor not too long ago I thought I would share some pictures as well as notes on the process with you. \n\nBasically it consists of a French polished ebonized oak cabinet measuring 1.82 x 0.82 x 0.32 cm internal, inlayed doors with silicon stripping and double ball bearing catches, 2 humidity and temperature sensors, 2 air recirculation fans and a 2-way- humidity control unit. \n\nThe humidity control unit consists of 2 seperated chambers, one filled with stockosorb and water, the other one with potassium citrate. The stockosorb chamber serves as a constant source of humidity, whenever humidity is below the target humidity a fan integreated in the lid is slowly started reaching its maximum speed at more than 3 %, blowing air onto the moist stockosorb and pushing the moist air out on the backside behind the tea. Whenever humidity is more than 3% above target humidity a fan on the other compartment is started. It works the same way but potassium citrate in saturated solution will only bind moisture in RH of 62% and above. The humidity control was programmed by a friend, but there are many electrical system available for cigar storage. \n\nAn e-paper display constantly shows humidity and temperature measurements of both sensors, as well as an average and min / max over a time period that can be adjusted by turning knobs. Target humidity can be chosen freely, I’ve set it to 66% RH right now. The speed of the air circulation fans can also be adjusted freely, I’ve set them to 20 % (roughly 20 cubicmetres per hour). \n\nInitially I was not planning on adding the weather stripping to the doors or the catches, but I was not able to achieve humidity of higher than 60% without the additional sealing on the doors. Even right now it took more than 2 days to reach target humidity which is why I’ve changed the fans of the humidity control unit to more powerful ones that are designed for constant operation this week. After opening the humidor for around a minute the RH drops around 3%, but quickly reaches the same level it was at prior to opening. Perhaps opening the doors alone is not enough to allow for significant air exchange, or the tea and wood of the humidor itself have absorbed enough moisture already to quickly reestablish target humidity conditions. \n\nThe tea itself is stored in baskets made of Yew wood and ebonized oak attached to heavy duty pullouts. I might exchange them to standard or perhaps even tip on pullouts as they take a lot of force to operate and are frankly way overkill. The ones installed now are meant for weight up to 70kg not for 10-15kg tea. There’s also a shelf with slits to allow for air circulation where I put bricks / Tuos / Jincha and smaller cakes. \n\nAll exposed wood on the outside was ebonized, oiled and French polished – which was probably the most time consuming part of the process as I’ve easily spent more than 100 hours to achieve the desired finish. It’s crystal clear and basically a black mirror, though that was not the best choice in hindsight as every fingerprint is annoying me already due to the black wood. Another negative point is the inside of the cabinet still having a very light linseed oil smell. I’ve aired the cabinet out for close to a year now and I doubt it will have a negative impact on the tea but obviously I would prefer it not to have any smell at all.  \n\nRight now the cabinet is filled with roughly 40 kg of Puer, as well as 2 baskets of Heicha and a single Fu Brick I’ve thrown in there for tests sake. It has held a steady RH of 66 +/- 0.5 % and I have not had to add additional water to the stockosorb since adding the stripping to the doors. \n\nAnother advantage of the improved isolation is that the fans can only be heared when running on max speeds right now. Most of the time it does not produce any noise detectably by me.\nEven when running all year at max Speed the electrical bill would only cost me around 15-20€ though. \n\nThere’s one design flaw with the recirculation fan on the bottom right. As I did not want any electric parts to be seen I’ve made wooden casings for all the fans and sensors with holes in the direction the fan has to blow air out of and slits in the side of the case so the fan can draw air in. While I feel like the casings look awesome they prohibit cleaning the fans severely which is not really a problem with the upper recirculation fan, but I can occasionally hear tea crumbling into the bottom fan and I can't really get it out of there. Perhaps I will have to add some kind of mash to better protect the fan in the future.\n\nSensors and Fans used: 2 Adafruit Sensirion SHT 45 Sensors, 2 Arctic P12 PWM PST CO Fans for air recirculation and 2 Arctic P12 Max Fans for the 2 way humidity control unit\n\nI’ve attached an Imgur link with more pictures if interested:\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/QgF2TNi",

    "body": "While searching for something to assist with some pretty bad soreness and fatigue from cutting, I saw potassium mentioned quite a few times on Reddit and other places. I realized I am probably pretty deficit, as I eat very little fruits or vegetables, and mainly meats & dairy. \n\nI thought, I don’t want to buy a bunch of bananas and waste calories on them, so I’ll just buy a supplement. 1600 servings for $20 seems like a steal, right? That’s still 400 bananas of potassium, and much cheaper.\n\nWell, thank god I bothered to look up why 1 serving was a 10th of a teaspoon when a banana has 4x+ that, instead of taking a whole teaspoon figuring it would be 2 bananas…because even 4 servings is enough to cause issues with your heart and send you to the ER. And the mortality rate isn’t pretty, severe hyperkalemia (potassium poisoning) can have upwards of a 50% mortality rate. \n\nNow I’m sure there’s plenty of you who are reading this thinking “ha idiot of course everyone knows this” but I assure you, you’re overestimating peoples knowledge of vitamins. Especially ones everyone has heard of, and assume would act the same as the ones in our food. I’m sure plenty of people end up here from TikTok influencers telling them how good certain vitamins are for you, leaving out that the source is crucial. After all, “98% of US adults are deficient” is a pretty convincing stat.  \n\nI ordered a $20 bag of potassium citrate on Amazon from bulk supplements, a brand I’ve used plenty of times before, and I didn’t see a single warning besides the obvious serving size on the back. But as many know, servings size is often a recommendation. And especially when I saw what a low percentage of the daily value was, it made sense to have 10 at once. I am so thankful I questioned it.\n\nAnyways, if this reaches one person who was thinking about taking it, this post will have served its purpose. At 1/10th of a teaspoon, I’d probably just stick with bananas. Oh, and apparently milk and a million other things. Don’t be like me and nearly OD on potassium.  ",

        "body": "I regularly take a potassium citrate supplement in powdered form. It's true that hyperkalemia is incredibly dangerous. While I hesitate to recommend it to other people for this reason, here are a few reasons why I don't worry about it when it comes to my personal use:\n\n1. The RDA of potassium is something like 3.5 grams per day for men, at least the way it's calculated in the US. That's about a tablespoon if you're using potassium citrate in bulk form. Don't use more than that amount in one container for any reason, not that you'd want to anyway (see point 2). The body is very good at holding onto potassium, and there's some evidence that the RDA value was inflated because most people don't get enough, so don't do any more than that.\n\n2. Even if you put that amount in a huge jug, it's going to be one of the worst things you've ever tasted. Seriously, unless your taste buds are fried, you're not going to be able to get it down without some effort. Your taste buds will limit your dose long before your heart (or stomach) does. Don't try to mask the flavor, you'll just end up with pineapple-flavored garbage water.\n\n3. Even if you somehow manage to gulp it down out of sheer willpower, your stomach is probably going to have a bad time. If I happen to eat salty food around the same time as my potassium water, it's a one-way ticket to Diarrhea Town. Fun fact, this is how saline laxatives work.\n\n4. Don't take it as a pill. It will suck even more as the capsule dissolves and drops straight salt into your stomach lining. One of the major complications of potassium supplementation (before you even get to cardiac issues) is gastric and intestinal ulcers from (you guessed it) the salt itself irritating the lining of your stomach and intestines. It also caused major indigestion when I tried it. \n\n\nI take my tablespoon of potassium citrate in a 32 oz Nalgene bottle and sip on it. Once I run out of willpower or drink a bit, then I top it off with just pure water and repeat. The flavor gets better over time as it gets more diluted. You can also start with a smaller scoop if it's really a problem.\n\n\n\nIn short, don't experiment unless you're damned sure that you know what you're doing. I'm not a doctor and I don't think you should do this unless you have a really good reason and can do the math required to not harm yourself in the process.",

Yes, you should always do your due diligence when taking supplements. Yes, definitely talk to a doctor before taking any supplemental potassium if you have any sort of kidney disease or are on certain BP meds.\n\n\nBut that \"1/10 teaspoon\" (ie. 99mg) serving size is because, due to a very old, very misinformed study, they are legally required in the US to limit it to that - which is why every potassium supplement has the same number. For most people, that's almost literally nothing. 2% of your daily potassium needs ain't helping anyone. \n\n\nThe most dangerous thing about the powder is that it's easier to overdose (especially if you're literally just using spoonfuls and not weighing your stuff) and the GI irritation, which is still better than the danger of getting a pill of potassium salt stuck in your esophagus.

It is almost an uncomfortable feeling now, laying down and having my ribs be visible lol. 60lbs seemed so far away in the beginning, but the key is creating a routine and enjoying keto foods you love and keeping your eye on the goal.\n\nTwo tips:\n\n1. Get your electrolytes and drink a lot of water!\n2. Don't forget to focus on fiber intake.\n\n**Electrolytes** seem to prevent 90% of problems people have on Keto. Don't mess around here, just experiment and work your way up with potassium, magnesium and sodium and see what feels right to you. Hydration is important not only to support your overall health, but to help break down fats and as a bonus, carry away crystals in urine preventing kidney stones from having a chance to form. On that note, citrate forms of potassium, calcium an,d magnesium also prevent stone formation.\n\n**Adequate fiber intake** is associated with increased fat loss, feeling fuller and a host of other benefits like preventing GI issues and some heart issues. I aim as a male, for 25 - 35g per day. I hit these with Chia, Flax, Avocado, Berries, Pistachios, Broccoli, Asparagus, and Good Old Psyllium Fiber. Just be sure to work your way up slowly if you have not tolerated fiber well in the past, or are transitioning from a low fiber intake.\n\nI was carb addicted since I was 15 years old when I started gaining rapidly during an abusive relationship. At 33 Years old, despite being married to a wonderful woman, I felt AWFUL every day and sluggish. I could not play with my two-year-old because getting up off the floor was a huge pain. I had skin tags, high fasting glucose readings, low energy, chronic depression, needed naps constantly, etc.\n\nSo, I started with a severe carb restriction to minimize the pain of adapting, around 10g of carbs per day.\n\nWithin two days I noticed improved moods, better sleep, fewer headaches, less swelling in my leg (bone disease), energy returning, easier to recall words and think clearly on the spot at work, a renewed interest in my hobbies, easier to focus and reduced ADHD traits, and of course, I don’t feel very hungry anymore!\n\nRecently, I expanded my diet to include limited bell peppers, zucchini, cucumbers, lots of berries, macadamias everyday, and low oxalate foods in general at this point. I do miss fruit, though I find that having a higher carb fruit once in a while doesn’t kill me and I actually end up losing more weight than the water weight I gain as a result!\n\nWhat is interesting to me personally, is that I actually tried low carb a few weeks ago, allowing up to 60g per day, and I HATED IT. Keto feels so much better for me and I came back after 3 days lol. In it for life!\n\nFor all but 3lbs of this, I did not work out once. I recently reintroduced high volume lifting last week to start building back some muscle and hopefully mitigate at least some looser skin. I plan to continue with high volume until I hit 190 lbs, then transition to a muscle-buildinghigh-volume regimen!\n\nMy typical foods:\n\nDrinks, Supplements, and Electrolytes:\n\n* 16 oz black pour over coffee\n* Electrolytes (Potassium Citrate + Magnesium Citrate)\n* Psyllium Fiber\n* Himalayan salt\n* Garden of Life Multivitamin\n* 2,000 IUs Vitamin D\n* Calcium Citrate\n* Lots of seltzer!\n* Tequila or Dry Wine like Pinot Noir\n* WATER!!\n\nNuts + Snacks:\n\n* Macadamias\n* Pistachios\n* Limited almonds (due to oxalate content)\n* Brazil Nuts\n* Think! Keto Bars (watch the glycerin in these!)\n* Chia Seeds\n* Hemp Seeds\n* Flax Seed\n* Quest Keto Pizzas\n\nMeats:\n\n* Sausage/Bratwurst\n* Grass Fed Burgers (70/30)\n* Rib eye Steak\n* Strip Steak\n* Bacon\n* Chicken Drumsticks/Wings\n* Salmon (sooo much salmon)\n* Scallops\n* Monkfish\n* Zero Sugar Jerky\n* Occasionally Pepperoni\n* Bone Broth\n* Archer 0 Sugar Beef Sticks\n\nDairy and Eggs:\n\n* Duck Eggs (loaded with Protein and fat)\n* Fairlife Whole Milk\n* Gouda/Cheddar Cheese\n* Yogurt\n\nFruits and Veggies:\n\n* Occasional Clementines especially on workout days (not as much carbs as one would think!)\n* Avocado Daily\n* Broccoli\n* Asparagus\n* Shitake Mushrooms\n* Raspberries\n* Blackberries\n* Strawberries\n* Cucumber\n* Zucchini\n* Tomatoes\n* Pickles\n* Arugula\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Edit: Thank you so much for the support and for the awards!

I have been wanting to do this comparison since the minimalist released its peel, and I finally got the chance to that. I have uploaded a video and images for the comparison but I'll first start with the review.\n\nReview\n\n* *Your skin type-* Sahara desert dry skin\n* *Your current climatic conditions-* Hot af\n* *Your current AM/PM routine-*  \n**AM**\\- Nothing, I only apply sunscreen if have to go out  \n**PM**\\- Ponds cold cream (for my double cleanse), cleanser (Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser), tret (twice a week), ordinary peeling solution (once a month), innisfree jeju volcanic mask (once a month), moisturizer (I have like 4-5 moisturizers that I use)\n* *Your age- 22*\n\n**The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* More than a year\n* *Ingredient List-* Glycolic Acid, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Daucus Carota Sativa Extract, Propanediol, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Potassium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Polysorbate 20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n* *Holy Grail but Will Not Repurchase-* I fucking love it, it made my skin so smooth and my complexion brighter. I never had any skin problems before as such, but it just made everything better. I never experienced any sort of purging or irritation with this peel. Although, I will not be repurchasing it because I paid ₹1200 for this even though it lasted more than a year. The availability is an issue too.\n\n**Minimalist AHA BHA PHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* 2 times\n* *Ingredient List-* Aloe Vera Juice, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Gluconolactone, Mandelic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lecithin\n* *Holy Grail but Will Repurchase-* I loved it in the very first go, I saw immediate results much like the ordinary. I did not experience any sort of irritation or purging with this either. I honestly don't have much to say because the results are pretty much identical for both.\n\nComparison\n\n**Texture**\n\nAs you can see in the video below, apart from the colour difference the minimalist one a bit flowier than the ordinary. Also, I like the shape of the dropper of the minimalist one, it's pointy rather than the round tip and it looks classier ( at least to my eyes). That is really it when it comes to the texture and the feel of the products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/mobbuo/video/dxwg1bxpdes61/player\n\n**Application**\n\n*note- i forgot to take my before pics, pls forgive a newbie 😔😔😔*\n\nI did a half-n-half application of the peels. The immediate thing I noticed was the way they applied, ordinary being thicker is slightly easier to spread because it doesn't drip as much as the minimalist.\n\nAlso, idk what it is about minimalist peel but I had to apply it a tad bit more than its counterpart.\n\nThird, minimalist did not burn AT ALL while the ordinary always burns a little, even after a year of consistent use.\n\nIn the images below you can see my skin right after the application of the peels, the results are very much the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kdr544sdes61.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8425c82498afb958897ee5482979129fdc1c07d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion-** I like both, I don't have a preference for one over the other when it comes to the results. The only thing is that minimalist is cheaper and easily available, so I will go for that one instead of the ordinary.",

For those out of the know, nacho cheese sauce, and other smooth processed/commercial cheese sauces use a citrate salt to make the sauce smooth and gooey. As far as I know there are several options of citrates-- sodium citrate and potassium citrate being the most commonly used as food additives. \n\nThe options I'm weighing are sodium citrate and potassium citrate. Does anyone work with these or have a preference? I'm thinking potassium citrate might be a better option since its also an easy dietary source of potassium (as opposed to extra sodium) but its more than twice the price by weight so I thought I would try and ask to see if anyone has a preference or if anyone has noted a taste/behavior/texture difference between the two. Lastly if anyone knows of an even better food additive to make cheese sauces gooey please let me know and I will look it up as well.",

    "body": "Hey /r/xxfitness, in my fitness journey I’ve realized that when it comes to a successful diet, getting the adequate protein and reducing sugar has been paramount to my success.\n\nBecause of the many recipes that are available to us I’ve made my own protein versions of things, pancakes, waffles, cheesecakes but one thing I never really could kill my craving for was cookie dough. Oh cookie dough, I missed it in ice cream and just straight plain. To achieve my goals of losing weight there was no way I could continue to eat cookie dough at the rate I wanted to. \n\nFirst, I experimented with my own concoctions of ricotta cheese & protein powder. The cookie dough texture was on point, but the flavor was just oddly too cheesy.\n\nEverything changed when I discovered IMO syrup (isomalto-oligosaccharides) this syrup is a slightly sweet fiber syrup that allows for the stickiness and doughiness of the cookie dough, without added fructose. (think quest bars).\n\nI’ve been eating this cookie dough on my own for a few months once I perfected the protein flavor to go along with it. I really didn’t see it as more valuable than any other protein dish I had created - I loved cookie dough so I ate it all the time, I didn’t expect others to love it as well.\n\nI began realizing the cookie dough as I shared it with my close friends and family. My family especially has an aversion to “health” foods, and prefers the foods with many added sugars. However, this cookie dough is something they actually **liked** I was surprised to say the least. In the past month my Dad has lost 13 pounds, my mother 10 pounds, and my sister is breaking through her plateau of 170 pounds - coming from her heaviest at 270 pounds 2 years ago. I also wanted to give a shout out to my brother, down from 230 to 185 pounds. He’s a huge fan of the cookie dough and is the one who initially gave me the push to see if others would like it as well.\n\nI'm giving out 50 free samples of protein cookie dough randomly to 50 people who complete this survey. I want to know more about what you all like and maybe there's a little business in here somewhere. Hope to hear back from everyone and see how they like it!\n\n**[Survey](https://proteincookiedough.typeform.com/to/LCYS2t)**\n\nI would like to think my recipe has helped my family, and I hope that others can find it useful in their personal journey.\n\nKnocking down the flavor was the hardest part. I aimed to create something that would not include added sugars or sugar alcohols such as malitol which contribute to stomach pain - and are generally associated with mass produced processed protein bars - generally of which contain ingredients we would rather not put in our bodies.\n\nI’ve made two different versions of my product - [Chocolate chip](http://i.imgur.com/N3dAGnd.png), and [Snickerdoodle - keto friendly](http://i.imgur.com/ZkyFmj6.png)\n\n\nThe goal was to make a cookie dough high in protein and low in calories. No sacrifices were made on the macros or on the taste.\n\nNo bullshit here, this product is non-perishable made to be consumed raw. There are no eggs or typical cookie dough ingredients. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do.\n\n**[Album Here](http://imgur.com/gallery/6OGbD)**\n\n**Here's the ingredients.**\n\nMilk Protein Isolate [80% whey 20% casein], Prebiotic Fiber (Isomalto-oligosaccharides), Almond Milk (Filtered Water, Almonds), Natural and Artifical Flavors, Tapioca Starch, Sea Salt Sodium Chloride, Guar Gum, Potassium Citrate Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium\n\n**EDIT:**\nUmm. Wow. This response was totally unexpected and amazing. We've selected and sent out the first 50 samples, and are getting ready to send out info to those that completed the survey to purchase the cookie dough. Even if you weren't selected you'll be able to get your cookie dough and we're giving $10 off your first order for everyone who completed the survey.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Hey everyone! I just began keto-ing recently and while I've been making sure to get a lot of sodium I was worried that I wasn't getting enough potassium. In considering a potassium supplement I ended up doing LOTS of research and I thought I would summarize my findings and share them here. There's a lot of info out there about *how* to supplement potassium, but I wanted to focus on *whether it's safe to do so* and, if so, *how much* to supplement it. My intention isn't to give a specific recommendation, but to give you some information to help you inform your own decisions, and obviously I recommend consulting with a medical professional. Sorry for the wall of text, but if you're taking a potassium supplement or thinking of taking one I think you'll find this interesting and beneficial.\n\n*****\n\nAt first I had thought, *hey, they've got to make a potassium supplement, right*? Turns out it's not so simple. On one hand you seem to have people chugging *No Salt*, while on the other they're yelling \"don't ever take a potassium supplement! You're going to overdose, go into cardiac arrest, and DIE!\" Meanwhile, even the nutrition experts seem to provide poor guidance. The Council for Responsible Nutrition sets an \"upper level for supplements\" for potassium at 1500mg taken in 500mg doses. The UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals was unable to determine a safe upper limit, but set a guidance level of 3700mg (but states that it may be associated with GI lesions). The FDA, terribly afraid of potassium, sets a 100mg limit, with prescriptions over 100mg requiring the warning label \"there have been several reports, published and unpublished, concerning non specific small-bowl lesions.\"\n\nThe dietary reference intake for potassium in adults is 4700mg\\*, but the average consumption in the North America is about half that. The diuretic effect of a ketogenic diet may cause you to lose additional potassium (especially if you're not getting enough sodium and magnesium!). \"Mild hypokalemia [low potassium] is often without symptoms, although it may cause a small elevation of blood pressure, and can occasionally provoke cardiac arrhythmias. Moderate hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness, myalgia [muscle pain], and muscle cramps, and constipation.\"^1\n\n\\*Note: 4700mg is the \"adequate intake\" level (not enough evidence to set a Recommended Dietary Allowance or RDA) set by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board.^2 The Daily Value (DV) for potassium is still set at 3500mg, so note that this is the number used when calculating percent daily value.^3\n\n**IF YOUR KIDNEYS ARE UNHEALTHY** your ability to excrete excess potassium may be impaired putting you at **GREATER RISK** for hyperkalemia (too much potassium in your blood). The National Kidney Foundation estimates that one in nine adults in the US have chronic kidney disease and many don't even realize it (especially among the elderly).^4 Also be aware that some medications such anti-hypertension drugs and even over-the-counter pain relievers can **increase** potassium retention.^5\n\n*****\n\n# **Don't Trust the Labels!**\nYou may be getting more potassium than you think. According to the FDA, testing for and listing potassium content is **optional** in most cases: \"other nutrients must be included in a food's Nutrition Facts label if the nutrients are added as a nutrient supplement to the food, if the label makes a nutrition claim about them, or if advertising or product literature provides information connecting the nutrients to the food.\"^6 It's likely that if you're using a crowd-sourced nutrient tracking program (e.g., myfitnesspal) that you're missing potassium values for non-obvious foods. For instance: 2 slices of bacon has 93mg of potassium; 1 cup of romaine lettuce has 162mg!^7 But the Nutrition Label on the bag of romaine lettuce I have here has no listing for potassium, and when I searched myfitnesspal for these foods most entries listed a potassium value of 0mg.\n\n*****\n\n# **Magnesium**\nMagnesium is important, too, as it helps in the absorption of potassium. If you're going to take a magnesium supplement, look for magnesium aspartate, magnesium citrate, magnesium lactate, or magnesium chloride, which have better bioavailability (i.e., a higher percentage is able to be absorbed) than the more common magnesium oxide.^8 Some studies have measured the absorption rate of magnesium oxide to be as low as 4%.^9 The RDA for magnesium for men is 400mg for ages 19–30 and 420mg for ages 31+. For women it is 310mg for ages 19–30 and 320mg for ages 31+.^10\n\n*****\n\n# **Potassium Supplements**\nNow, on to the big question – **is it safe to take a potassium supplement?**\n\nOver-the-counter supplements are limited by the FDA to just 99mg. Their reasoning behind this is that potassium in a highly concentrated, rapidly released (i.e., pill) form can be dangerous, but according to *Vitamin and Mineral Safety 2nd Ed.* (2004) \"there is no discernible scientific justification for the FDA threshold of 100mg of potassium for regulation of such products as drugs.\" According to *Vitamin and Mineral Safety*,\n\n>The FNB [Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board] concluded that large amounts of supplemental potassium can cause acute or chronic toxicity, but that there was not enough appropriate data to support a UL [tolerable upper intake level]. The UK EVM [UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals] concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to set an SUL [safe upper intake level], but could support a GL [guidance level]. From the clinical trial evidence judged to be most relevant, UK EVM concluded that \"supplemental doses of up to 3,700 mg potassium per day appear to be without overt adverse effects, but may be associated with gastrointestinal lesions diagnosed by endoscopy.\" Based on this conclusion (with no correction for uncertainty), UK EVM set 3,700 mg as the GL for potassium. It was not specified whether this GL applied to supplemental potassium or total intake from all sources. The UK EVM recognized that the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) in the UK for potassium was 3,500 mg for adults over eighteen years of age, but did not identify any estimate of average potassium intake by the population as a whole.\n\n>The clinical trial data on potassium chloride, together with the epidemiology supporting the safety of larger amounts of potassium from fruits and vegetables, indicate that this nutrient has a wide margin of safety. Clinical trials collectively show no pattern of adverse effects for supplemental potassium of 1,500 mg, with the potassium from foods being unspecified. Larger quantities of potassium as potassium chloride can produce gastrointestinal effects, and these seem more likely if the daily total is ingested all at once, especially on an empty stomach. The UK EVM established guidance indicating that 3,700 mg of potassium was safe, but did not specify the amounts for foods and supplements. The evidence that was used, however, related to supplemental potassium. Considering clinical trial evidence and the apparent safety of potassium intakes as high as 8 to 11 g per day from fruits and vegetables, CRN [the Council for Responsible Nutrition] sets its ULS [upper level for supplements] for potassium at 1,500 mg per day, with the provision that it should be divided into doses no larger than 500 mg each.^11\n\nIn 2006 the European Food Safety Authority concluded that\n\n>Potassium intakes from foods have not been associated with adverse effects in normal, healthy children and adults. The average intake in adults from the diet is 3-4 g and the intake generally does not exceed 5-6 g per day.\n\n>A long-term intake of potassium supplements as potassium chloride of about 3 g per day in addition to intakes from foods has been showed not to have adverse effects. Supplemental potassium in doses of 5-7 g/day in addition to dietary intake has in a few cases, however, been reported to cause conductive effects and compromised heart function in apparently healthy adults.\n\n>Gastrointestinal symptoms have been seen in healthy subjects taking some forms of potassium supplements, e.g. slow release, wax-matrix formulations, with doses ranging from 0.9 to 4.7 g/day or more, but incidence and severity seem to be more dependent on the formulation than on dose. Elderly people may be more vulnerable to adverse effects of potassium due to reduced physiological reserve in renal function or due to drugs affecting potassium balance. Certain other groups are also sensitive to increases in potassium intakes. These include subjects engaging in strenuous activities leading to dehydration, with impaired renal function, on cardiovascular disease drug treatment or other metabolic disorders affecting potassium homeostasis. Case reports of various adverse effects such as hyperkalaemia, conductive effects and compromised heart function have been reported in such subjects after moderate to high acute or sub-chronic intakes of potassium in the form of supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes.^12\n\nSome research has suggested that our Palaeolithic ancestors may have had just 700mg of sodium/day but 11 000mg of potassium/day!^13 But it seems getting even 4700mg every day from dietary sources can be daunting. As far as I can tell, potassium chloride is the supplement most studies examine, but some people claim that potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, or potassium gluconate are easier on their stomachs. This seems like reasonable advice to me: \"unfortunately, one of the major side effects of taking potassium is indigestion, belching, and stomach upset, which can be minimized by following a few suggestions. First, the supplement should be taken after a meal, as having something else in the stomach can protect the lining from becoming upset. It is also recommended to drink 8 ounces of water, and do not lie down for at least 30 minutes to keep it from trying to come back up the esophagus. Another suggestion is to divide the doses up throughout the day to minimize side effects. A slow release version can also help to prevent stomach upset. Slow release medications should not be crushed or chewed, but since many of them are too large to swallow easily, some are scored (have a dividing \"line\" down the middle). It can be broken across the scored area and the two halves can be taken right away, or one can be taken at the next meal.\"^14\n\n*****\n\n# **Sources**\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemia\n2. http://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx\n3. http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064928.htm\n4. http://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/potassium.cfm\n5. http://www.berkeleywellness.com/supplements/minerals/article/potassium-pills\n6. http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064894.htm\n7. http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sodium-potassium-balance/\n8. http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#h3\n9. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11794633\n10. http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#h2\n11. http://www.crnusa.org/safetypdfs/019CRNSafetyPotassium.pdf\n12. http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/ndatopics/docs/ndatolerableuil.pdf (pgs. 409–422)\n13. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet#Sodium-potassium_ratio\n14. http://www.everydayhealth.com/health-questions/potassium/is-there-a-potassium-that-does-not-cause-indigestion-and-belching\n\n*****\n\n# **TL;DR**\nWith healthy kidneys, a daily potassium supplement of up to 1500mg to 3000mg is *probably* safe, but may irritate your GI lining. Try subdividing it into smaller doses (500mg has been suggested) spread throughout the day taken after food and with a lot of water to reduce irritation.\n\nMake sure you're getting enough magnesium, which helps your body absorb potassium.\n\nPotassium values on Nutrition Labels in the US/Canada are optional in most cases. You may be underestimating your potassium intake.",

    "body": "\\*\\*This is extremely long  \n\\*\\*\\*Scroll down then commit to reading this mess I refuse to neatly format for anyone, as it took me that long to write.\n\nThis could help a few people in a big way.\n\nThe most anti-depressive minerals I know. Where lithium is important to talk about, I'd still start with Boron. \n\nBoron from sodium tetraborate, yes, from regular cheap Borax is the best I've tried & I've tried them all! I don't like this form because it's cheaper. I don't really care about the price I just notice it actually works the best.\n\nI like it better than the \"TripleBoron\" bottles too. Or the chelated versions from GNC that sometimes made me a bit fuzzy or irritable. They just don't process cleanly at any dose. The \"3mg\" chelated I'm talking about, which they don't even name the actual chelated version on the bottle. Don't take that type of Boron. That's my own recommendation.\n\nPure, natural borax is very clean & your body appears to assimilate it much better for hormones, pain & energy. The fact that certain people also seem to hate this recommendation, makes me believe the boron conspiracy could be real. Maybe I do believe that certain biochemical investors have stocks in big pharma, suboxone, methadone, fentanyl, and are trying to steer arthritic / pain dependent prospects away from effective minerals like boron.\n\nPeople older than 30 need about 30-50mg of Boron from Borax everyday for proper hormone production, balance, enzymatic function, bone function, pain, arthritis. Something close to this was cited by a doctor in a YT video I saw who knew more about Boron than any other person in the world. Unfortunately did not bookmark it. It's still up there somewhere.\n\nBoron is sooo underrated & most people don't get the right form at the right dose. That's around 300-500mg of actual borax for that % of boron. \n\nIt's not just \"safe\" but your body craves boron in this form & dose. Don't go too much higher. Yes it can also push down riboflavin (slightly) but that's why I throw a multi-vitamin at the end. \n\nCertain minerals just aren't smart at higher doses & can be toxic. Many redditors already know this. Boron is a good example like selenium. Your body needs both, too high of either can become toxic, but too high of anything can be toxic, so I never go \"unreasonably high\" with any of my doses of anything. That's likely Rule #1 of Supplement Club. Even the Boron, personally I only do 200mg a day. Which I worked up to from 100mg a day for 1 week. The higher I go the better I feel in every respect. I will likely slow down at 300mg.\n\nThen Iodine. Normal liquid potassium iodide solution is highly underrated when taken with HIGH PROTEIN meals & boron at the same time. I find that higher doses of iodine not taken with lots of protein, it just gives you lots of catalysts in the blood with nothing to charge. This state of too much iodine & too little food can drive you into anxiety. That's all I'll say about iodine & anxiety because it helps me a lot more for anxiety just by keeping my mood elevated.\n\nLets not forget that iodine is also what converts ephedrine into methamphetamine. Iodine is a very special catalyst. But very strong. So keep the dose lower, start with 225mcgs, but see how quickly you can get to 550mcgs (as you likely won't feel 225mcgs at all, it's low)... then 1100mcgs. Don't go any higher unless you *really feel* you need it would be my advice. If I do 1100mcgs at once I become a fair bit too wired. Like I am right now. In production mode. But when spaced throughout the day with food in smaller doses I never get sleepy after I eat, I digest better, my food seems to be used to actually improve my mood, rather then just make me feel sluggish afterward. Boron also has this effect in me. Never eat any food without a low dose of iodine & boron together at every meal. Seriously.\n\nI've experimented with lower doses of iodine in the past, I left, then came back to slightly higher doses & now I see why various people never shut up about it. And they shouldn't shut up. And I won't either. Iodine is awesome & so is Boron. \n\nps. I know people do much higher doses but seriously, 1000mcg should be plenty high enough to get most peoples levels back up, or \"feel\" them coming up the first few days. I see other people doing 12.5mg (miligrams) iodine, some doing 50mg... personally I think that's insane & overcharging the thyroid with too much iodine. This is how good meth is destroyed & I suspect also a good thyroid.\n\nOn to lithium.\n\nNow if you add 2mg of lithium orotate on top with just 8mg of iron, these 2 also help a lot with mood. You can surely take lithium by itself. But I just take my low dose with iron. And only take it the first 3 days of every week. It seems to wear off after 3 more days, I spend 1 day feeling a bit lithium deficient... then add a low dose back in on Monday again.\n\nThe combination of boron, iodine & lithium are unbelievably powerful for mood.\n\nNow to prevent other electrolytes from being thrown off, that also impact mood (synergistically) add 2000 mg potassium citrate. Why? I can only say that until adding potassium I never realized how key it is for simply battling stress. It really keeps my heart in check like I know for that full day if I start off with a good dose of potassium.. my heart just behaves \"properly\". No speedy beats, no skipped beats, my heart relaxes, slows down & beats nice & normal.\n\nAnd to prevent sodium imbalance from too much potassium I always throw a bit of sodium in there from table salt, usually around 1gm is perfect for me.\n\nMagnesium for me is not that anti-depressive. If you're deficient you'll definitely feel better getting your levels up. That's how I felt the first half year or so. When your levels get up, around 1-2 yrs taking higher doses of magnesium I noticed it was making me too lethargic & tired... and rather than boost my mood it started making me depressed. I could have veered into \"hypermagnesia\" or too much magnesium for a short period.\n\nSo I dropped the dose a lot and now that's what I take. You can play with magnesium dosing, see how lower vs higher doses of calcium effect your mood. I always rely on my mood to change dosing and it seems to never fail me. I understand the lower / upper limits, costs / rewards, and make very basic, reasonable calculations. \n\nSome people might do 6gms potassium citrate a day, or 10gms, I really think 2-4gms is plenty for most people.\n\nLet me mention I also workout / run 5 days a week. If you don't, maybe test half all these doses then double them a month down the road. I don't know. Personally I think regardless of age that we all pee out these things way more than we take them in. That's my suspicion.\n\nNow if you add these last  3-4 things on top of this, it will supercharge everything to a different stage.\n\nDHEA I would not experiment with unless I was over 30.  \nYou really shouldn't need DHEA at a much younger age unless you have a history of abusing  \nopiates. As opiates can cause OPIAD, opiate induced androgen deficiency syndrome. DHEA helps correct this.  \nIt also seems to help correct just getting past the age of 30.\n\nAdd in 12.5mg sublingual DHEA. Test this dose for a month. Then raise to 25mg sublingual after 1 month. 12 months of low dose sublingual DHEA can boost your endorphins / enkalphalins by a level of >>>4. This is very significant in terms of depression. After 12 months levels won't go much higher. But those very power morphine compounds in your brain.. that are 19xs stronger than morphine itself... are also very powerful anti-depressants. More powerful than other basic hormones DHEA helps boost  like testosterone (through androstenediol), estrogen, pushes cortisol levels down, fires up endorphins & nitric oxide that make you relaxed & happy. \n\nIf you presently do a higher dose of oral DHEA, you're totally doing it wrong imho.\n\nI also keep pregnenolone around the house too. I use to do a low dose but like DHEA better for now. I'm not gonna rant about this.\n\n7,500IUs vitamin D stacked with a multi-vitamin, the last 2 ingredients.\n\nIf you suffer from minor depression, moderate depression, severe depression, that you think is being caused chemically... consider targeting everything I mentioned above.\n\nThis is most of what I do everyday & the strongest are really the Boron, Iodine, Lithium, DHEA, vitamin D & Iron. Those 6 taken the right way at the right dose should really be able to shed most your depression. Anyone with mood problems, focus on those 6 before you crawl too deep into the supplement hole.\n\nAfter many many years taking supplements, those 6 are consistently the best anti-depressants I've come across. SAMe is also great but I want to avoid amino acids for the sake of avoiding a very large rabbit hole. We can avoid that rabbit hole by most people just eating enough protein.\n\nGood luck to anyone suffering mood or motivation problems I should also mention that I've become productive to a level I never thought possible. Just by learning to supplement right. CHEERS!",

To achieve my goals of losing weight there was no way I could continue to eat cookie dough at the rate I wanted to. \n\nFirst, I experimented with my own concoctions of ricotta cheese & protein powder. The cookie dough texture was on point, but the flavor was just oddly too cheesy.\n\nEverything changed when I discovered IMO syrup (isomalto-oligosaccharides) this syrup is a slightly sweet fiber syrup that allows for the stickiness and doughiness of the cookie dough, without added fructose. (think quest bars).\n\nI’ve been eating this cookie dough on my own for a few months once I perfected the protein flavor to go along with it. I really didn’t see it as more valuable than any other protein dish I had created - I loved cookie dough so I ate it all the time, I didn’t expect others to love it as well.\n\nI began realizing the cookie dough as I shared it with my close friends and family. My family especially has an aversion to “health” foods, and prefers the foods with many added sugars. However, this cookie dough is something they actually **liked** I was surprised to say the least. In the past month my Dad has lost 13 pounds, my mother 10 pounds, and my sister is breaking through her plateau of 170 pounds - coming from her heaviest at 270 pounds 2 years ago. I also wanted to give a shout out to my brother, down from 230 to 185 pounds. He’s a huge fan of the cookie dough and is the one who initially gave me the push to see if others would like it as well.\n\nI'm giving out 50 free samples of protein cookie dough randomly to 50 people who complete this survey. I want to know more about what you all like and maybe there's a little business in here somewhere. Hope to hear back from everyone and see how they like it!\n\n**[Survey](https://proteincookiedough.typeform.com/to/LCYS2t)**\n\nI would like to think my recipe has helped my family, and I hope that others can find it useful in their personal journey.\n\nKnocking down the flavor was the hardest part. I aimed to create something that would not include added sugars or sugar alcohols such as malitol which contribute to stomach pain - and are generally associated with mass produced processed protein bars - generally of which contain ingredients we would rather not put in our bodies.\n\nI’ve made two different versions of my product - [Chocolate chip](http://i.imgur.com/N3dAGnd.png), and [Snickerdoodle - keto friendly](http://i.imgur.com/ZkyFmj6.png)\n\n\nThe goal was to make a cookie dough high in protein and low in calories. No sacrifices were made on the macros or on the taste.\n\nNo bullshit here, this product is non-perishable made to be consumed raw. There are no eggs or typical cookie dough ingredients. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do.\n\n**[Album Here](http://imgur.com/gallery/6OGbD)**\n\n**Here's the ingredients.**\n\nMilk Protein Isolate [80% whey 20% casein], Prebiotic Fiber (Isomalto-oligosaccharides), Almond Milk (Filtered Water, Almonds), Natural and Artifical Flavors, Tapioca Starch, Sea Salt Sodium Chloride, Guar Gum, Potassium Citrate Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium\n\n**EDIT:**\nUmm. Wow. This response was totally unexpected and amazing. We've selected and sent out the first 50 samples, and are getting ready to send out info to those that completed the survey to purchase the cookie dough. Even if you weren't selected you'll be able to get your cookie dough and we're giving $10 off your first order for everyone who completed the survey.\n\n\n",

Those meds *might* help prevent stones, but they’re not going to get rid of current stones. If he drinks a LOT of water, there’s a chance it might break up into smaller pieces that he can pass, but boars have such tiny urethras. And there’s a risk of blockage. If he is unable to pee, his body will stop functioning. I’d recommend finding a second opinion. You want a vet that primarily treats exotic animals. Cat and dog vets, even if they have an exotic license, don’t usually get enough hands-on time to know how to manage more complex ailments than a URI.

Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

Magnesium does this to me but only to an extent and not the full effect. \n\nIn comes potassium.\n\nSo reading lots of post here you guys recommend No Salt (no sodium but lots of potassium) so I went to Walmart, picked it up and after 20 minutes of taking not even 1/4 tsp my thirst has calmed down by a lot and a tiny bit relaxed. (1/4 tsp = 640mg)\n\nElectrolytes people! Get them in you!\n\nNo Salt cost me under $5 and I feel better at the end of my 3rd day fast. Also, go on amazon and buy potassium citrate in powder form.

    "body": "40y old white female, 110lb, united states, gastritis/pill esophagitis since last November. Medical history of psych stuff, constipation, and hypokalemia for which I take drosperinone and supplemental potassium citrate, which caused this issue in the first place. Currently on 40mg omeperazole. Previous GI office has said that I must undergo endoscopy/colonoscopy in the future with full anesthesia and now feeling unsafe/unclear going in for an endoscopy for the gastritis/pill esophagitis due to the rarity of this recommendation\n\n\n\nLast November I took one of my potassium citrate pills and probably didn't drink enough water and lay down after. In the days following I started noticing a lot of pain after eating certain foods. I had to stop taking the magnesium hydroxide I was taking for constipation, even though it was an antacid it seemed to really hurt and make things worse. I also had to stop the pyridostigmine I was taking off label for constipation as I had a lot of pain after taking the pills.\n\n\n\nA few years ago I got a colonoscopy/endoscopy done at my GI. The sedation used was propofol. When I woke up, the nurse seemed a little freaked out, suspicious, a bit angry even, and told me that going forward I would need to get full anesthesia for any endoscopy/colonoscopy going forward. I was very put off by this reaction and was thinking that I would probably switch to another hospital/clinic as I didn't feel particularly safe or assured after that experience. I tried to look at my medical records and it really didn't say much other than I had some distress and it looked like they used relatively high/increasing doses of propofol (can't remember the exact amount). \n\n\n\nI've since learned that full anesthesia for endoscopy/colonoscopy is extremely rare and would be reserved for maybe something like older patients with complex medical issues, lung disease, etc, none of which are categories I fall into. From my research I can't see anything saying that full anesthesia is the next step if propofol \"isn't tolerated\"\n\n\n\nI was offered an endoscopy by this same clinic last December but as I felt very uncomfortable with how things went I took the steps then to get set up at a new GI clinic while taking 40mg omeprazole, bland diet, cutting out pyridostigmine/magnesium etc. Unfortunately there was a severe backlog at the new GI clinic and they weren't able to schedule me to even see someone in over half a year. The pain was so bad at times even with the omeprazole I went to the ER associated with the hospital clinic I was trying to get into and asked them to code the referral as urgent but it didn't change anything.\n\n\n\nI hoped that things would heal in the meantime but they just haven't. Some days are OK but some days I have a lot of pain when eating and I just don't understand how with over 2 months on 40mg omeprazole it doesn't seem to have healed up substantially. Since things are still so bad I gave the original GI clinic a call this time asking to talk to someone specifically about the full anesthesia used during the endoscopy. I haven't heard back from them yet, but I wanted to ask here because something just doesn't seem right to me about how the original procedure went down and I wanted to know if this is standard practice or would be recommended at all in a case like this.\n\nEdit for clarity: I am sorry I was unclear about this but I have tried to get information from the doctor directly and from medical records. Here is what was on my online chart: \"pt prefers to avoid GA if possible, but per EGD report by Dr. X \"Future EGD will require GA for sedation.\" Nurse procedure note - pt restless and requiring handholding throughout procedure. Discussion with MD, future procedures safest to be scheduled with General anesthesia\" When asking the doctor directly in portal he just said \"It looks like your sedation needs would require you having the scope with the assistance of our anesthesiology team.\"",

You can call and ask to speak to the records department or office manager, you will have to sign a release form. That will most likely give you the full picture of why you tolerated the past procedure poorly. Human physiology varies, people have different reactions to anesthesia that are unpredictable sometimes. I’m one of them myself and I also have a condition that requires somewhat regular endoscopies for life. So my gastroenterologist has clearly written in my chart to have Monitored Anesthesia Care (completely out) going forward because I accidentally had a conscious sedation endoscopy, that was unpleasant. Your doctors are not trying to harm you & they are trying to prevent uncomfortable or further unpredictable outcomes. That’s all. I’m young and pretty healthy, I would always prefer to be knocked out by a kind & knowledgeable anesthesiologist prior to any tube being stuck up or down my GI tract.

All other ingredients and ingredient order the same.\n\n**Kirkland Signature Infant Formula vs Kirkland Signature ProCare Infant Formula**:\n\n* Powder is more dense. 1 scoop = 8.8 g, versus 8.2 g of the previous formula.\n* Makes 5 fl oz. prepared vs 5.3 fl oz prepared of the previous formula (same reason as above).\n* CARBOHYDRATES: 10.5 g -> 10.7 g.\n* WATER: 141 g -> 133 g (probably the reason for the higher density).\n* INOSITOL: 4.9 mg -> 24 mg.\n* IODINE 6 mcg -> 15 mcg.\n* HIGH OLEIC SAFFLOWER OIL appears before WHEY PROTEIN CONCENTRATE on the ingredients list. Perhaps if they found a better way to dehydrate the whey concentrate, the differences above could explain this since the ingredients are listed in order of percentage weight.\n* FRUCTOOLIGOSACCHARAIDE (FOS) moved higher up (by three spots) on the ingredients list.\n* LYCOPENE removed.\n* POTASSIUM CITRATE -> POTASSIUM BICARBONATE.\n* Added MONOGLYCERIDES.\n* CALCIUM CARBONATE -> CALCIUM CHLORIDE, CALCIUM HYDROXIDE.\n* SALT -> SODIUM CITRATE.\n* THIAMINE CHLORIDE HYDROCHLORIDE -> THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE.\n* SODIUM SELENATE -> SODIUM SELENITE.\n* Removed CALCIUM PHOSPHATE.\n* Added POTASSIUM IODIDE.\n\nI was mostly interested in the increased FOS. There have been some studies on its [effect on calcium uptake on adolescents](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/69/3/544/4694202) and [infant gut flora](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23498848), both of them showing favorable results.\n\nIn all, digging through the ingredients and nutrition facts on these three different formulas didn't seem to yield many differences. That shouldn't be a big surprise, since baby formulas are regulated to some extent. It seems like the biggest change in the ProCare is they just reduced the water content, so it's a bit more space efficient.",

As if I'm trapped in my own head.\n\nI tried keto/carnivore and within 4-5 days my brain fog almost vanished, within a week my brain fog had gone completely and I experienced transcendence. I could finally think and see. My memory improved, I could read books without forgetting anything and having to backtrack up the pages. Any \"ADHD\" like symptoms dissipated. Suddenly I became more articulate, and never seemed to have any \"thought on the tip of the tongue\" moments.\n\nI slept less, I slept easier. Colours even seemed more vibrant than before, (I am partially colour blind).\n\nNow, a month in to keto/carnivore it feels like my brain fog has come back about 70-80%? I feel better than I did before starting the diet, but I don't feel like I did a couple of weeks ago.\n\nMy diet consists of 100% grass-fed organic ground beef, organic butter and various cheeses. I also drink coffee.\n\nMy carbohydrate intake is less than 20g a day and I partake in intermittent fasting 16:8 and sometimes 20:4. I eat one or two meals a day as I felt (before) sharpest when I hadn't eaten in a while.\n\nThe supplements I take are:\n\nPotassium citrate with vitamin C (1380mg potassium, 500mg active)\n\nL-theanine (at night)\n\nZMA (Zinc, magnesium, vitamin b6)\n\noccasionally melatonin when I do a lot of night shifts. (done this for a long time)\n\nPlease help as I'm desperate to get back the feeling I had at the beginning of the diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\n\n I did some research on electrolytes and I found that I was taking quite a low amount, especially on days where I only have one meal. I also found that there are different types of electrolytes for better absorption. for example, I was taking magnesium citrate and potassium citrate, whereas chloride and glycinate seem to be better options respectfully.\r  \n\r  \nMy brain fog seems to have consequentially cleared quite suddenly. about 60% in 15 mins, 80% in 30 mins and within an hour I am back to 100% I'd say.\r  \n\r  \nRookie mistake. But if the mods will keep this thread open I'll update in a week to let you all know if I have truly solved the problem.\r  \n\r  \nThank you for the advice.",

    "body": "I’ve seen a couple posts on here of people saying “where did everyone go?” and I wanted to put my story on here for those that like that sort of thing. \n\n(For reference, I was 30 at the time, no prior health issues)\nI got the booster Dec 30th, then covid Jan 14th 2022. Minor acute infection, mainly a dry cough and feeling of someone sitting on my chest, but nothing major. Had some weird feelings that lasted but never thought much of it. Ended up getting hit with the brick wall that is LC in April, after spending a weekend away with my mom for Mother’s Day. I had gotten a deep tissue massage, was drinking most of the day, then I went into the hot tub. I came out with severe vertigo, my eyes weren’t working, super nauseous, tinnitus, head pressure, swollen lymph nodes, so much more. My face was swollen and one big red, hot blotchy rash going from my face to my neck. \n\nThis started a long chain of ER and specialist visits, being bedbound for 5-6 months, and thinking I was dying. I tried every supplement in the book, every tincture I could find research on. I was so alone. My marriage was in shambles because of this. One of the worst times of my life.\n\nI started to write every single thing down in a journal. It was probably a bit overboard but I wanted to have factual data to look back on to know A) I wasn’t crazy and B) I could try and find patterns. And sure enough, I started finding them. I started noticing food/drinks were a problem for me, and most supplements. I started only eating eggs, because I was desperate and hopeful this might be an answer. Around this time I started seeing MCAS pop up and looked more into that. Brought it up with my doctor and we both raised an eyebrow. \n\nThe severe elimination diet WORKED. I cut out supplements, most medications, only drank water, only ate eggs. Once every two weeks I would add in another food, and waited to see how my body reacted. It was pretty easy to tell what I reacted to though, within 20 minutes I would have vision issues, vertigo, elevated HR, POTS symptoms, intense head pressure, neck stiffness, red hot face rash, nausea, migraine, etc. And in the beginning, my body reacted strongly to everything that didn’t work for me. Over time, the reactions lessened, more manageable. I kept a daily journal of everything I did/ate for over a year until I had a concrete list of safe foods. It was trial and error and took a long time but it’s the only thing that saved me. \n\nNow, it’s different for everyone. So I can’t say my safe foods will be the same for you. Or if you’ll even have safe foods. Hell, you might have a type of LC that isn’t MCAS/POTS symptoms. But. It’s something to rule out. To look into at the least, if you haven’t already. I’m on r/MCAS a lot still. \n\nI’m almost at 2 years now and while I’m manageable now, sometimes even forgetting I’m sick for a few moments, I’m nowhere near “normal”. My body will still change occasionally and start reacting to safe foods and I have flares, just not as severe. I have a very strict daily routine to keep my body stable. I don’t think I’ll ever be how I was pre covid but, I’m okay with that. I went through hell last year and I made it out. Not unscathed but I’m alive.\n\nAnd I will say, I’m able to tolerate more things now. Just not often or too much. I can handle a bite of cheesecake, or a sip of a Diet Coke. I usually work out at the gym 3 days a week. I’m limited in movements/exercises but I can still do it as long as I listen to my body and keep my HR down. I try and keep my “bucket” empty trigger wise by only eating my limited amount of safe foods, so when I do want to have something outside of it, I can. It’s a lot of planning and listening to my body, taking rest days when I need to, but it’s working. \n\nI’m not sure why I’m posting this but, I remember at my worst I would religiously search for answers or others I could relate to, or those who could give me hope and, maybe this helps someone. I hope it does. I know I’m not posting on here anymore but I respond to all comments and messages. If you need someone, I’m here. I still can’t work because of my health issues so I’m always around. Please don’t hesitate to reach out. Hang in there friends.\n\nEdit to add: I take qulipta 30mg at night for migraines, 125mg acetazolamide (diamox) once a night for head pressure and/or low blood oxygen (not sure of the why it helps but it helps), and I just recently started 5mg of duloxetine for depression (I took this in the past and it worked until I started reacting to too high of a dose). I also take baby doses of magnesium glycinate (1/8th of a capsule), potassium citrate (1/8 of capsule), 50mg lipothiamine, 18mg iron, and 2.5mg melatonin. If I stop any one of those supplements, I feel worse and have more symptoms come back. Especially the magnesium and lipothiamine. ",

I've spent that time eating almost only lettuce and pears, because my dizziness was so bad I couldn't tolerate almost anything else. When I could, I would eat something else, but most of the time I couldn't. I lost 20% of my body's weight and became malnourished.\n\n The thing is, having that really strict diet didn't help at all with my symptoms, actually I was pretty bad at that point and got better when I was able to eat again (I found mirtazapine witch increases apetite, but in my case only makes food tolerable, and makes my headaches more manageable, still have them everyday but I can kinda control with pain meds most of the time). So, in your opinion, this experience excludes the need for experimenting with this exclusion diet or not? I'm afraid of trying to do this because I already don't eat much daily and I can't lose weight anymore, I need to maintain the weight I gain back ;/ \n\nThanks for sharing your experience!! I'm really glad you have improved!!\n\nEdit: also, you said you take liphotiamine and magnesium and they make a big difference.

    "body": "I wanted to make this post in case it can help someone else.\n\nI have had a chronic vestibular migraine for two years that is largely gone now due to medication and supplements. I was diagnosed by a neurologist and my migraine is chronic, not episodic.\n\nHere is a comprehensive review of meds and supplements and how well they worked. I have tried many things and I have settled on a really good regimen.\n\nMy symptoms were visual distortions, headaches, pressure in face, vertigo, a sense of motion in my vision being wrong, and sometimes nausea. The brain fog used to be severe too.\n\nMy story is similar to everyone else’s: symptoms started, began Nortriptyline, then moved onto other things. The theme with the meds and supplements is that anything that induces vasodilation helps and anything that induces vasoconstriction makes it worse. Many people are the opposite. I found after a lot of experimentation with BP-lowering supplements that my symptoms were markedly better. So I asked to be put on a calcium channel blocker.\n\nI currently take Verapamil SR 120 mg BID, Magnesium 600 mg, and some B2 when needed. I also get a fair amount of benefit from an ADHD med: Guanfacine XR 3 mg. It improves both the migraines and ADHD. It is a BP med.\n\n**Meds (OTC):**\n\nTylenol 1,000 mg - minor improvement.\n\nAdvil 800 mg - nothing\n\nGravol - nothing.\n\n**Meds - Preventatives (Prescription):**\n\nVerapamil SR 240 mg - best medication by far. Symptoms erased. Initial side effects were ED, low libido, and orthostatic hypotension. All improved over 2-3 months.\n\nUnlikely hero: Guanfacine XR 3 mg - an old school BP med that I take for ADHD. Huge benefits to the migraines and it kills a lot of the brain fog too.\n\nEmgality - took this for two months including the loading dose. Did nothing.\n\nNortriptyline 20 mg - moderate improvement. Side effects were not worth it. That being said, if I couldn’t be on Verapamil and I had to take something I’d already tried, I’d take this.\n\nPropranolol 180 mg - worked for a few weeks then required a dose increase. Rinse and repeat. Hit extreme fatigue at 180 mg so I stopped it.\n\nTopiramate - took for two days and stopped due to extreme anxiety it was causing.\n\nGabapentin - made the headache better, visual & vestibular symptoms worse\n\nViibryd 10-40 mg - seems to help somewhat. I get migraine symptoms when reducing it but they always go away.\n\nBetahistine - did nothing.\n\n**Meds - Abortives (Prescription):**\n\nRizatriptan 5-10 mg - worked moderately well but not great for chronic migraines.\n\nMetaclopramide - worked okay. Not amazing.\n\nUbrelvy - did almost nothing even after two tablets.\n\nCelebrex 200 mg BID - mild improvement.\n\n**Supplements:**\n\nMagnesium Bisglycinate 400-800 mg - honestly pretty effective. Keeping my magnesium levels up has been important since I developed migraines.\n\nMagnesium Threonate 50-150 mg - I find 50 mg of this as effective as 200 mg of other forms of Magnesium.\n\nVitamin B2 400 mg - honestly more effective than I thought it would be. I use it in combination with magnesium at times. \n\nCoQ10 100-400 mg - it’s a nice addition but doesn’t do as much as B2 and magnesium. For me, the price doesn’t really warrant the benefits.\n\nVitamin C 2,000 mg - surprisingly helpful as it may induce vasodilation. I use it as an abortive at times. I do not take it regularly.\n\nOmega-3 3,000 mg EPA/DHA - mildly beneficial effect. Seems to lower blood pressure and induce some vasodilation which is helpful.\n\nVitamin K2 MK7 - surprisingly also mildly helpful possibly due to reducing calcium or inducing vasodilation.\n\nVitamin D3 - can actually make the migraines much worse if I do not supplement magnesium at the same time. It can raise calcium and reduce magnesium which can interfere with Verapamil and induce migraines respectively.\n\nL-Arginine 2,000-5,000 mg - surprisingly effective. Post-COVID headaches are thought to be caused by an upregulation of Arginase, plummeting NO production. I don’t take it anymore.\n\nL-Citrulline 2,000-6,000 mg - also surprisingly effective at improving symptoms. I take it in a pinch if I need to reduce symptoms. I rarely use it anymore.\n\nMelatonin 3 mg - surprisingly helpful. It just makes me drowsy the next day.\n\n**No effect:**\n\nCarnitine, ALCAR, ginseng, maca, beetroot powder, Iron Polysaccharide, Vitamin E, B12, Methylfolate, Ginger, GABA, Turmeric, Garlic oil, Zinc, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, taurine.\n\n**Meds that make it worse:**\n\nVyvanse, Wellbutrin, Potassium Citrate 300 mg, L-tyrosine, caffeine in amounts greater than 200 mg.\n\n——-\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me and I’ll do my best to get back to you. My symptoms are virtually gone, with the odd hiccup.\n\nETA: I’m a 32 yo male also diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. Also just because I listed a dosage of a certain supplement does not mean you should take that much. \n\nETA2: if you want to see if the vasodilators are effective for you, what tipped me off was having success taking L-arginine 1,000 mg 3x per day for a few weeks. Then I tried propranolol, then moved onto Verapamil and it worked the best.",

        "body": "Propranolol didn’t do much for me (also chronic VM, previously daily down to 16ish per month now) but for some reason atenolol has been hugely successful. We initially tried it because propranolol inflamed my asthma, but the atenolol has a longer half life and thus I think a much smoother affect, even at a low dose, which helps SO much with my migraines and my anxiety. \n\nEveryone sleeps on B2 and magnesium. They single handedly reduced my migraine days by like 3 or 4 a month and they’re not even drugs :P \n\nI guess as a silly comparison because I also have VM this is my med lineup:\n- Mirtazipine 15mg - helps a lot with my nausea, had bad side effects from nor/amitriptyline before too so switched to this. Mirtazipine is a tetracyclic not a tricyclic so it works a bit differently. Wish more migraine patients were prescribed it \n- Atenolol 25mg - like I said\n- Lamotrigine 125ng - was originally put on this for bipolar but it’s helped my migraines a lot. Unlike topamax it doesn’t make me feel brain dead either, I have never felt a single side effect from it actually. \n- fluoxetine 10mg - for my ocd but helps a bit too. Low dose because it is synergistic with Mirtazipine \n- emgality - does nothing 💀 my doc wanted me on ajovy in the first place because it works better for VM but insurance is fucking stupid \n- Botox - god it helps so much and it helps more every time I get it. If my insurance ever tries to deny it I will fight kicking and screaming. Whereas everything else here was just incremental improvements Botox immediately cut my migraine days by a lot. \n- Ubrelvy - whereas Nurtec did nothing for me (and actually I think I was mildly allergic), Ubrelvy can kick a migraine like 50% of the time for me, and reduce it like the other 40% of the time. \n- Frovatriptan - I hate the way it makes me feel (anxious and roided out lol)but it’s useful for days where I absolutely cannot afford to have a migraine. It’s a very long acting triptan, so you have to take it as soon as you wake up, long before you feel a migraine coming on, and it works for 24hrs. I only use it a couple times a month. I highly recommend it as a backup option. \n- Klonopin - god benzos are amazing for vertigo. Gotta be careful with them though, so I only use it a few times a month. \n- Zofran, compazine in rotation for nausea \n- Voltaren gel!!! If you haven’t tried this stuff you should!! It’s not approved in the US for this but it is in other countries. I put it on my neck, behind my ears, and above my trigeminal nerves. It really punches above its weight. \n- MigShield - all in one magnesium, coq10, and riboflavin supplement. My beloved \n- Liquid IV - one a day makes a big difference for me. Fucking expensive though \n\nEdit: more meds :P",

    "body": "I've lost 100 lbs in the last 218 days. Here are some pics (shirtless fat man may be NSFW). http://imgur.com/a/UKVcU  \n  \nThis subreddit has given me lots of inspiration, and I am very grateful to the redditors that share their progress... so doing my part.  \n  \nPeople usually ask \"how\" and what people are eating. The first 5-6 weeks, I concentrated on <20g carbs per day only. If I was hungry, I ate more. If I had a killer craving for carbs, I drowned it in meat and cheese. Total calories per day was not a concern as I weaned myself off carbs.  \n  \nAfter that initial carb withdrawal and fat adaptation phase, I adopted a pretty hardcore calorie deficit of 35%-40% per day and readjusted total calories every couple weeks.  \n  \nThere were some bumps in the road. I had to have an emergency gallbladder removal. I ate carbs for 10 days after the surgery (graham crackers, PBJ sandwiches... e.g., comfort food), that set me back about 3 weeks total as I put on a spike of water weight and had to remove it and get back into ketosis. The other bump was a motorcycle accident last month. I didn't eat carbs, but I ate a calorie surplus for a bit.  \n  \nRegarding my habits, I pretty quickly went to IF 18/6 (eating lunch at around noon and dinner at around 6pm). I now mostly do one meal a day at either noon or 6pm. I've also occasionally done some longer fasts of 48-66 hours.  \n  \nOver the last couple months, my one meal a day is often a protein shake with about 80g protein and about 110g of fat from heavy whipping cream (with a little added water it reminds me of chocolate whole milk). I find the shakes to be a great way to hit the exact macro mix and total calories I am targeting.  \n  \nThe other 3-4 days per week, I eat \"meat and cheese in a bowl\". Things like taco meat and cheddar, pepperoni and mozzarella, et cetera. I occasionally go out for dinner and grab a steak and steamed broccoli. I eat almost no vegetables and don't seem to miss them.  \n  \nI supplement electrolytes using iodized salt, powdered potassium citrate and magnesium glycinate pills. And a 1/day multivitamin. I add a little salt and potassium to my shakes/meatbowls and to a 20-calorie mug of beef broth that I drink before bed each night, with the magnesium pills. When I fast, I still have 1-2 mugs of 20-calorie beef broth per day with electrolytes.  \n  \nNo exercise, and I have a desk job.  \n  \nThat about covers it, but I'm happy to answer questions.  \n  \nKCKO, and thanks to all of you for the continued inspiration!  \n  \n  \n**EDIT:   \nAs a bit of history, around 17 years ago I did a low carb diet, dropped 90 lbs and kept it off a couple years. I was around 30 and much more active. I was eating lots of eggs, chicken breasts, salads... it was much higher in protein than I am currently eating. And I was dutifully spreading those calories out over 5 small meals per day, as was the common wisdom back then.  \n  \nUnfortunately, life happens. I stopped eating low carb. The weight started creeping back. I wasn't too worried, because I now knew that \"low carb\" was the secret to my weight loss and I could \"quit carbs any time\".  \n  \nHowever, I have had a heckuva time recapturing that low carb magic as I grew to 355 lbs over the last dozen years. Being older, more sedentary, more insulin resistant... for some reason I couldn't do what I did at 30 and be successful. I'd never last more than 2-7 weeks before falling off the wagon.  \n  \nThe two big changes introduced to me by this board that have led to success this time: intermittent fasting and no excess protein. Only having 1-2 big, fatty meals per day leaves me feeling full and content in a way that snacking and having excess protein has never allowed me to do. Those two changes have nuked my cravings/appetite and allowed me to pursue such an aggressive calorie deficit.",

It’s tasty, and a great way to get in over 2 grams of sodium in one go.## **11 Homemade Electrolyte Drink Recipes**\n\nIn the many years we spent mixing electrolyte homebrews before LMNT existed, you can imagine we found a good recipe or two.\n\nBelow are a few electrolyte drinks you can prep at home. It’s a little more work, but on the plus side you’ll feel like a mad hydration scientist.",

    "body": "I have become extremely concerned  about low potassium levels in general in the modern American diet, but as a former coffee addict and someone still struggling to be at 0% caffeine intake, I am interested specifically in the caffeine / potassium connection.\n\nAs it stands, fewer than 2% of the US meets the insanely high 4,700mg potassium requirement with an average intake of only 1,755 mg ([source](https://blog.watson-inc.com/nutri-knowledge/what-does-4700-mg-of-potassium-look-like)). This is, of course, usually paired with a very high level of sodium. Clearly this shows that the majority of us are working at a severe potassium deficiency even without caffeine in the picture.\n\nSo let's look at the caffeine connection. According to this [case study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3046007/), \" it is empirically known that ingestion of caffeine (especially in large amounts) can induce hypokalaemia.\" Hypokalaemia is defined as a significantly low level of potassium in the bloodstream.  So working at already low levels for the average American, a good portion of us are dumping huge amounts of caffeine daily into our bodies which further leeches the potassium we actually do consume from our diet.\n\nSo what are the symptoms of hypokalaemia? Weakness and fatigue, muscle cramps, digestive problems, heart palpitations, muscle aches, breathing issues, mood issues ([source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/potassium-deficiency-symptoms#TOC_TITLE_HDR_9)). Interesting how some of those symptoms align with the common issues discussed in this group.\n\nFor the past week, I've substituted my normal morning coffee with hydralyte plus, which is an electrolyte formula containing some potassium. In addition, I've used 1 serving of No Salt (about 700mg of potassium) once in morning + once at night with water and also consumed some foods high in potassium to get me to around 3,000-3,500 mg a day of potassium (logged via MyFitnessPal app).\n\nSo far this experiment has worked out incredibly well thus far.  I have loads of energy and my natural cravings for caffeine have subsided significantly. I haven't been able to reach 4,700mg, but I'm close. Certainly more potassium than I've consumed in decades. I'm hoping to continue this to see the long term impact, but this is the most optimistic I've felt in a long time regarding kicking the habit for good. I have natural energy, mental clarity, better mood. It seems too good to be true.\n\nHave any of you experimented with potassium intake to combat caffeine addiction?  I'm interested in seeing what others think about this potential link.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**UPDATE :** For those interested,  I found something called Keto K1000 electrolyte powder that has 1000mg of potassium citrate, which is said to be superior to No Salt's potassium chloride. I'll  be taking 1 scoop of this every morning and will stop using No Salt completely. I am going to attempt to get all the rest of my daily potassium from food sources. I am not doing Keto, but this seems like an excellent product to up your potassium levels assuming you don't have underlying kidney disease or are on medication which impacts potassium levels.  Good luck!",

Multiple times ER docs called it for constipation and we would hang out on the PEG treatment for some period of time. \n\nOnce she was diagnosed we largely attributed the past pain to stones. But it has continued even when the stones had all been cleared, made us keep digging and looking. \n\nThe pain is in her bladder area. It happens almost every morning now. Usually around a 5 or 6 level of pain that she doesn’t even mention unless I ask. Sometimes it gets really bad and she starts vomiting. \n\nPediatrician is back to calling it constipation. We did a full clean out using pico salax. Have been on PEG for 7 months.  \n\nThis past week she started having incredible ’bladder’ pain - screaming, vomiting, etc. it progressed over 3 days. Each day she was  very unwell and lethargic for the entire day. On the third day I realized her face and eyes were swelling - I took her to the local ER (we are at our cottage, 3 hrs from the nearest Pediatric hospital). \n\n100% of her labs came back normal - blood and urine. No sign of blood in her urine or other stone markers. CT of her abdomen revealed nothing except bilateral renal stones, 6 mm and 5 mm, in the lower poles. \n\nUrology nephrology both said it was not their systems. A referral to paediatric G.I. was kicked back so that community paediatrician could deal with it.  A referral to rheum was also kicked back without explanation. All the normal tests have been done, including thyroid, celiac, inflammatory, etc. All normal. \n\nWhere do we go now?  What do we do?  Who do we ask? Literally every dr we have spoke to has suggested functional pain, but this this week’s episode I am calling bull on that. \n\nWe are in Canada. I can ask for a second opinion at the other university hospital in the area. I can also go down the Rare Stones and Hyperoxaluria Clinic at Mayo, but that will be all out of pocket.  \n\nWhat are my options?  What is next?  \n\nEdit: I did give her 2 Benadryl after ER with no appreciable effect.  \n",

        "body": "Hi. I'm just in general medicine for adults, so pediatrics is a bit out of my wheelhouse. That being said, I like rare disease and this condition appears to be something that I've read a little bit about.\n\n**Short clinical summary:**\n\nJust to bring other folks up to speed, a kidney stone is typically made of calcium and oxalate, called calcium oxalate. It shows up on CT scan. There is a tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder called the ureter. These kidney stones, when they go down the ureters, can be excruciatingly painful as they don't look like pebbles but rather frequently have jagged edges, tearing into the sides of the ureters leading to excruciating pain, bleeding, and sometimes vomiting due to the pain.\n\nIn primary hyperoxaluria type 2, a genetic mutation (GHPR gene mutation on chromosome 9p11) leads to excessive urinary secretion of oxalate, making calcium oxalate stones more likely. Patients are first symptomatic in early childhood between 3-8 years of age. In 1/4-1/3 of cases, there is risk of end stage renal disease by the age of 40 years. As kidney function decreases, oxalate levels increase in the blood with risk of vision damage, thyroid damage, heart electrical conduction damage. This oxalate deposition can also affect the bone and joints and may lead to calcified nodules on the fingers. 1/3 of patients maintain normal renal function and hopefully would not develop these symptoms. Patients may develop bone pain, osteodystrophy (bone breakdown), and multiple fractures. High levels of calcium in the blood and low hemoglobin are possible in this condition as well.\n\nSimple urine tests might show red blood cells, white blood cells, protein, and/or ketones. Advanced urine tests can show a pattern consistent with this condition *(Elevated urinary L-glycerate-to-creatinine ratio, elevated spot urinary oxalate, Elevated urine glycerate and oxalate, elevated 3-aminoisobutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, 3-hydroxypropionicacid, 2-ethyl-3-hydroxpropionic acid)*. Imaging modalities such as ultrasound and CT can visualize kidneys and see signs of renal dilation or damage if present. Ultimately, this diagnosis is made on genetic analysis.\n\nIn terms of treatment, Increasing water intake to >2.5L/m2 surface ***\\[for your daughter that would be 4.25 Liters a day, which is truly a very large amount of water. Specifically for your daughter with  facial swelling and weight gain I WOULD NOT, I repeat, WOULD NOT recommend this at this time\\]***, Vitamin B6 supplements, Vitamin E supplements may help. Avoiding foods high in oxalate such as rhubarb, chocolate, spinach, tea, potatoes, spinach, soy products, vitamin C, star fruit. Avoiding high sodium diet, avoiding dehydration. Encouraging foods such as bananas, papaya, and milk products might be considered ***(with close followup of her electrolytes)***. If there is dangerous kidney swelling a tube placed in the kidney called a nephrostomy tube may be helpful. In cases of severe kidney disease, intensive hemodialysis may be indicated. There are cases where patients are given orthophosphate and/or potassium citrate, although I would defer to my nephrologist colleagues for evaluating the labwork accurately and assessing indications for initiation of those medications. Unfortunately most genetic conditions don't have cures, although for this condition there have been cases of successful treatment with combined liver kidney transplant, the kidney transplanted due to that case having severe kidney damage, and the liver transplanted due to liver producing the oxalate that leads to stones and all the downstream effects. I am curious if a specialist would think that a liver-kidney transplant would dramatically improve your daughter's trajectory. (comment continues below in replies)",

I've never experienced keto flu, but I was getting muscle cramps and waking up feeling very hot at night.  This Keto Reddit community has been very helpful as I figured out that my electrolyte levels were off.  I began supplementing K, Na, Ca, and Mg, which has made a big difference.  Part of that supplementation is from drinking ketoade.\n\nI've been drinking ketoade almost everyday.  Here's my basic recipe:\n1/4 tsp Morton Lite Salt, \n1 Tbsp Magnesium Citrate, \n1 squirt of Mio or other brand zero carb flavor, \n~18 oz water\n\nI found magnesium citrate liquid in 10oz bottles for 99 cents at Walmart.  It's primarily sold as a heavy-duty laxative for people who are preparing for a colonoscopy.  The label recommends disposing it 24 hours after opening.  I've been keeping the opened bottles in the fridge and stretching it to two or three days.  Does anyone ignore the 24-hr rule completely?  It doesn't seem to be a product that should spoil after a day.  Or does anybody use magnesium citrate powder instead?\n\nI've seen other ketoade recipes that include potassium citrate.  That seems like a good idea to boost the K.  Does anybody here use potassium citrate?  The stuff is hard to find in powder form, but I see a couple of online sources.\n\nDoes anyone have other ketoade secrets to share?",

I was diagnosed by a neurologist and my migraine is chronic, not episodic.\n\nHere is a comprehensive review of meds and supplements and how well they worked. I have tried many things and I have settled on a really good regimen.\n\nMy symptoms were visual distortions, headaches, pressure in face, vertigo, a sense of motion in my vision being wrong, and sometimes nausea. The brain fog used to be severe too.\n\nMy story is similar to everyone else’s: symptoms started, began Nortriptyline, then moved onto other things. The theme with the meds and supplements is that anything that induces vasodilation helps and anything that induces vasoconstriction makes it worse. Many people are the opposite. I found after a lot of experimentation with BP-lowering supplements that my symptoms were markedly better. So I asked to be put on a calcium channel blocker.\n\nI currently take Verapamil SR 120 mg BID, Magnesium 600 mg, and some B2 when needed.\n\n**Meds (OTC):**\n\nTylenol 1,000 mg - minor improvement.\n\nAdvil 800 mg - nothing\n\nGravol - nothing.\n\n**Meds - Preventatives (Prescription):**\n\nVerapamil SR 240 mg - best medication by far. Symptoms erased. Initial side effects were ED, low libido, and orthostatic hypotension. All improved over 2-3 months.\n\nEmgality - took this for two months including the loading dose. Did nothing.\n\nNortriptyline 20 mg - moderate improvement. Side effects were not worth it. That being said, if I couldn’t be on Verapamil and I had to take something I’d already tried, I’d take this.\n\nPropranolol 180 mg - worked for a few weeks then required a dose increase. Rinse and repeat. Hit extreme fatigue at 180 mg so I stopped it.\n\nTopiramate - took for two days and stopped due to extreme anxiety it was causing.\n\nGabapentin - made the headache better, visual & vestibular symptoms worse\n\nViibryd 10-40 mg - seems to help somewhat. I get migraine symptoms when reducing it but they always go away.\n\nBetahistine - did nothing.\n\n**Meds - Abortives (Prescription):**\n\nRizatriptan 5-10 mg - worked moderately well but not great for chronic migraines.\n\nMetaclopramide - worked okay. Not amazing.\n\nUbrelvy - did almost nothing even after two tablets.\n\nCelebrex 200 mg BID - mild improvement.\n\n**Supplements:**\n\nMagnesium Bisglycinate 400-800 mg - honestly pretty effective. Keeping my magnesium levels up has been important since I developed migraines.\n\nMagnesium Threonate 50-150 mg - I find 50 mg of this as effective as 200 mg of other forms of Magnesium.\n\nVitamin B2 400 mg - honestly more effective than I thought it would be. I use it in combination with magnesium at times. \n\nCoQ10 100-400 mg - it’s a nice addition but doesn’t do as much as B2 and magnesium. For me, the price doesn’t really warrant the benefits.\n\nVitamin C 2,000 mg - surprisingly helpful as it may induce vasodilation. I use it as an abortive at times. I do not take it regularly.\n\nOmega-3 3,000 mg EPA/DHA - mildly beneficial effect. Seems to lower blood pressure and induce some vasodilation which is helpful.\n\nVitamin K2 MK7 - surprisingly also mildly helpful possibly due to reducing calcium or inducing vasodilation.\n\nVitamin D3 - can actually make the migraines much worse if I do not supplement magnesium at the same time. It can raise calcium and reduce magnesium which can interfere with Verapamil and induce migraines respectively.\n\nL-Arginine 2,000-5,000 mg - surprisingly effective. Post-COVID headaches are thought to be caused by an upregulation of Arginase, plummeting NO production. I don’t take it anymore.\n\nL-Citrulline 2,000-6,000 mg - also surprisingly effective at improving symptoms. I take it in a pinch if I need to reduce symptoms. I rarely use it anymore.\n\n**No effect:**\n\nCarnitine, ALCAR, ginseng, maca, beetroot powder, Iron Polysaccharide, Vitamin E, B12, Methylfolate, Ginger, GABA, Turmeric, Garlic oil, Zinc, sodium chloride.\n\n**Meds that make it worse:**\n\nVyvanse, Wellbutrin, Potassium Citrate 300 mg.\n\n——-\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me and I’ll do my best to get back to you. My symptoms are virtually gone, with the odd hiccup.\n\nETA: I’m a 32 yo male also diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. Also just because I listed a dosage of a certain supplement does not mean you should take that much. ",

I couldn't figure out what was going on. I think that reading your notes explained the answer. He's severely vitamin d deficient, amongst others, and I had upped that dose. (Titrating up slowly) At the same time he's slacked on taking his night meds, because he has ADHD and anxiety as well. I bet his magnesium / vitamin D levels are off. \n\nHe also had a big reduction in symptoms when he started Vit K2 Mk4 45 mg. When he started this he went from not being able to drive to driving safely in our little town. He's still not good enough for city driving or driving alone,  but it's a big improvement.

    "body": "Anyone develop gout while on keto?\n\nMy uric acid was 5.1 in early 2020.  After 6m on keto my uric acid was a 7.5 2m ago.  Just got back a result that is a 7.7\n\nI don’t eat THAT much meat.  A steak for dinner or 12 ounces of grilled chicken.  \n\nCould the effect of filtering ketones (competition of kidneys filtering ketones so can’t filter uric acid) being making my uric acid high?\n\nI’m not sure what to do as I’m on this ketogenic, super low carb no grains no dairy diet and it’s helping mh auroimmune.  If I can’t eat meat there’s nothing left to eat but fats and a few veggies.  Can’t quit because it helps my autoimmune, but don’t want to get gout…\n\n\nAt what level is uric acid a risk?\n\n\n\nEDIT:  Since posting Ive done nothing but read papers on the subject.  I came across two scientific papers/studies in particular which tracked the evolution of uric acid on keto.  The conclusion was that uric acid will initially spike in ketosis (typically double, so a person w a uric acid of 6 will see a quick spike to 12), which is why people are at increased risk of a flare in the first few weeks of ketosis.  The idea is that the body likely can’t distinguish between good ketones and bad uric acid initially.  After 4-8 weeks it typically normalizes back to baseline as the body adapts to ketosis, and the decrease in inflammation in ketosis actually lowers gout risk long term.  \n\nI think that this is why many of the responses here have noted flares initially, or when going in and out of ketosis\n\nSome people however, like myself it seems, seem to have problems adapting to ketosis, or are making basic mistakes.  Increased hydration (a full 128 ounces, which I’m bad at and may be playing a role for me.  Probably have 40), electrolytes and citrate/citric acid (potassium citrate or 2 lemons a day in water) can help lower levels and protect the kidneys while the body figures this out. I will follow this for a month and report back",

    "body": "Hey, axcho from [Super Body Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/) here. :)\n\nAfter [almost a year](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/4rynqc/mct_oil_powdered_with_acacia_gum_hypoallergenic_0/), we've finally gotten our hands on our very own custom-made, keto-friendly (0g net carbs), hypoallergenic, acacia-based **MCT oil powder**, and have added it to our [Keto Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) formula! :D\n\nMCTs (medium-chain triglycerides) are a form of saturated fat that the body converts directly to ketones, the energy source that the ketogenic diet is named for. *And in case you're wondering, the breakdown in our mix is about ~~70%~~ 60% C8 and ~~30%~~ 40% C10 triglycerides, according to our supplier.* **We now include a little over 1/2 tablespoon of MCTs per meal of Keto Fuel, so you don't have to go out and buy it (and measure it) yourself.** That's enough to keep your brain running on a glucose-restricted diet like keto, so you'll have a more pleasant adaptation experience. :)\n\nSame price, just a better, more convenient (and less dusty!) product. ;)\n\nNot only that, but we've also incorporated **two other updates that have greatly improved the flavor.** The first is a **new rice protein** that is the best we’ve had so far, both in taste and texture. The other is a **new form of potassium**, with a much more neutral flavor. We’ve phased out Potassium Citrate, which is very bitter and sour, and replaced it with Potassium Bicarbonate, which is the most neutral-tasting potassium source we’ve found, according to our taste tests and the feedback of our volunteers. This should make a big difference in both [Keto Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) and [Light Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/light-fuel/) especially, as they are high in added potassium. Not only that, but it has allowed us to reduce the amount of Monkfruit Extract used as a sweetener, which should reduce the sweetener aftertastes that some people experience.\n\nYou can read more on [the blog](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/july-2017-update/). :) **All of the [Keto Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) flavors *except Plain* have switched over to the new version**, with MCTs, new rice protein, and potassium bicarbonate.\n\n*And because of that, we're also putting [Keto Fuel Plain](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) on sale ($40 instead of $50!) until we sell off the old stock! ;)*\n\nI'm really excited to hear what you all think of the new version. Please share when you've had a chance to try it! :D",

    "body": "Thanks for all the great information on this forum- especially the fantastic info on electrolytes which helped me progress after reaching a plateau.  \n\nI've lost approximately 12 pounds since August 12th (it's October 1st today).  My stats:\n-Male, 5'10\", starting weight was between 182-184 lbs (probably 184 (BMI was above 25) , but I'll use 182 for my calculations on weight loss).  \n-currently 170lbs as of this morning.\n\nMacros: targeting above 70% fat- trying for 80% but that's been difficult, though Linda's Low Carb Recipes has helped lately.  Less than 40grams net carbs.  Around 100g protein per day.\n\nI followed the typical pattern described on this and other websites of rapid weight loss followed by stalling at 174/175lbs for a couple of weeks.  I attribute breaking out of my stalled weight loss to reading about and tweaking my electrolytes as per  much advice on this website.  I was NOT getting enough Na, Mg, or K according to MFP app.  \n\nMy current micros/electrolytes:\n5000mg Na\n3500mg K\n1000mg Ca\n\nI obtain the electrolytes by drinking salt water and supplementing with Ca tablets when I come up short.  I typically drink 2-3 servings of sea salt (taken in 1/2 tsp servings) to get my Na; as well as 2-3 servings of Lite Salt (1/2 tsp serving) per day to reach my K quota.  I find it easiest to just chug down a very small glass of water with the salt mixed in.  It's nasty, but you grow accustomed to it quite easily.  I don't like drinking broth as it's too time consuming, an added expense, and I don't love the taste.  \n\nI've had HORRIBLE back spasms for going on a couple months.  I think this may be due to my  lack of appropriate electrolytes.  The spasms have been so bad that I can only sleep for about 3-4  hours at a time and then have to get up and put heat on it, and/or use a foam roller.  Laying on my stomach, side, back, all were painful.  I've got a fairly high tolerance for pain due to some issues with a chronic disease, so I know the pain was significant for the past couple months.  The pain/spasms seem to be getting better after recently tweaking my electrolytes.  The addition to Lite Salt has been especially helpful as I previously tried to take Potassium Citrate supplements and those caused digestive distress.  But the Lite Salt does not seem to have the same harsh effects on my digestive tract.  Also, having a Ca/Mg combo supplement on hand to take at night when I'm low on my Ca goals may have helped as well.  \n\nGood luck to everyone on this Keto journey, and thanks to the organizers of this Reddit and the community in general for all the wonderful information and helpful advice.  \n\nSome random websites/books I've found helpful:\nDr. Peter Attia, eatingacademy.com\n\nThe Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living, by Volek and Phinney\n\nStrong- app for tracking workouts.\n\nMyfitnessPal- sounds like everyone knows about this one already.",

    "body": "**Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, you can overdose on potassium supplements, and you should never base your medical decisions off of a random internet post**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA few days ago, MyFitnessPal updated its app and now nutrient info is available to see for each day, week, etc.  Quick backstory, I've been stretching for months and trying different supplements after my symptoms got bad enough in February to make me see a urologist.  The urologist, of course, was no help.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn MFP, I noticed some minor deficiencies in my diet and started googling each of them.  I was only getting about 1,500mg of Potassium per day.  The recommended dose is 4,700mg per day, but MFP said I only need about 3,500mg.  Either way, I figured I was deficient.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPotassium deficiencies can cause:\n\n* Muscle weakness and cramps (my feet would cramp a lot during stretches)\n* Tingling and numbness (my pelvis and genitals mostly felt numb)\n* Frequent Urination (yep)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd what does Potassium do?\n\n> \"It helps regulate **muscle contractions**, maintain **healthy nerve function**, and regulate fluid balance.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOk, it's worth a shot, so I researched supplements and reminded myself to buy a bunch of bananas at the store.  I ended up ordering Potassium Gluconate because I read: \"*Potassium citrate is a diuretic and electrolyte replenisher, Potassium Gluconate is needed for transmission of nerve impulses and cardiac contraction*.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe store was out of bananas, so I bought dried apricots and raisins.  The supplement also arrived.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWithin hours of eating a serving of dried apricots and taking one 99mg supplement, I could feel my symptoms getting better.  My pelvis felt looser, nerves were tingling as the muscles relaxed, and sensation was returning.  Over the past few days, I've been trying to get at least 3,500 mg of potassium via apricots, raisins, bananas, and supplements.  I wanted to see if it would keep improving.  I can now safely say that, for me, getting enough potassium has relieved symptoms that months of stretching did not.  It also relieved symptoms that I didn't realize I had, but they aren't pertinent for CPPS.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNext, I started searching to see if anyone else made this connection.  I saw a lot of posts about supplements, but almost nothing about potassium.  I did find the following, though:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* \"In cases of severe or prolonged hypokalemia (low potassium), muscle breakdown occurs due to cramping of the muscle and atrophy, as the proper concentration of potassium in the muscles keeps them working properly. This breakdown of muscle causes toxic substances to be released into the surrounding muscle and bloodstream (a process called rhabdomyolysis). These toxic substances surround the remaining healthy muscle and the nerves and cause pain.  So, **to summarize, low potassium --> dysfunctional muscles --> muscle death --> toxic substance release --> activation of pain nerve endings.** Make sense?\" - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/hj1sk/why_does_low_potassium_cause_really_really_sore/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* [Frequent Urination and Potassium Deficiency from r/PelvicFloor](https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/qygmpf/frequent_urination_and_potassium_deficiency/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* \"A deficiency in any of these electrolytes can cause muscle cramping, muscle spasming, and fatigue. **I have found from experience that when I start to run low on any of them my pelvic floor is the first place that I begin to experience discomfort in.**\" - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/oi8tnw/dont_forget_to_look_at_your_intake_of_sodium/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd what all can deplete potassium levels?  Alcohol, caffeine, salty foods, intense exercise (running and weights for me), etc.  Basically, a lot of the diet and behavior triggers that so many of us experience.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo sum up, I'd do the following if you suspect you have a potassium deficiency.  Buy some dried apricots, raisins, and bananas.  Try to get a full helping of potassium for a couple days, and see what happens.  You'll know by then if that's what is causing your symptoms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope this helps and I'll try to respond to any questions in the comments!",

Hoping that it’s due to it still healing after being inflamed for months. I’m going to wait until 4 weeks to get retested and will update again.\n\nUpdate 40-days later: I tested last week and today got a negative ureaplasma test result. I am still feeling drastically better than I was before. I am also still taking uquora, aloe, benedryl (at night), and potassium citrate, but plan to wean off of these.\n\nThe urinogynecologist I had previously seen said the next step would have been cytoscopy and she also refused to do a test of cure or admit that ureaplasma should have been tested.

    "body": "Just wanted to share that I too have effectively \"cured\" my HH by upping my salts, especially Potassium and Magnesium (and some calcium) intake and lowering my Sodium intake.\n\nOne thing to note that differs from the other posts is that I find that natural sourcing of K and Mg are much more effective than supplementing it. I'm talking potatoes, avocado, banana, kiwi, spinach, cantaloupe , etc. I do take a small amount of K and Mg supplements anyway though.\n\nI also refrain from coffee, alchohol, spicy food or using herbs as I find that also increase my HH / anxiety. Fast food, also. I rarely eat out, cook myself, all organic, clean. \n\nI've gone to gym and do full HIIT workouts without my palms and soles sweating. Even if the rest of the body is drenched. The other thing I've noticed as a positive side effect is that by anxiety (especially morning anxiety) has gone down considerably. \n\nNegative effect I've noticed is dark circles under eyes. I'm assuming that's from an increase in the salt intake.\n\nGot a medical checkup recently, from a cardiologist, all systems are good.\n\n\nP.S. - Before the inevitable \"MD\"s and arm chair medical experts (like they do in other threads) jump in, an adult should aim to consume 3,500–4,700 mg of K daily. That's almost 5g. Most of us are defficient in K and Mg anyways. Even if you go over a but (up to 6 grams) it's not a big deal, especially if most of it is from natural sources, but even if you supplement it. No one overdosed eating baked potatoes or spinach and avacados. I've consulted with my doc. So please stop fear mongering to feel self-important.  You'd need about  5.5 mEq/L of serium potassium levels before it becomes dangerous. That equates to around 30 GRAMS of Potassium Citrate supplement in an average healthy adult. Far below the 5g daily recommended intake.",

Uric acid spikes. Constipation too. I bought a softer mattress topper and sleep much better.\n\n**Changed to keto diet and intermittent fasting 20:4**. Eat more vegetables and drink (disgusting) green juices. Take potassium citrate, lemons and ox bile. Drink chamomile infusion and banlangen drinks.\n\nDay 120: 71KG. I also try to lower my ferritin with supplements.\n\nDay 180: 69KG. For now everything seems under control. Blood pressure has lowered to 110-70. I can run 3-6KM/day.

She also has had issues with leg cramps even though it happens much less, but the other day her legs were cramping really severely and she hadn't been working out or doing anything with finals. My son used to get really bad leg cramps and it ended up his potassium was slightly low. He also drank tons of water like my daughter. I dosed her out of desperation with a magnesium glycinate 500mg, potassium citrate 99 MG and naproxen sodium only 200mg a type of ibuprofen. Within an hour and 45 minutes her headache and cramps were completely gone. The doctor ordered blood work and what came back was that her sodium and chloride were low. She also is the low end of normal for potassium and magnesium. She definitely eats plenty of salt.The doctor said that lots of water washes out everything including magnesium and potassium. I don't want to dose her with potassium everyday, and according to the blood work she doesn't necessarily need to be, but if I don't give it to her she will get a migraine. I know that when I was pregnant my iron was on the low normal level and I knew that I needed to take it, because it really affected my blood pressure energy levels etc, so sometimes the low end of normal maybe means you still need it? All I know is the migraines are gone as long as I'm giving her those three things. I hope this helps somebody and it might be why Gatorade and other drinks that have electrolytes help so much for some people. ",

If you are worried that's too much potassium, then you can do:\n\n* Regular Salt (1X, eg 1 Tbsp)\n* Lite Salt (1X, eg 1 Tbsp)\n\n3/4 tsp would be 1100 mg sodium and 300 mg potassium.

Don’t waste your money on Gatorade, pedialite , propel or brands that are similar.

        "body": "I recently have been working with my doctor after an increase of migraine attacks since having covid last year. I also have fibromyalgia and autoimmune arthritis so sometimes I take NSAIDs for that or for migraine or for both. Recently my doc has got me stopping taking NSAIDs and paracetamol for migraine and avoiding them as much as possible, an increasing my use of anti nausea meds and triptans. I was trying to avoid using triptans if it was a mild headache that could be treated by OTC meds alone as there’s a lot of “don’t take triptans too much!” Advice. Unfortunately those of us with migraine are at risk of medication overuse headache, which can happen from OTC meds. My doc got me to stop the OTC meds and go straight to anti nausea and triptans at the first sign of migraine as she suspected I could have been experiencing medication overuse headaches, as well as she explained to me how when we have a migraine attack it stops our stomach emptying properly and in turn stops medications absorbing properly. This was like a lightbulb moment for me personally.\n\nI bring this up as I think when we’re in the uncertainty stages with migraine to accidentally fall into medication overuse headache, as well as the stomach emptying thing I assume has knock on effects to some of the things you’re talking about in the post.\n\nI feel like I have the same problem with electrolytes you have brought up - I would like to talk to my doc about it one day but I don’t want to come off as hypochondriac hahaha. I also am waiting to see how things go on the new protocol she’s got me doing which so far I think it’s working better for me. \n\nI used to be a regular drinker of electrolyte drinks. I take a med for arthritis that is cytotoxic and dehydrating and would take it the day of that once a week med and day after which helped the side effects of that med, but have always suspected I have some sort of chronic electrolyte problem overall. My tolerance for salt is much higher than my partners, and I regularly get unexplained cramps, and often find I still feel thirsty even after having drunk 2 litres of water. \nI’m attempting to up my magnesium intake but have been moving house etc so hard to get new habits in atm! Magnesium definitely helps but I do want to understand more how I personally respond to other electrolytes too",

Very much looking forward to getting below 320 lbs and hitting some new milestones, hopefully water weight above 39% and % body fat into the 43% range. \n\nI have a doctor's appointment on April 19th and estimate I'll be toward the end of a 12 day fast at the time, with weight around 270 lbs. Not thin by anymeans but also not morbidly obese either. \n\nWill be interesting to see what my blood pressure will be. \n\nI'm planning to by a keto/blood glucose kit to track myself at somepoint, probably for my 9 day fast in a few weeks. Want to see just how how my blood ketones get as well as how low my Keto/Glycemic Ratio falls. \n\n3.5 is ideal but if you can get under 1 then you get into some serious cancer fighting territory. \n\nTotal Weight Lost: 30.4 lbs (8.7% of my body weight in 55 days)\nTotal Water Lost: 4.9 lbs (16.1%)\nTotal Bone Lost: 0.4 lbs (1.3%)\nTotal Lean Tissue Lost: 1.7 lbs (5.5%)\nTotal Fat Lost: 23.4 lbs (77.1%)\n\nGoal: 144 lbs (BMI 18.5) and 9.9% or less body fat By Dec 31 2017",

You might know a lot of this stuff already but there also might be some new stuff for you to learn also. Plus when I was starting out last year I never knew when to give oral or IV potassium, or what options were available in general so hopefully this can help with that. Comments/feedbacks/suggestions are welcome!! :)  \n  \n------------\n  \nShould we really be replacing potassium and magnesium all the time? Eh, the evidence isn't great but we usually do it anyways to avoid getting paged constantly. We should probably change that though. Here's some background:  \n​  \nCommon clinical practice suggests replacing K > 4 and Mg > 2, especially in patients at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.\n2000 Practice Guidelines = https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/485434  \n​  \nHowever, evidence for replacing to these goals is very poor.   \nBackground = [Potassium Repletion: Why So Common in Hospitalized Heart Failure Patients?](https://www.medpagetoday.com/resource-centers/focus-hyperkalemia/potassium-repletion-why-so-common-hospitalized-heart-failure-patients/2680)  \nJournal Article = [O'Sullivan et al \\(JAMA Dec 2019\\)   \n](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31339844/)​  \nEvidence shows that extremes (K < 3.5 or > 4.5) are associated with worse outcomes. Not just a random mildly low K of 3.6 or 3.8.  \nJournal Article = [Patel et al \\(Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovascular Care May 2017\\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5410890/)  \n​  \n#Potassium\nGive 10 mEq for every 0.1 you want the potassium to go up.  \nExample: K 3.6 and you want it to be 4.0 = give 40 mEq IV or PO potassium  \nExample: K 3.2 and you want it to be 4.0 = give 40 mEq IV potassium + 40 mEq PO potassium  \nIf patient is severely hypokalemic (K < 3.0), they will need more than 10 mEq per 0.1 increase.  \n​  \n* If patient has AKI or CKD, give LESS potassium to avoid hyperkalemia (probably 50% or less of what you would normally give)!  \n​  \n**Options:**  \n- KCl SR tablet = downside is it is a very large pill and can be hard for patients to swallow  \n- KCl oral liquid = tastes horrible, some patients prefer though  \n- KCl IV = burning is a very common side effect which is intolerable for some patients. You can try giving with lidocaine or piggyback onto maintenance fluids to reduce this effect. Also each 10 mEq equals 50 mL which may be a lot of unwanted volume for patients.  \n- K-Lyte (potassium bicarb and potassium citrate) effervescent tablets = good option to try if patient can't tolerate the regular tablet, comes in 25 mEq and 50 mEq forms  \n​  \nPeripherally you can only give 10 mEq/hr by IV.   \nIf you have central access, you can give up to 20 mEq/hr by IV.  \n​  \n* One reason for refractory hypokalemia = low magnesium. Check their magnesium levels and replace it before giving potassium if this is the case!   \nMagnesium normally inhibits K+ secreting channels in the collecting duct, so if you don't have enough Mg you will start spilling potassium.  \n​  \nSide effects of hypokalemia = muscle weakness, paralysis, arrhythmias  \n​  \n#Magnesium\nEach 1 gm IV magnesium will raise serum level by 0.1.  \n400 gm PO magnesium (the standard dose) is [equivalent](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d1b951_5bf71f0890714bc9bc721dc9fb26ebaa~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_660,h_77,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/Screenshot_29.webp) to about 2 gm IV, though this doesn't account for differences in PO absorption.  \n​  \n**Options**  \n- MgSO4 IV = pretty much the go to method for magnesium replacement. Just consider how much fluid is in each dose.  \n- Magnesium oxide tablets = causes diarrhea frequently which is why it is not preferred. Give if needed though. Common doses you can try are 400 mg x 1, 400 mg daily for 2 days, 400 mg BID for 2 days, etc.  \n​  \nSide effects of hypomagnesemia = muscle cramps (Charley horse), numbness/tingling, arrhythmias, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia (induces resistance to PTH)  \n​  \n#Calcium  \nOften needs correction especially in ICU level patients, as this can affect their respiratory dynamics.  \nRemember to check if the patient is actually hypocalcemic or not by correcting for albumin.   \nCorrected Ca = (4 - albumin) * 0.8 + Ca  \nWe also sometimes check serum ionized Ca levels which bypasses the need for correction entirely  \n​  \n**Options**  \n- Calcium chloride IV = preferred in patients with cardiac arrest, higher concentration (3x more) than calcium gluconate  \n- Calcium gluconate IV = preferred in non-cardiac arrest patients, lower risk of tissue necrosis if fluid extravasates. In general, most studies show calcium gluconate raises serum calcium the same as calcium chloride but with lower risk, just a few studies in critically ill patients showed that calcium chloride was a little faster. Typical dose = 1-2 gm. This should probably be your go to.  \n- Calcium carbonate (Tums) PO = 500mg to 4g/day in 1-3 divided doses  \n- Calcium citrate PO = 200mg to 1g/day in single or divided doses  \n​  \nNice algorithm for treatment on UpToDate = [link](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=ENDO%2F115835&topicKey=ENDO%2F826&source=see_link)  \nBasically, if calcium <7.5 or ionized <0.8, give IV. Otherwise try PO if patient can tolerate.  \n  \n\n*One reason for refractory hypocalcemia = low magnesium. Check magnesium levels and replace!  \n​  \nSide effects of hypocalcemia = perioral numbness (first sign), Trousseau's sign (involuntary hand/arm contraction with checking BP), Chvostek's sign (facial twitching with light touch), bronchospasm, muscle numbness/spasms/tingling, seizures, altered mental status, arrhythmias (prolonged QT common)  \n​  \n#Phosphate  \n  \nLol I don't actually really know how to replace phosphorus that well . . . don't really have to do it that much. For this one, we use mmol instead of mEq to calculate how much to give.  \n​  \nNormal range at UC Davis = 2.4-5.0 mg/dL  \n​  \n**Options**  \n- Potassium + sodium phosphate (K-Phos) tablet PO = use if just mild hypophosphatemia ( > 2.0), side effect is diarrhea if you use too much so if you need high doses just give IV. Just give 1-2 tablets PO TID with meals for a day or two idk.\n- Sodium phosphate IV = probably use this one more than IV potassium phosphate because there's no potassium  \n- Potassium phosphate IV = 21 mEq potassium per 15 mmol phosphate  \n​  \nUpToDate says to weight base dose all this stuff but it seems a little too complicated. I saw this tip on Reddit:  \n​  \n< 2.0 = 15 mmol sodium phos IV over 4 hours  \n< 1.5 = 30 mmol sodium phos IV over 6 hours  \n< 1.0 = 45 mmol sodium phos IV over 8 hours  \n   \nSide effects of hypophosphatemia = basically all the same stuff as above, muscle weakness and cramps, bone pain  \n  \n-----------------------\nVideo if you want some additional details: https://youtu.be/-xX1Sn8vOyA",

I typically pass 1 to 2 stones a year and the last few years they have been increasingly harder to pass(not by pain but in time) i get all the pains associated with it, and know there's something with my left kidney. I just passed a stone last night while having sex which is a first for me but this stone has been bothering me for almost 3 months and when i was examining it, it was rubbery and not hard like my usual calcium oxalate stones I produce. It broke down in my hands with some effort. My stone before this was a 6mm I had lithotrispy and passed. This one they couldn't find at all. But saw my kidney was inflamed about a month ago when I needed some extra pain management. Looking it up I hear something about a matrix stone? I've had smaller white sediment in my previous screenings that would powered up if I tried to collect it I'm wondering if I produce 2 types now and what I can do to help my situation.. \n\nOnto my 3rd urologist, first one retired, second one will only treat active stones and meeting the 3rd today. I've done the 24hr urine test to know I have cal/oxalate stones, I don't eat a whole lot of the foods I'm not supposed to(some things in moderation but not huge on meats nuts and leafy greens) and try to stay hydrated as much as possible. I'm ready to have them put the camera up there and go to town and set myself up with a dietitian and do regular checks to see if im growing anything. I do have a 2mm stone in my right kidney that's been there for years unchanged but it's always the left side that hurts(the sharp pain right below the ribs that comes and goes and still have it after passing whater i did yesterday). I've spent 5months of this past year unable to work since I have a physical job and there's lots of moving around cant even enjoy a day out of town walking and shopping in fear of getting stuck in pain.\n\nAlso has anyone had a doctor claim you didn't have kidney stones while you're trying to get treated in emergency? Had a doctor say i was overweight had bad posture and my balls hurt because I was smoking weed.. 3 days later different hospital diag me with a 6mm stone.\n\nFirst pic is from the stone I broke down last night, didn't get a pic of it together. Second is from 3years ago there's the solid calcium oxalate brown mass and there's some white specs there to. And some others to show extra history of stones. I have more pics that are older showing the small white specs but can't find them lol.\n\nI know I rambled but I'm just tired of dealing with these stones. Who likes dealing with these anyway? Is there any other tests I can request or medication to take? Does potassium citrate or bicarbonate actually help? I've got some fizzy flavoured waters that have potassium citrate listed as an ingredient i drink time to time.\n\nAll recommendations are welcome, if you have any out of the box ideas that you don't want other people to complain about your recommendations send them to me in dm any advice at this point I'll take and I can filter out the stuff that I want from there. Cheers\n\n30yr old male 6' 260lbs, also was 190lbs and still passing kidney stones so weight isn't the issue.",

You only need to avoid meat if you have the liver disorder.  If you have the liver disorder also avoid excess vitamin c, which can convert to oxalate.  \n\nThere’s no dietary oxalate in meat at all.  So it’s worth determining which is the cause of your calcium oxalate stones.  \n\nFor the dietary oxalate diet- not all leafy greens are bad.  Like cabbage, iceberg lettuce, butter lettuce are all pretty much oxalate free.  It’s important to go plant by plant to see where your problem areas are.  My biggest sources of oxalate were spinach(high), rhubarb(high), chard(high), beets(high), potatoes(medium), and carrots(medium), raspberries (medium). But check the oxalate content of individual things you eat a lot of.  Check spices you use a lot of too.  Tahini is one source of oxalate that I missed for a long time.  \n\nIt’s a pain to check all the oxalate levels of everything, but it’s not *literally* a pain so I don’t have to tell you how worth it it is.  The Harvard oxalate list is pretty good.\n\nCheck out the book “toxic superfoods” on Amazon.  It’s all about oxalates. \n\nThe other blood or urine  test you can get is the Uric acid test.  That’s for Uric acid type kidney stones, which also cause gout.  You can take gout meds if you have that type in addition to the calcium oxalate type.",

I was going nuts a week ago, experimenting and tracking everything, trying to figure out what food was causing my sudden increase.....only to finally land on something to do with how much water I drink first thing in the morning + Saltstick vitassium caps + my Vyvanse. I managed to go a whole week without any diarrhea when I started just taking a sip of water with my morning Saltstick cap as opposed to drowning it in 6-10 ounces of saltwater + making sure I take it a half hour or so before my Vyvanse. Otherwise, the potassium citrate enhances the stimulant side effects, and I end up a lot more shaky/jittery and with looser bowels.\n\nAnd both those things can be true, but I was also having issues later in the day, and while I guess I'm not totally sure what my upper limit is for how much salt I can drink at one time (eating a lot and drinking some saltwater never seems to cause the problem), I've learned a valuable lesson in taking my Vitassium caps with nothing more than a sip or two. Otherwise the salt brings all the water to the bowel yard and rushes poop along so fast, most of the water lands in the toilet before your body could even think about absorbing it. Or just Google osmotic diarrhea for a more scientific explanation.\n\nJust wanted to share (because at this point, I guess no detail is too intimate) in case anyone else was struggling with this. Oh and PS, if too many electrolytes caused my diarrhea, when exactly is it safe and how to rehydrate now?\n\nEdited to add: I've spent way too long thinking and researching this today, but given that the ORS is even more salt to water than what I consumed, I'm thinking this might have more to do with my Vyvanse. And/or maybe my sodium doesn't absorb first thing in the morning with no glucose? Kinda feeling like I need a med school education to manage this disease🙃",

    "body": "DISCLAIMER: this might now work for ALL forms of hyperhidrosis. But for the majority CHANCES ARE HIGH.  \nDYSAUTONOMIA is a condition caused by genetic mutations and is the ROOT CAUSE of a LARGE part of ALL primary HYPERHIDROSIS.\n\nIf your hyperhidrosis comes with any of the following: anxiety, digestive issues, insomnia, POTS, etc. then it is VERY likely that your underlying condition is Dysautonomia.\n\nSome forms of hyperhidrosis MIGHT NOT come from Dysautonomia.  \nHowever, the majority DOES and for those that do:  \nThere are solutions, that are non-obvious, but that are precisely effective.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm Alex, a dysautonomia & hyperhidrosis patient, and biotech entrepreneur.\n\nFor the past few months I have been working with the 2 leading researchers in the field of Dysautonomia and Hyperhidrosis ; most of their research is unpublished yet.\n\nToday, we’re excited to introduce a new initiative dedicated to tackling dysautonomia and hyperhidrosis at their root cause.\n\nOur mission is to bring real, science-backed solutions to people suffering from these conditions—solutions that address not just the symptoms, but also the underlying mechanisms driving them.\n\n# \n\nWe are a team of scientists and entrepreneurs, advised by:\n\n* **Dr. Malcolm Brock**, co-founder, a clinician and researcher from Johns Hopkins, who has treated countless patients with dysautonomia and hyperhidrosis.\n* **Dr. Frank Bosmans**, co-founder a leading researcher in electrophysiology, specializing among other topics, in the role of ion channels in nervous system function.\n\nThrough years of clinical experience and research, they’ve uncovered critical insights that could revolutionize the way dysautonomia and hyperhidrosis are managed:\n\nThey have identified that these conditions are often linked to genetic mutations in ion channels, specifically Sodium, Calcium and/or Potassium channels.\n\nThese mutations cause the sympathetic nervous system to become hyperexcitable, leading to an overactive stress response. In dysautonomia, this results in symptoms such as shortness of breath, anxiety, insomnia, and poor digestion, while in hyperhidrosis, it triggers excessive sweating, particularly in the hands and feet.\n\nThe mechanism behind this dysfunction lies in the altered electrical signaling of nerve cells, where the faulty ion channels fail to properly regulate nerve excitability. As a result, the body remains in a heightened state of sympathetic dominance, contributing to chronic stress-related symptoms and discomfort.\n\n# \n\nOur approach focuses on **three key stages**, each aimed at providing relief while working toward a long-term solution:\n\n**1. Symptom-Targeted Supplementation**\n\nWe are developing a supplement specifically designed to help manage dysautonomia symptoms by optimizing hydration, nerve function, and overall physiological balance. Our formula includes **Electrolytes and specifically-tailored Amino Acids, as well as a few precise Vitamins & minerals, shown to work together to adress the symptoms of Dysautonomia and Hyperhidrosis.**\n\nThis formulation is based on our research into electrolyte balance, neurotransmitter support, and metabolic optimization to help combat symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, and blood pressure fluctuations.\n\nIn Full transparency, here is the formulation of the supplement:\n\nSodium (Salt) - 1000 mg of Sodium (2-3 g of salt) for fluid retention.  \nPotassium Citrate - 1-2g fluid equilibrium  \nMagnesium Glycinate - 400 mg of elemental magnesium (3g of Mag Glycinate) - Nervous system calming effect.  \n  \nGlucose, 10 grams, to facilitate electrolytes assimilation via glucose transporters.  \nGlycine, 5 grams. Calming amino acids, body temperature regulation.  \nTaurine, 5 grams regulates nervous system activity.  \nZinc picolinate, 30 mg, regulates nerves membrane potential.  \nVitamins Bs (100% daily value of B1, B3, B6 and B12), key for nerve membrane stabilization among other things.  \nLion's mane, ion channel modulator and nervous system adaptogen.\n\nCBDV 100-800mg. Cannabidivarin is different from CBD, it specifically targets the nervous system to reduce the hyperexcitability that is the cause of most forms of hyperhidrosis/dysautonomia. \n\nCan be combined with full spectrum CBD oil. (make sure it's THC-free or low THC if you can't stand THC)\n\n\n\nAll of these ingredients play an important role and I will explain the more detailed scientific rational in my next posts.\n\nPlease try this combination everyday at 6pm for at least a month.  \nIdeally have all the first ingredients 1h before dinner and then the CBDV AFTER dinner to maximize absorption.\n\n**2. Repurposing Existing Medications**  \nOur findings suggest that dysautonomia and hyperhidrosis are often caused by genetic mutations affecting **ion channels** (including Calcium, Sodium and Potassium channels), leading to an overactive sympathetic nervous system. We are actively working to repurpose **off-patent medications** that were found to work wonders for specific patients with specific mutations.\n\nBy bringing these treatments to market with a dysautonomia-specific focus, we hope to provide more effective and accessible options for patients.\n\n**3. Long-Term Vision: Gene Therapy & Diagnostics**  \nUltimately, we aim to build a **genetic mutation database** to enable precise diagnosis and treatment, with the goal of developing **gene therapies** that can address the root cause of dysautonomia at the molecular level. We believe that understanding the unique genetic profiles of individuals will pave the way for truly personalized medicine.\n\n# \n\nWhy we do it: I know how frustrating and isolating it can be to live with dysautonomia and hyperhidrosis—conditions that are often misunderstood and misdiagnosed. Our goal is to provide real solutions based on science, empowering patients with tools to reclaim their lives and feel better.\n\nThis isn’t just another “miracle cure” or fad supplement; we are committed to transparency, clinical validation, and working closely with the dysautonomia community to ensure our solutions meet real needs.\n\n# \n\nWe’d love to hear from you! Your experiences and feedback are invaluable as we refine our products and approach. If you’re interested in:\n\n* **Joining our early testing group**\n* **Learning more about our medication research**\n* **Staying updated on our progress**\n\nDrop a comment below, or DM me to get involved!\n\nWe’re looking forward to making a real impact together. Let’s bring hope and solutions to the dysautonomia and hyperhidrosis community.",

On a standard diet this water may have been simply moved to alternate fat cells.\n\nYou are also breaking down non muscle proteins from sources that are not necessary or unhealthy. Intestinal repaired tissues - pre cancerous masses - skin etc etc and while these aminos may be reused to retain muscle so that you see less muscle loss you need to look at muscle like fat. Muscle protein synthesis and breakdown are both active 24/7 and which is faster or more active decides if muscle increases or decreases but you're still burning up protein all over your body even if you don't notice loss in your skeletal muscle because much of the unneeded breakdown is redistributed there.",

        "body": "I hear you.  My stone problems started in about 2018 to 2019 and for a about a year and half they were a complete mystery to me.  I thought I had an ulcer or a hernia.  I calculate that before my diagnosis as a result of a biggee (which I passed) I had probably passed 4 or 5 small ones.  Shortly after my diagnosis I had a 1.9 cm one surgically removed and while they thought I had smaller ones up there, I was basically good for about another 2 years.  During that time I increased my liquid intake a bit, stopped with the sodas and drank a LOT of lemon juice, which my Doc said would aid in reduction of stone formation.\n\nI was good for about two years and then in 2022 they started dropping again in \"showers\".  My showers follow a regular pattern:  small stone drops from left, I get an initial one to three days of 5-7 pain, but it moves along, I can feel it moving.  It gets past the choke point and I get a one or two day \"truce\" while it's in the bladder, then another day or two to get it out the last tube.  This will usually be followed right away by another, same routine, another 7 to 10 days, sometimes less pain sometimes more.  And this will go on, stone after stone for a month to 6 weeks.  Then I'll get two months stone free, then back again with another shower.\n\nThis happened soooo regularly and sooo frequently in 2022 and 2023 that I kept a standing prescription of toradol and flomax that I tried to use very parsimoniously for only the times when it was really bad.  And because each stone didn't seem to get stuck, and my bleeding wasn't constant, and they all seemed to pass relatively well, we did nothing about it beyond ride the roller-coaster each time.\n\nBut in 2023 it started to get ridiculous and I decided to log everything so I would have real data.  I kept count of **17 stones in 2023** and I lost a full third of the year to stone-crippling catatonia.  That's when I was motivated to re-examine everything.  I found out my city's water is super hard, nearly 5x the content of Ca and Mg carbonates necessary to be considered hard.  It was clogging my plumbing in the bathroom, who knows about my internal plumbing.  So I cut that out, switched to purified minimal hardness bottled water for EVERYTHING taken inside the body.  I dramatically upped my water intake to about 135-150 ounces a day and I used the flavored water enhancers, most of which contain K citrate in them.  My doc didn't prescribe K-citrate, but my sister an MD also with stones did get hers to prescribe for her.  I started taking the OTC Stone stopper pills which are baby dosages of K citrate but they do have some k citrate in there and something is better than nothing.  I also stopped eating the big oxalate rich foods.  I didn't go crazy, just said no to potatoes, spinach and nuts and tried to switch from wheat to corn.\n\n**So far in 2024 NO STONES**.  I know I know... it's only August, but in my old routine I should have passed through TWO stone cycles so far this year and lost 10 - 12 weeks to stones.  100% productive so far.  If I get to a year, I'll really think I've done something.\n\nSo what has done the trick for me?  I dunno.  As a bad scientist I changed about 4 variables at once.  You never want to do that because you don't know which variable worked.  I don't care, I just don't want stones.\n\nIf I had to guess I'd say the Max hydration was most important, the cutting out hard water second, the stone stopper pills a distant third, the oxalate food reduction fourth.\n\nHere's the Fifth thing... the lemon juice which I notice you DO NOT mention.  Where's your lemon juice in your routine?  It was one of the few things my Doc ordered me to do, otherwise he was pretty vague and hands off.  I buy lemon juice in BIG 48 oz jugs and I mix in as much as I can stand to all my flavored waters.  It goes well with orange, lemon and fruit punch flavors.  I'd say on a given day I mix in 10-12 oz of pure lemon juice, far more than the guys who think they're good with a spritz or two.\n\nI think that it was probably the lemon juice that kept my stones little and passable in the years 2022 and 2023, not allowing them to get big or accrete together into whopper stones I couldn't pass.  K citrate also helps them not to form so give your K citrate a chance to act.\n\nAnd tell us more about those 5 stones a year.  Are they like my little baby stones which don't send you to the hospital but pass like mine?  Or are they big ones that require lithotripsy or surgery and send you to the ER.  I hate to say it, but part of being a stoner is just learning to take what you can get, live with what you've got, manage when you can and recognize things may not change.",

Trust me I work outside in 100°f heat every day and drink around 2.5-3 gallons a day and only pee once because it's all sweat out. It's so bad I'm trying to drink as much as I can so I'm always digesting water lol. I've thrown up water a few times from drinking a bit too much and hard work like digging.  So yeah try and get to where you are peeing 4-6 times a day.  Usually this means a big cup before bed and when you wake up.  \n\nCitric acid with any source of oxalates will help break down the oxalates before they can get to your renal tract and help form stones.  Citric acid with any dense source of calcium is also a good idea.  You can also drink other acidic things such as pickle brine (juice), apple cider vinegar etc. \n\nHave a doctor regulate what/if any supplements you are taking.  Excessive vitamins and other supplements don't get absorbed and usually end up in your renal tract to be disposed of.  If you don't urinate enough they just sit there. \n\nMethylation genetic testing can help you better understand how your body processes nutrients and if you are predisposed to having issues processing certain nutrients.  From there your doctor can help you navigate better ways of getting these nutrients.  Anything that goes unprocessed ends up in your renal tract for disposal usually.",

It's easy, inexpensive, and tastes quite decent (way better to me than any commercial products I've tried).\n\nMy recipe:\n\n\\- 16 oz water\n\n\\- heaping 1/4 tsp salt\n\n\\- heaping 1/8 tsp of [potassium citrate powder](https://www.vitacost.com/now-potassium-citrate-pure-powder) (May use [potassium chloride](https://www.vitacost.com/now-potassium-chloride-powder) next time so that I can get more chloride, but they were out of it when I ordered.)\n\n\\- heaping tsp of turbinado sugar or honey (Edited: a heaping tsp was way too sweet for me, so I cut it down to a heaping 1/2 tsp...and later 1/4 tsp...and finally I decided to leave it out entirely unless I've been outside sweating a lot or have diarrhea.)\n\n\\- 1/2 tsp (66.5 mg) [Magnesium Chloride liquid](https://www.vitacost.com/nutricology-magnesium-chloride-liquid), which I add for migraines (You can also use [magnesium citrate powder](https://www.vitacost.com/now-magnesium-citrate-pure-powder), but the stuff clumps up a lot unless you stir it in really slowly.  Edited: I also tried [magnesium bisglycinate](https://www.vitacost.com/now-magnesium-bisglycinate-powder), and it doesn’t clump up and is cheaper than the chloride liquid.  But it tasted like old fish, so no.  I’m sticking with mag chloride.)\n\nEdited to add: Sometimes I include other ingredients, such as Vitamin B-12 drops, vitamin C powder, inulin for fiber, etc.\n\n\\[I'm not specifically hyping brands or online stores, but I recommend **not** buying from Amazon [because so many supplements sold there are counterfeit](https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/avoid-counterfeit-supplements/counterfeit-supplements/).\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The nitty-gritty, nerdy details...**\n\nIf you want the info I used to create my recipe, I primarily worked from [ConsumerLab.com's article on electrolyte replenishment](https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/electrolytes-sports-rehydration/electrolytes/).  It is behind a paywall.  (And, if you buy supplements, well worth the yearly subscription if you can.)  What I don't really understand is how to calculate how much chloride I am getting, so I'm kinda flying by the seat of my pants on that bit.  (Edit: See mystisai's helpful comment, below.)\n\nHere's what the WHO recommends for electrolyte [Oral Rehydration Salts solution](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-FCH-CAH-06.1) to replenish after diarrhea (and what I modeled my recipe on):\n\n\\- 16 oz water\n\n\\- 816 mg sodium\n\n\\- 1091 mg chloride\n\n\\- 369 mg potassium\n\n\\- 6.4 g sugar\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here's what the [Institute of Medicine](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10925/dietary-reference-intakes-for-water-potassium-sodium-chloride-and-sulfate) recommends after exercise (more sugar, less sodium and potassium than WHO recipe):\n\n\\- 16 oz water\n\n\\- 218 to 326 mg Sodium\n\n\\- 37 to 92 mg Potassium\n\n\\- 23-45 g Sugar\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor reference, here what's in 16 oz of CVS generic Pedialyte:\n\n\\- 493 mg sodium (presumably as sodium citrate & sodium acid sulfate)\n\n\\- 587 mg chloride\n\n\\- 373 mg potassium (presumably as potassium citrate and potassium chloride)\n\n\\- 12 g sugar (as dextrose)\n\n\\- 3.73 mg zinc gluconate",

    "body": "Hi guys!\n\nSo, I have been keto-ing for exactly one week now and I'd like to share some stuff! TL;DR though... \n\nI generally have a hard time waking up and I'm usually super groggy. This morning was the first time that I woke up and was ready to go. It was 7:30 am (on a Sunday mind you...) and I didn't go to bed until after midnight yesterday. I woke up, got up, fed the pets and went on a walk with the dog. Now I'm awake and energized enough to consider a little lifting! I've been foggy and fatigued all week, so this makes me very happy and hopeful. \n\nI'm ignoring my scale, because scales are evil, misleading monsters, that don't tell the whole story and are on this planet to sabotage us! \n(Thinking about getting one of those body fat meters. Does anyone have a recommondation for one?)\n\nAlso, I only get hungry if I forget to eat don't eat for hours on end (6 or more). Most of the time, when I think about food, I have no interest in eating. This is a brand new sensation for me and it confuses me a little. When I do eat, I feel full, like really full for a long time. I log everything in MFP to ensure I get all I need. \n\nWhat has made a great difference is to add a teaspoon of potassium citrate to my 32 oz water bottle every time I fill it up. I would definitely stress adding that!\n\nThat's all :) thanks for sharing all your progress, I hope I can send you all some progress pictures soon!! \n\n",

Instead, we're replacing it with Potassium *Bicarbonate*, which has a much more neutral flavor, according to our taste tests. It's also the form of potassium that is most often found in vegetables and other whole foods. Along with our recent switch from Magnesium Citrate to the super fancy Magnesium *Malate*, and from Calcium Citrate to a vegan Calcium *Phosphate* (chemically similar to, but not actually made from, bones), this gives us one of the most optimal electrolyte blends out there. ;)\n\n**And now, we're making it available for you to use!** :D\n\nA lot of DIYers have been asking about an electrolyte blend ever since we came out with [Super Micros](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-micros/), our optimal vitamin and mineral blend, and at long last, it's finally here: [**Super Electrolytes**](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-electrolytes/) :)\n\n$1.00/day for a month's supply, $0.50/day for six months, including shipping. You can read more about it on [the blog](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/july-2017-update/).\n\nYou don't have to be doing DIY to use it, either. You can mix it with water or juice (or even soda) to make your own sports drink! ;)\n\nhttp://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-electrolytes/\n\nEnjoy! :)",

Have been having electrolyte issues with keto for almost a year, but I didn't know what it was and am still figuring it out.  For a long time I thought it was just seasonal allergies or some other problem, because I already (I thought) consumed plenty of salt, potassium and magnesium.  Then I tried to compensate for symptoms by drinking tons of salt water.  However, since I am 73 yo, a female, and weigh somewhere in the neighborhood of 120-125 lbs, I think I added too much salt.  It stopped some of the symptoms but my blood pressure shot up.  So now I'm thinking I need to stop all that extra salt and instead experiment with gradually adding more magnesium.  Or potassium  I was taking 200 mg maagnesium citrate am and pm, and now I just added a third dose.  Although I consume a diet pretty high in potassium rich foods, I am supplementing with one potassium citrate capsule morning and evening, and am going to start adding the third one mid-day.  Maybe I will get some comments here that will help me.\n\nEdit: May have found something.  I've been taking various forms of albuterol (inhaled) for about 40 years. Just discovered -- It causes decrease in potassium levels.  So this will be a signal to me to try increasing potassium gradually.  I'm guessing that I was already low in potassium from the albuterol but when I started keto it triggered lots of problems with the potassium.\n\nUpdate: After much experimentation, what seems to be working is adding 1/8 teaspoon potassium citrate from Bulk Supplements to each refill of my water bottle. Taste is not very noticeable . Not really having to think much about magnesium as we already take magnesium citrate 2, sometimes 3 times a day. What really seems to be helping is supplementing with Taurine 500mg 2X a day. Someone pointed out that people who take albuterol may be deficient in taurine as well as potassium, and, sure enough, it's made a big difference... Feeling better than I have in months.\n\nUpdate #2: currently adding 1/4 teaspoon potassium citrate to 1 pint (2 cups) of drinking water. Went to doctor for unrelated issues and pulse and blood pressure were fine, which was a relief. The medical assistant wrote down that I was supplementing with potassium and no one raised an eyebrow.\n\nUpdate 4 months later. Satisfied with taking 1/4 tsp potassium citrate 2 times a day in my drinking bottle (water). Also find that taking magnesium citrate 200mg 3 X a day works well. Significant decrease in nausea, vertigo. Blood pressure was normal at doctor's office last week. ",

    "body": "Didn't see this posted here, but for those looking for keto option, /u/axcho just sent the following email:\n\nHi everyone,\n\nHappy May! :) In honor of International Worker's Day, I'd like to take the opportunity to plug one of my favorite books of the last few years, Reinventing Organizations. Decentralized, self-organizing businesses really do exist, in industries from manufacturing to healthcare, and this book shows how it can be done. As an idealist who has found myself suddenly running a manufacturing business with a growing team of employees, I find this vision extremely inspiring and I hope that someday this business can have as big an impact of empowerment and liberation through the lives of the people working for it as it does through the products it sells.\n\nAnyway, here are the updates:\n\nNew rice protein that doesn't taste awful!\nBack to next-day shipping, or close to it.\nFree US shipping on orders over $100!\nBimonthly subscriptions now available.\nThe biggest good news is that we've been able to get a better placeholder rice protein that doesn't have the awful burnt taste of the previous one. All the products made in the last month or so have been made with this new rice protein. Phew! :p Still no updates on availability from our preferred supplier, but the worst is over.\n\nPart of the reason we didn't announce this earlier is that we were also a bit backlogged over the past month as well. One of our manufacturing technicians, Justin, had to stop working due to (unrelated) health issues and production slowed as we filled in for him and looked for a replacement. Fortunately, he is recovering and we have hired Julia, who, along with Jamaica, is now cranking out batches at an impressive rate. So we're happy to say that the shipping delays of the last several weeks have been resolved, and we're back to shipping next-day, or close to it!\n\nNow that we're caught up with our backlog, I'm excited to finally introduce something I've wanted to do for a while: free shipping on larger orders. As we've honed our process and seen sales stabilize at a sustainable level, we are finally at a point where we can begin to pass cost-savings back to you, our customers. So, to start with, we are offering free shipping on orders and subscriptions over $100! :D This is only for US orders - unfortunately international shipping is still prohibitively expensive, though international expansion is part of our plan, as soon as we have the volume to make it work, logistically.\n\nAs part of this update, we're adding the option to have your subscription delivered every two months, so that you can consolidate your subscription into a larger order to save on shipping. If you'd like to change your subscription, just tell us in an email and we'll take care of it for you. ;) Or, you're always welcome to cancel your existing subscription and set up a new one yourself.\n\nComing soon:\n\nNew, odor-free vitamin mix just arrived!\nMCT oil powder for Keto Fuel coming in June.\nNew electrolyte mix for better nutrition and taste.\nWe just received our first shipment of our custom vitamin mix from our new supplier, reformulated to be free of the sulfurous odor of the original batch. It was the L-Selenomethionine, the active selenium compound that gives garlic and onions their characteristic odor, and to a lesser extent the particular brand of Choline L-Bitartrate, that caused the smell after all. We're now using the odorless amino acid chelate Selenium Glycinate instead, and a more expensive but relatively odorless Choline L-Bitratrate in this version. You can expect to start receiving product with this new mix over the next few weeks.\n\nMore excitingly, we've just put in an order for a custom MCT oil powder made with Acacia Gum, which we are expecting to receive by the end of May. The plan is to add it to Keto Fuel, at a dosage equivalent to about half a tablespoon of MCT oil per meal, so you'll no longer have to buy and add MCT oil yourself when using Keto Fuel! Even better, this reduces the dusty lightness of the Keto Fuel powder that is so annoying when trying to scoop and pour it. :p And crucially, we've been able to get the costs of this extra ingredient down enough that we won't be raising the price of Keto Fuel at all - it will just be a better product, at the same price. So we're really looking forward to rolling this out in June. :)\n\nAlso, we've just finished lining up the last suppliers for our electrolyte upgrade, and will be getting our hands on these new ingredients by the end of the month if all goes well. We've found that the electrolyte Potassium Citrate is responsible for the majority of the unpleasant flavors in our products, especially the potassium-heavy Keto Fuel, and we are cautiously optimistic about the opportunity we have here to significantly improve the taste with a few formula tweaks. So, we'll keep you posted on that - and if you want to help out with taste-testing, definitely let us know. ;)\n\nLast but not least, thanks for your help with our branding survey in February! We've been glad to hear that the qualities that we've been most proud of, in terms of our product and service, are the same qualities that you notice and appreciate. However, it's also clear that neither \"Schmilk\" nor \"Super Body Fuel\" do a good job of expressing that brand identity. So we're going back to the drawing board as far as articulating our brand and coming up with a name and visual identity that will really speak to what is unique about us. Stay tuned! ;)\n\nThanks again for sticking with us!\n\nAlex Cho Snyder (axcho)",

    "body": "Hey, so I seriously cannot do this anymore!!!!!!! YAY!!! \n\nAs the title states, I have a pretty complex case and am barely hanging in there. I don’t have very many excellent treatment options. I’m in luteal right now, and it’s a bad one, so I scheduled an appointment to talk with my advanced gynecology team about medical management options for endometriosis and PMDD. \n\nSo, I’m thinking about what I want to say to them, given my myriad issues detailed below. \n\nThe combined pill was horrible for me. I had spotting/a very light period during the third week of my hormonal pills, and then nothing on the sugar pill week. It gave me awful acne and caused weight gain. And it just made my whole month feel like one long PMDD luteal phase. Also, I have migraines with aura (likely due to EDS), so this is off the table as an option.\n\nA POP, in theory, sounds great. But my EDS flares during luteal when progesterone is high, and I’m in pain left, right, and center. Also, I have a very high DHEA level and high DHEA-S and struggle with hirsutism, cystic body acne, and androgenic hair loss, all of which is getting worse. I’d prefer to avoid any progestins that have a high androgenic potential, like norethindrone.  \n\nDrosperinone isn't androgenic, but my urologist prescribed me potassium citrate to correct a metabolic abnormality that causes kidney stones to form, so I shouldn’t be taking something like Slynd. The combination can cause too much potassium in your blood. \n\nI’d prefer not to use an IUD. My specialists are concerned I might have vEDS, and there’s a risk of uterine rupture with an IUD. I have an appointment scheduled with cardiogenetics for testing and counseling in July, so I’m hoping to rule that out soon. Whether I have vEDS or not, and it might be an autistic thing, but I really don’t want anything implanted in me, whether in my uterus or my arm. Plus, all of these options are progestins, so again, I would like to avoid them for the EDS flares. \n\nChemical menopause is looking like my best option right now to manage my endometriosis and treat my PMDD. PMDD is the most disabling condition I have and I cannot live like this anymore. I’m asymptomatic only about a week of the month, so I'm never able to live a life I like. Between the EDS flaring, the severe SSRI-resistant PMDD, and endo pain crushing my legs and bowels, luteal fucking sucks every single month. And then my Vyvanse doesn’t even work as well on top of it all!!!! I think I’d much prefer HRT where I can control a steady amount of the right hormones that don’t leave me with only 9 days of functionality. \n\nI’m only 29, so I feel hesitant to go all-in asking to start Orilissa or Lupron, and really fear they’ll want to put me on a POP first, which I’ll of course do if I have to jump through the hoops to eventually get relief. \n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who also has a complex case or who has tried chemical menopause for their symptoms. Am I being bullheaded in thinking that might be my best option for being able to have a life, maybe for the first time in my life?",

I worry about possible vEDS. I'm on the fence about whether to seek diagnosis for endo or not, because I don't have pain from it but if I do have it, it's snaked it's way all over and is, perhaps, choking my bowels. Oh, also migraine with aura. And they're 50/50 sinus/hormone related so when the pressure is good and steady I'll have 1 or 2 migraines a month from hormones alone.\n\nI'll be 100% honest with you about how I manage my life and my health, which at 41, is somewhat manageable. \n\nI take supplements that focus on managing my blood sugar to target pcos (inositol 4g a day and berberine w milk thistle 500mg at meals), I take supplements that focus on my mood and energy levels, mostly for pmdd and perimenopause that is a roller coaster- 5htp, rhodiola, schizandra, ashwagandha when necessary, and evening primrose oil. The first 2 I have on a rotation every few months I swap them. I also take a vast amount of krill oil for essential fatty acids and my BP (which was always low but ever increasing with age and has been borderline high) went down 10 points. I have also been taking a quality turmeric supplement for decades to help inflammation etc.\n\nMy mental health meds: 300mg wellbutrin xl. This provides a baseline from which my adhd meds can work without giving me peaks and valleys. 10mg adderall IR 4x day (this is for no peaks and valleys as well, I control my dose based on how I feel).\n\nAnd, finally, for the chronic pain: kratom. Kratom saved my life and got me off an ever increasing dose of tramadol, that I became addicted to I was ordering it illegally from India. Kratom works. In 15+ years, my daily dose has remained low and steady (with occasional days I will need more or less) and I have no noticeable side effects aside from constipation which I was basically born with and is probably a food allergy. I brew it as tea, or add a scoop of powder to my coffee and go about my day. It doesn't fuck me up, it never has, it simply relieves about 60-70% of my pain  and lifts my mood. I buy it from a legitimate vetted vendor. And at this stage in the game, it must be said, I cannot live without it. It is as crucial to my functioning as my wellbutrin or my adderall, the latter I've taken for half my life.\n\nSo, this is how I manage. It's a snapshot. I keep the supplements mostly rotating aside from 2 or 3 which are daily, so it's not awfully expensive. I also buy most from Swanson which is a decent generic brand. A few I splurge on quality and buy Gaia herbs brand because they're liquid capsules and super concentrated and easier to digest. \n\nI need to focus more on exercise but when one is constantly battling fatigue and burn out, it's hard af. I also need to be better about eliminating gluten and dairy because when I did that for 6 months I swear I was a brand new human, but the effort and self control required is exhausting too.\n\nGood luck to you. I'm sorry if my diy approach to daily life isn't what you're looking for, but after 20+ years of living with all the conditions, this is finally what is working for me. Also I'll just mention here that I didn't start taking any supplement (aside from turmeric) until my 30s. And also doing the pcos supplements made me fertile so be wary of that. I had 2 pregnancies.",

    "body": "We're delighted to announce that as of today [KetoSoy](http://www.ketosoy.com) is on version 0.9.1\n\nVersion 0.9.1 solves two of the largest flavor complaints that we've received to date: \"It's metallic-bitter\" and it's \"a bad kind of earthy-musky\".\n\n* We are switching potassium chloride out and replacing it with potassium citrate.  Potassium chloride has a different taste based on each person's genetics, but it ranges from slightly salty slightly bitter to heavily salty, deeply metalic, and very bitter.  Potassium citrate does not have these complaints.\n* We are switching to only using Choline l-bitartrate.  Previously we used a mix of both L and DL.  The DL enantiomer has a musky fishy sent.  Because we used a very small amount, most people were not able to detect it as a flavor.  However, a small number of people complained about the muskiness.\n\nThe tester response to version 0.9.1 has been unanimous -- it is an improvement.  Some of our testers reported that 0.9.1 was slightly better.  Others have said it is a category changer -- \"This one tastes good, that one was horrible.\"  \n\nIf you'd like to give version 0.9.1 a try, the coupon code **[TRY-9-1](http://www.ketosoy.com)** will get you $10 off any order of the new version.  With the discount a one-day three-meal sample is just $5 plus shipping.\n\nWe have a few boxes of 0.9 still available, they will be available on the website at a discount until they are gone.   \n\nThe path to 1.0 and beyond\n\nWe've got a few things left to solve before we are comfortable calling KetoSoy version 1.0.  Namely:\n\n* Many people still find KetoSoy too gritty.  If you're in this camp, for now try add 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon of powdered psyllium husk to each meal.  Psyllium husk forms a gel around the coconut flour, coating the rough edges and making it feel smooth in your mouth.  We're exploring adding psyllium husk to the blend, but it is a temperamental ingredient -- too much and the shake turns into a blob of gel, so we have to be careful to balance the psyllium with the other texturing gels and emulsifiers (soy lecithin, xanthan gum, guar gum).  Our early experiments with this are going well.\n* We're also exploring buying machinery to separate out the too-large particles.  It seems 200 microns is the limit for where the shake starts to have a gritty mouth feel.  We're talking with manufacturers of separating machinery to see if there is a model we can afford that can be installed into our current production space.  \n* Adding the Vitamins to the powder.  when we first came out with KetoSoy we thought separate vitamins would be a great way to allow customers to eat more or fewer calories without compromising nutrition.  However, the way our customers are using the shake is not quite like that.  People wanting to adjust calories are adding ore or less oil so we can put the vitamins in the powder and it will still be nutritionally complete.  After learning this we started the process of sourcing vitamin powder.  However, finding a vitamin powder that is sufficiently bio-available, affordable, and neutral in flavor has not been as easy as we had hoped.  We've tried a few so far and so far none have been palatable without pre-sweetening the shake,  and some of them were not palatable regardless of how much sweetener we added.  Since many people in Keto try to limit sweet in their diet as much as possible to prevent cravings we aren't willing to use a vitamin mix unless we can find one that tastes acceptable with the drink unsweetened.  We're working on it, and a solution exists.  We just need to find it.\n\nBeyond 1.0 the primary things we're working on are getting new flavor-protein combos ready (Vanilla Soy is the next) and getting distribution in Canada and Europe for our customers there who currently have to pay too much in shipping.\n\nThank you to all of our customers who send us feedback on how to improve and who share their amazing stories. \n\nMalden, Ma.  November 20, 2015.\n\nFull release here including our roadmap to version 1.0:  http://www.ketosoy.com/blogs/news/69162693-ketosoy-is-now-v0-9-1-better-flavor-same-nutrition\n\nIn case you missed it, the coupon code **[TRY-9-1](http://www.ketosoy.com)** will get you $10 off any order of the new version.  With the discount a one-day three-meal sample is just $5 plus shipping.",

Was going to give this and Ketochow a try but if you're like me and live in Canada, this is closest to the cheapest and most convenient option available. Buying 15 day packs with shipping comes up to 18.7 CAD/day considering Ketosoy has no extras, while the only other real competitor for Canada at least, the cost of heavy cream, MCT oil, fish oil, protein powder and the raw ketochow + shipping etc comes up to about 15.3 daily. I'd rather save myself the effort of having measure and mix oils, cream, protein powder, etc. and pay the extra 3.5$ to KetoSoy. Note that the prices i used were based on the cheapest possible options + subscription discounts on both sites. If you go for the premium ketochow flavors, they'd probably end up being the same price as Ketosoy. \n\nTL;DR, KetoSoy isn't really more expensive compared to Ketochow. In Canadian dollars \nKetosoy - 18.75$ Day + Everything provided. \nKetochow - 17.4$ Day Basic Flavor or 20$ Day Premium flavor Including cost of the Fish Oil, Heavy Cream and MCT Oil you need to gather + mix yourself. Alternatively, if you opt to get Raw Ketochow and supply your own protein powder, it downs to 15.5$ a day, but no flavor, lots of work and just not worthwhile in my opinion. \n\nHope this information helps anyone else make an informed decision :) I'm in Toronto, so all the figures are in CAD.",

    "body": " \n\nI rarely post on Reddit, however, I wanted to share my journey on finally fixing my digestion.\n\n**Problems**:\n\n1. Chronic constipation since childhood, gas, and bloating.\n2. Frequent urination.\n\n**Background**: Vegetarian for most of my life, having copious amounts of carbs including fiber every day. Lost 20-30 pounds several times through diet manipulation and working out; one time even got ripped but gained at least 50% of weight back due to poor lifestyle choices. Researching weight training and nutrition for 5+ years. Pretty accurate in tracking calories, macros, etc., and have basic nutrition knowledge.\n\nNote: My father has the same issues of constipation and indigestion.\n\nMy whole life I was led to believe, the more fiber I have, the better my digestion would be. I tried multiple ways to incorporate it. Balancing soluble and insoluble fiber, taking supplements, and having different fiber-rich foods were some of the ways. It worked for some days, but then I get constipated again. Eating beans and vegetables was a nightmare. Since I came from a culture where wheat, beans, and vegetables are the primary sources of diet, my digestion was always terrible. It's hard to describe in words how awful it feels to have poor digestion and be constipated every day. I consumed all the youtube fitness information I could, everyone said to eat more fiber and so I did, but my condition deteriorated. I always thought keto was a fad diet, so I never imagined I would do carnivore. In addition, I was mostly a vegetarian so I was not that comfortable eating that much meat every day. All that changed when I randomly ended up clicking on a video by Laura Spath, talking about her digestion issues and how they got cured through a carnivore diet.\n\nI researched for 2-3 months on this way of eating. Finally, I decided I would try it for 30 days, but I would ease into it. I am a student so all I could afford was ground beef patties from Walmart. The first week, I had ground beef, hamburger buns, and oranges. I made sure I had my electrolytes balanced. I seasoned my meat with table salt. I made my own electrolyte blend with Redmond sea salt, Potassium citrate, and magnesium glycinate. Within 2-3 days, my frequent urination problem resolved, indicating it was an electrolyte issue. During the first week, my bowel movements became a little better, however, in the end, I started having the infamous carnivore diarrhea. It lasted for 2-3 days and stopped when I incorporated a little cheese and stopped having rendered fat. The second week, I only had ground beef and some cheese. One day I incorporated pork rinds but it upset my stomach. In the second week, I had loose stools but not diarrhea. I was not constipated. I ordered keto strips to check if I was in ketosis multiple times a day. I was in ketosis in the second week. The results in the second week were that my teeth started getting whiter, loose stool but had no constipation, better constant energy, and better sleep.\n\nThings were not too crazy. I knew I was on the right path. However, there were 2 issues. The first was I started having heart palpations, and they were getting worse. I thought heart palpations generally happened because of electrolyte issues but now I didn't know why they were happening. The second issue was, eating beef every day. As already discussed, I come from a vegetarian way of eating. This way of eating become extremely difficult for me and I admitted defeat. Just the taste of beef without hamburger buns or maybe rice was way too strange for me.\n\nAll this time, in addition to researching the carnivore diet, I was also listening to Stan Efferding and his way of primarily focusing on meat and rice. Then, fulfilling your remaining micronutrients through other food sources. After the carnivore diet, I was not ready to go back to the vegetarian way of eating. So I kept, meat as my primary food source.\n\n**What happened next was nothing more than a miracle. All I am having now is :**\n\nWhole milk boiled (organic)  \nRaw honey  \nGhee  \nEggs  \nPeeled almonds soaked overnight in water  \n1 orange and 1 apple  \nChicken as my staple meat and red meat sometimes  \nRice  \nElectrolytes\n\nMy constipation has gone. My restroom time is reduced from 30 minutes multiple times a day to 5 minutes just once in the morning. \n\n**Reasons for choosing these foods:**\n\nPotassium is known for helping constipation. However, on the days I skip electrolytes, I don't have a problem the next day. So, I don't know what's really going on with potassium but I take it just in case.\n\nMeat, Milk, Ghee, and Eggs: Primary drivers for reducing constipation. My body loves saturated fat. I boil the milk as in my culture, milk was always boiled before serving.\n\nOrange and Apple: Fiber. I don't know if fiber is required on not for digestion. However, I have **heard** fiber is important for clearing dietary cholesterol from the body which possibly keeps LDL low.\n\nRice: Easy to digest.\n\nAlmonds: I have heard soaking almonds reduces phytic acid in them. Again, in my culture, almonds were always soaked overnight before serving.\n\nHoney: I like the taste honestly. I put honey and almonds in the milk and it tastes amazing.\n\n**Disclaimer: All this is my anecdotal experience.**\n\nMost of my RDA requirements are being fulfilled through this way of eating. I will slowly introduce 5-6 baby carrots and a cup of cooked spinach to complete them.\n\nI just wish the best of luck to everyone. I finally resolved my suffering of 25+ years, it can be done!\n\n**Update**: Trying to find a sustainable way of eating and not just eating one food. Been doing more hit and trials. Found that if I majorly eat eggs and meat(chicken mostly) and be low in fibre, I can eat anything else in moderation and I am fine. Not taking electrolytes now and I am fine.\n\n**Update**: Due to trying out different foods I started getting constipated again. Mostly when I had too much protein or Salad.\nDid more research and found out two reasons: 1. Low Stomach Acid 2. Inadequate Potassium \n\nStarted taking betaine HCL and Coconut water.\nThings are better now. \nMy Rumination Syndrome also went away since taking HCL before meals. And I feel uncomfortable if I am just lying on my bed after eating. I am motivated naturally to take a light walk after meals.\n\nStill working on going at the same time everyday( fixing circadian rhythm).\n\nWhat I understand is there are three major tasks someone can do to fix constipation:\n1. Have adequate electrolytes/potassium. Try to avoid excess coffee.\n2. Have adequate stomach acid. One can achieve this by having enough meat in their diet. Or using Apple cider vinegar / Betaine HCL pills before the meal. \nAnd really digest the meals. If we think about it, constipation is happening because food is not being digested. So light walks, being active is a good way to achieve it.\n3. Have your circadian rhythm in order. Your body will know when to go everyday.\n\n**Update**: Able to eat salads again. This is unbelievable. Needs more Betaine HCL to digest salad though. Still trying to fix circadian rhythm which is much more important than people think. Constipation fixing factors: \n1. Adequate Stomach Acid (most important)\n2. Circadian rhythm (It does matters)\n3. Saturated Fat\n4. Potassium\n5. Fiber (with adequate stomach acid it helps, without it makes constipation worse)\n\n**Update**: Stopped taking Betaine HCL. My foreskin started having burning sensations and pain (yikes!). Although, I think it’s my fault as I was taking like 4 pills with salads. The burning is gone now.\nAmazing part is even though I stopped taking HCL, still digestion is good.\nThe only thing is I am pooping multiple times a day, I think it would be resolved once my circadian rhythm gets fixed.\nLesson that I learnt is that use carnivore/meat based diets/fasting/Betaine HCL/ACV to just get the acidity right and then wean it off.\nOnce the body gets that momentum going, there is no need to keep doing those things.\n",

Have been reading so much and listening to laura path and so many carnivore supporters on Youtube. Since last month, I started pure carnivore. In the beginning, I had such miraculous results. First time, I had no stomach bloats. no feeling of this stuck thing and going to toilet so many times in a day.\n\nbut around 3 weeks, the symptoms coming again. also poo smells bad. so I introduced strawberries and blue berries. Michael kummar says he cure ibs with meat centric diet and a few berries. But still having problem. \n\nI have also started eric berg's 2 tablets of betaine hydrochloride with it plus his electrolyte. I still can't seem to resolve. \n\nmy stomach symptoms are much better than high fibre diet of course. But it was even better than pure carnivore ...though not perfect with rice at lunch with bottle gourd vegetables. \n\nI got blood tests last sunday. MY fasting insulin came at 44 ...while the okay range is 5 to 24. so I am afraid to introduce potatao and rice. \n\nI am now confused between fibre and no fibre thing with constipation. Or is it dyssernic defecation issues and won't resolve with anything completely.\n\nOr did I start bad as I started having just two meals on meat..and that resulted in disturbing my thyroid...as all thyroid blood test results were off last week. dr boz said, if we do intermittent fasting and less fat in the beginning it shuts out metabolism and cause much more issues. I have also got too thin,,feel like I have muscle loss now.\n\nSo I am literally confused now..I would love you to tell me your exact health status now, what are you exactly eating now and what suplements,and Are you okay?\n\nI am from india.",

    "body": "Hi all! Thought I would provide my story on how I was able to lower the risk of kidney stone formation significantly. My last stone was more than 5 years ago (fall of 2019). I used to get them about once every 1-1.5 years. I've had about 7 in my life. I once had one in each kidney. I was always able to pass them, except for the last one. \n\nBack in fall of 2020, I started seeing a kidney specialist (Nephrologist), and they provided me with insight on how to lower the risk of developing future kidney stones. They previously did work for those at high risk of kidney stone formation at a young age. It involved diet changes, potassium citrate supplements, hydrochlorothiazide for calcium levels and not blood pressure, and vitamin D supplement. My serum potassium citrate was extremely low at first. Since starting this lifestyle change back in fall of 2020, my risk for kidney stone formation has lowered to near 0%, and the chemical makeup of my urine has returned to that of a normal human. If you are able to, I would recommend seeing a Urologist or Nephrologist to see if there is a way you can manage the risk of kidney stone formation. Of course, there are different types of stones, so it may differ from case to case. But, ever since starting this, I have not regretted it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!",

    "body": "There’s so many ways to skin an orange, but how do you prepare for days of dance in the Tennessee heat?\n\nI’ve been searching high and low for reccomendations from the years past years and here’s some of the best:\n\n“Here's my game plan and kind of my reccomendations.\nI think this kind of thing would help with most folks our age in our twenties and thirties.\nFrom now until June, I'm doing a ton of running. I'm going to run a 10K race on Memorial Day, which is a good goal to be in shape by. I'm going to keep doing runs a few miles at a time until about a week before Roo, and then pair it down to a few of just a mile up until that weekend.\nAbout two weeks before Roo, I'm going to force myself to go to bed early most of the time and get an absolute minimum of eight hours a night. The weekend before Roo, I'm going to pull a few late nighters to kind of get in the swing of that, sleep a lot again on Sunday and Monday, and then stay up pretty late again either Tuesday or Wednesday to get in the habit.\nAlso super important, eat healthy in the few weeks leading Bonnaroo. Lots of water instead of tea and Coke, don't go for greasy stuff, go for a sip of wine over a glass of beer, things like that. It pays off big time to kind of have a clean system.”\n_______________________\n\n“Drink water. Seriously, always be drinking water. I go through at least 8-10 bottles a day, and that's on top of constantly refilling my camelbak. You would be surprised at how many people say \"oh yea, im drin plenty of water\" but are still under-hydrated. If you aren't pissing clear you're going to have a bad time.\nAnd also to echo what everyone else has said, do a lot of jogging/walking the months leading up to Roo. This is another one I feel a lot of people underestimate.\nDepending on where you camp, you could be walking\n10-12 miles a day, on top of standing in place during shows which could be 1-3 hours.\nBonnaroo is an amazing place, but its also one of the most physically demanding things you can do to your body. Its only compounded if you add [redacted].”\n_______________________\n\n“Good shoes and SOAKING YOUR FEET DAILY....bring a bucket and maybe some epsom salts.”\n\n_______________________\n\n“Def recommend to go to a few shows before Roo - get in game shape!!The gym is obviously a great resource but you don't jump up and down on the tread mill, you dont dance side to side. You want to build those muscles too\nedit: Theragun - get a massage gun and use that sumbitch every friggin day. I woke up and used it, used it after a meal, used it before going to a set, used it when i took a break at camp and again when i got back.\nIt was awesome getting in little massages, working out the kinks and then letting my legs rest a bit in between all the madness”\n\nNot mentioned above:\n- Aclimatize to heat prior\n- Yoga\n- And perhaps most importantly, Electrolytes\n\nLiquid IV is crazy expensive but very practical for many uses, partying especially. Over hydrating without proper electrolytes can be as dangerous getting dehydrated. In the hopes of making hydration accessible, I’ve developed my own. \n_______________________\n\nNow liquid IV’s recipe is secret but here’s an approximation of it (this is the 1/5th batch i use for testing new flavors, produces ~20 servings, at ~.50 cents per serving):\n\n- 25.5g Salt\n- 20.36g Potassium Citrate\n- 100g Sugar\n- 120g Dextrose Powder\n- 10g Citric Ac!d\n- 1.5g Pure Stevia\n- 2x packs of Koolaid (2qt packs)\n\nServing Size: 14g/20oz water (about 1 heaping tablespoon per regular size water bottle)\n\nNow people have different needs when it comes to what they sweat out. This is a good base electrolyte mix. \n\nIf you feel the need to be more exact. There’s several at home sweat tests available (cheapest from gatorade but is not the easiest to use). Mine revealed i lose more sodium than some so i add 7g of salt to the above recipe. \n\nI also like it sweeter so I up the amount of stevia to 2.5g. \n\nThe only ingredient you CANNOT increase is the potassium citrate. Having too much potassium is very bad for your blood pressure and can cause serious illness. \n_______________________\n\nAm I missing anything? Should i get in a couple benders beforehand? Playing tennis in the heat of the day? Let me know how you’re getting ready!\n\n\n",

And unless you are willing to buy it in 50 lb quantities, it becomes hard to beat commercial electrolyte packets, especially if you consider the cost of ziploc baggies and time.\n\nHomemade uses potassium citrate, salt, dextrose*. Could add citric acid for negligible cost. *bought in 10 lb quantities for ~$40.\n\nHere's the details:\n\n* Pedialyte, ~$7 per liter - $420/mo at 2L/day\n* Normalyte, $1.7 per liter - $101/mo at 2L/day (subscription rate + DYSAUTO30 code)\n* Trioral, $0.40 per liter - $24/mo at 2L/day\n* Homemade with 13.5g dextrose/L, $0.21/L - $13/mo at 2L/day\n\nIt can get cheaper if buying ingredients in massive quantities. I did the calculations based on what you'd find sold as supplements for potassium citrate, and I also used a more expensive salt (that I have around the house).\n\nIf you redo the calculations using locally purchased (e.g. not including shipping) ingredients in bulk: 25 lb Morton salt, 50 lb food grade potassium citrate, and 50 lb dextrose, you can get the following cost:\n\n* Homemade from extreme bulk quantity ingredients with 13.5g dextrose/L, $0.08/L - $5/mo at 2L/day\n\nBut that's 15.75 years worth of salt, 11.25 years worth of potassium citrate, and 1.25 years worth of dextrose at 2L/day.",

Long story short, the vet told me it had passed and her X-rays were clear. She was prescribed the medication mentioned to take 2x daily “for life.” I just received it over the weekend and have noticed possible side effects—diarrhea—and she, quite frankly, doesn’t look good this morning. Her tummy upset is pretty bad.\n\nDoes anyone else have bad experiences with this medication? What did you do? Is there something I should incorporate more into her diet? I’ll be calling the vet later today also.",

        "body": "I’m not a doctor or vet, but a chemist. Potassium Citrate should be no problem. It’s kinda regulator and exchange it’s Potassium part in its molecule with calcium what helps to flush out the excess of calcium (because pure Calcium or Calcium Oxide is hardly soluble in water, others molecules with calcium like the Citrate are more soluble). Internet says Guinness pigs absorb more calcium than needed from their nutrition so it’s good if your Guinea pigs diet contain enough water or fresh greens with enough water and a pure water source (some piggies don’t like their bottles but they need fresh water) and use less dry food if you’re using it.\nAbout the other medication…I’m not sure what’s the benefit of using it till piggies end. Hydrochlorothiazide helps your pig with getting rid of bladder stones. But the side effects speak for theirselves. Is it better to have diarrhoea for the rest of your life than risking another bladder stone? Like I said I’m not a vet or doc, but the best thing can happen to pharmacy is that you have to take a medication for the rest of your life (=💵💵💵). At least when it’s about humans. I like to think that vets are not like that but you never know. \n\nIt’s good that you questioning this kind of threat. Maybe he’s right but it’s like with humans. If I feel something sounds strange or not comprehensible I’ll go to ask a second doctor (or vet in your Situation). \n\nAnd yeah like already said I’m not expert so do your researches and look what’s the best for your pig. I’m excited if others have interesting experiences to this topic. \n\nGood luck with your piggie!",

    "body": "Lets start with loose skin. The skin is composed of water, protein, and fat. The most commonly known proteins in the skin are collagen and keratin. Now lets break that down a little more into minerals mainly Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen and Oxygen with small amounts of Phosphorous Iron, Sodium, Magnesium, Sulphur, Calcium and Chlorine and traces of many others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow just that alone it would seem very strange for the body not to use that when fasting. If you get to low of a BMI the body will cannibalize your heart and brain. To think you will die with loose skin on you body just seems crazy after my research. We can glimpse  more from photos of people staving, contraction camps and holocaust survivor. No extra skin on anyone. Just bones and VERY tight skin.\nSo you have loose skin? I say fast. Fast long and hard. Now for your body to go after your loose skin you have to remove most of your fat stores. Just my theory and im not a doctor, but if you healthy and dont want to go under the knife. Try Fasting. For a weeks or two then test your results.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince I been around I seen many post about exercise and fasting. Let me start with this if you over 22-25 bmi. TRAIN HARD. Really give it everything you got. As long as your semi healthy and control you sodium levels. GO HARD. I been doing 4-8 miles and weight training every other days for the last 6 days. I on my 6 day of fasting. I done a few long fast over 5 days now but this was the first time I trained like I was eating. Training and fasting is not all that bad at all really most of the time it feels easier. Now if you cant seem to keep doing both choose fasting over working out. Its not all or nothing here. Do what you can, but if your like me and have lots of fat store you can give it all you got.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGHT!!!** Make sure you got you Sodium in check. Working out you want to up your sodium 500 or more mg. Go by how you feel. Feeling good keep going. Feeling bad slow down and drink some sodium water. Also i wouldn't drink plain water at all. Every ounce of water you consume should have at least some sodium in it. If you feel sick or ill odds are sodium or potassium. If all else fells eat a small meal low cal, low carb, High protein. Then start you fast again no problem no need to wait. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere my work and progress recipes for my water. Adjust to needs and taste.\n\n- Water: (2 Liters or 2.11 Quartz or 67.62 ounces or 8.45 Cups)\n\n- Sodium: (8.5 grams = 1.791 teaspoons)\n\n- Potassium Citrate Powder:  (8.5 grams = 1.791 teaspoons)\n\n- Apple cider vinegar: (1/4 tsp)\n\n- Baking soda: (1/4 tsp)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo fast long and train hard. Hope this helps you out because it done wonders for me. Just my theory. Post your results let us know. One way or the other. Best regards!",

    "body": "First some background:\n\nI just turned 31, am healthy and in pretty good shape (6'1,180lb.), work out semi-regularly, and have a penchant for over-eating delicious food and drinking vast quantities of beer.  Ummm beer. \n\nIt all started in late April in the lead-up to my birthday when my fiance and I celebrated for the entire week eating rich food and drinking far too much with neighbors and friends.  On the evening of my birthday, a good amount of us went out for all-you-can-eat sushi (Sushi Hunter in North Beach San Francisco - highly recommended for an AYCE sushi joint) AND all-you-can-drink sake.  Needless to say, a ludicrous amount of sushi was eaten and sake drunk, with a few 22 oz. Sapporos mixed in for good measure.  Luckily, our apartment is close by and we stumbled/waddled home without incident.\n\nThe next day, the joint in my left big toe was a bit sore which I attributed to walking around a bunch the previous day and likely hurting it in some fashion on the drunken walk home the night before.  I didn't think much of it as it didn't hurt too badly and just felt a little out of whack when walking.  To take the edge off, I proceeded to drink a 6 oz. flask of Rye while watching the Giants game on the telly, which in retrospect, was EXACTLY like pouring gasoline on a fire. \n\nFast-forward a few hours later to around 3 AM when I got a rude awakening from some invisible, marauding devil repeatedly jamming a sharp, barbed, red-hot, pain-poker directly into my big toe joint without letting up.  I seriously thought my foot was somehow broken as the pain was FUCKING INCREDIBLE and the entire top half of my foot was grotesquely red and swollen.  A surprising amount of heat emanated from the spot as well which I found to be curious/disconcerting.  A self-diagnosis of gout/podagra was quickly ascertained as my symptoms fit pretty neatly into various Google searches on the subject.\n\nTo make a long story short, I have NEVER experienced pain of this intensity in my life - I am completely sympathetic to those suffering from the same condition who contemplate cutting their foot off just to be done with it.  Luckily, I have an understanding neighbor who took pity on me and gave me a month's worth of Vicodin and Percocets left over from a recent shoulder surgery.  The opiates, coupled with obscene quantities of Advil (started calling them my M&M's), made the pain bearable during the day and allowed me to fitfully sleep at night.  After resisting for 3 weeks with slowly diminishing symptoms, I finally went to a doctor who said it was generally uncommon for gout to persist that long and proceeded to give me a 5-day course of prednisone as treatment.\n\nThat seemed to do the trick as the swelling started to decrease the next day and the pain became more tolerable allowing me to get off the pills, which was a good thing since I was close to running out at that point.  3 weeks later, I'm about 95% healed, finally off the crutch/cane, and walk without a noticeable limp.  My foot now looks nearly identical to my other, non-afflicted foot, but with a bit of red bump sticking out from the side of my afflicted joint.  The pain has subsided completely while at rest and now only twinges a bit while walking - completely acceptable compared to the situation just a few weeks prior when I literally had to hop around just to get anywhere.\n\nAnyway, it seems I have survived my first battle with gout with my sanity intact and I wanted to share what I learned from this (horrible) experience:\n\nA)  There is a staggering amount of conflicting/confusing/contradictory information out there on the Internets, especially when it comes to modifying one's diet WHILE suffering an attack.  The only consistent info I could find regarded the general cause of gout - chronic hyperuricemic condition (too much uric acid from either producing too much or excreting too little) leading to a deposit of uric acid crystals in (a) specific joint(s) - usually the big toe.  So, diagnosis and analysis of my condition was relatively straight-forward, especially when considering the factors leading up to my attack - sushi/booze/years of overindulgence.  However, that is where the easy-info path ended and the arduous task of navigating the gout-diet labyrinth began.\n\nAny article or guide to dealing with gout via diet modification begins the same way: Gout is caused by a build-up of uric acid.  Uric acid is formed from compounds called purines that your body may have a hard time excreting.  Here are the foods that are high in purines:  STOP.  This is where the various sites/articles/pamphlets begin to diverge GREATLY in their advice or recommendations.  Websites tied to the Mayo Clinic will diverge from the University of Maryland Medical Center will diverge from the American Medical Association will diverge from LiveStrong will diverge from Goutpal, etc. etc. etc.\n\nThere is overlap on the lists but these instances are rarely consistent.\n\nThe ONLY consistent food/drink that I found on the various banned lists were game meats, red meat, shellfish, and alcohol (with an emphasis on beer sadly).  If one were to avoid ALL of the foods on the various lists, there would literally be NOTHING to eat.  I'm not joking either as nearly EVERYTHING has something negative associated with gout.  This is not hyperbolic in any sense.\n\nFor example, a gout sufferer can eat almonds as they are generally good for you and are very low in purines.  BUT, they are also high in niacin (vitamin B3) which can inhibit uric acid excretion.  Argh.\n\nOr, eat a bunch of berries, especially cherries, as they are high in compounds called anthocyanins, along with other anti-oxidants and flavonoids purported to be good for inflammation and other various ailments.  Pineapple too as it has high amounts of bromelain, another compound good for inflammation. BUT, these foods are high in sugar, especially fructose, which I have found on various sites to be the absolute devil for gout.  Ugh.\n\nOr, eat some tomatoes as they're low in purines and high in Vitamin C, which I have also found on various sites to be helpful.  BUT, they are also very high in oxalates which are generally thought to impact kidney stone sufferers more but MAY also play a role in gout.  FML\n\nThis is THE WORST PART when suffering your first gout attack.  What the hell are you supposed to eat if nearly EVERYTHING is bad for you?  And without a consistent hierarchy of 'badness' to boot!  So glad I had a copious amount of pain-killers at this point....\n\nAdditionally, the merits of various gout diets were suspect as well.  Paleo diet?  Isn't eating a bunch of meat (very high in purines), seeds (high in purines), vegetables (some high in purines like asparagus, avocado, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, etc.), and nuts (high in compounds like niacin that may inhibit UA excretion) bad for gout???\n\nOr conversely, avoid meat altogether and focus on eating mostly starchy foods like pasta, bread, or potatoes?  I can't tell you how many sites I've found telling me THIS was the wrong path to go down. \n\nNeedless to say, the search to compile an acceptable list of foods to consume was MADDENING.  After eating nothing but cereal, milk, carrots, and cherries for the first 4 days, along with salads at night with 'low-purine vegetables', I decided that nobody really knows what the hell they are talking about and gout is far too idiosyncratic a condition to resolve when trying to craft an 'acceptable' diet.\n\nNow, I have no clue if this worked or not as my symptoms didn't really start to subside until I went to the doctor and took some prednisone, but this is the diet I eventually settled on and continue to use to this day:\n\nNo booze of any kind, no meat of any kind.  Lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts regardless of purine/oxalate/niacin/etc. content.  Lots of dairy as well - milk, yogurt, cheese.  Also, I'm generally staying away from wheat (without being crazy about it) and peanuts as these both seem to have inflammation implications. \n\nBasically, I turned into a non-drinking vegetarian which is kind of insane when looking at the previous 15 or so years of eating and drinking whatever I wanted at any time.  So be it - sure beats having the devil come back into my toe and walking around with a cane like a much older man.  However, I'm starting to think about testing the waters again with meat and/or booze albeit with some needed 'moderation'.  Going to have to get used to that word, mod-er-at-ion, as I used to consider it a pejorative term....oh well.\n\n\nB)  There seems to be some correlation between low vitamin D and gout.  The doctor pointed out that I had low vitamin D levels and suggested I take a supplement.  The advice has some merit it seems from a gout perspective:\n\nhttp://goutandyou.com/gout-and-vitamin-d/\n\nInteresting that gout is more prevalent in northern latitudes with attacks more common in the spring (when vitamin D levels are lowest in the population aggregate).\n\nEven if there is no direct link between vitamin D and gout, it still seems to be a pretty crucial vitamin for a number of processes and it's probably not bad to correct for a deficiency if you have one.\n\n\nC)  Breakfast is important.  I used to only have coffee for breakfast and generally wouldn't eat anything until about 2-3 PM every day - don't know why but I have just never been hungry in the mornings.  Unfortunately, this plays right into gout's hand as your body starts to break down muscle for energy and produces ketone bodies and lactic acid as byproducts - these 2 compounds inhibit the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid....you know the rest.  Additionally, 'accidental fasting' as it's called, throws your potassium balance out of whack which has also been implicated in gout occurrence.\n\nD)  Socks while sleeping may help.  It seems that the reason the majority of gout attacks happen at night is due to uric acid coming out of solution in the blood and forming into crystals when your body temperature drops a few degrees - what generally happens to everyone while they are sleeping.  Keeping a pair of socks on at night may help your feet retain a few degrees of heat which may prove crucial for the mitigation of uric acid crystal formation.  Not sure if this actually helps, but the theory seems sound and it probably doesn't hurt.\n\nE)  The various 'cures' I have found to have a bit more merit than others (on my own biased scale).  In no particular order:\n\nCherries (tart are preferable?!?!, black, bing, sweet, extract, juice, pills, all good it seems), Bromelain (found in pineapples), Quercetin, Potassium Citrate, Apple Cider Vinegar (good with maple syrup, others like honey), devil's claw root, cat's claw root, celery seed extract, turmeric, dairy products, vitamin D.\n\nI take nearly all of these now and also drink a bunch of water on a daily basis.\n\nF)  Gout sucks (an understatement to say the least) but it does get better.  To everyone losing hope that they'll never walk normally again - don't worry.  It might take some time but eventually your attack will subside and you can start to think about returning to a normal routine, albeit with some needed modifications.  A gout attack is a wake-up call that something is seriously out of whack with your body.  The sooner that you recognize this and take some basic steps to correct for the problem, the better you will be in the long run.  Also, I found a few studies linking elevated uric acid levels to lower risk for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease - so I guess there is a silver lining here!?!?\n\nI'm probably forgetting a few things but I hope everyone who has read this far found some nugget of info that has proved helpful.

    "body": "Product page: [https://theordinary.com/en-us/aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution-exfoliator-100400.html](https://theordinary.com/en-us/aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution-exfoliator-100400.html)\n\nThis peeling solution is the favorite product of mine from The Ordinary. While being quite aggressive it is the only thing that keeps my keratosis pilaris at bay. Even though the Ordinary products are very cheap, the peeling solution is frequently sold out. Also, it comes in small bottle of only 30ml and ends quickly. These are good reasons to dupe it.\n\nThe INCI is not short, but the formula itself could be optimized to be very simple. [Let's break it down](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution-3):\n\n>**Glycolic Acid** - the main exfoliating acid in the formula, I suspect other acids are in trace amounts; **Aqua** - plain water; **Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water** - works as a marketing ingredient. In such highly acidic solution it is useless; **Sodium Hydroxide** - neutralization agent, reacts with acids to reach target pH; **Daucus Carota Sativa Extract** - carrot root extract, gives color; **Propanediol** - humectant and solubilizer; **Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine** - solubilizer for Salicylic Acid; **Salicylic Acid** - the BHA; **Potassium Citrate** - buffering agent to stabilize pH; **Lactic Acid** - AHA, added in trace amount (<1%) to market the product as mix of acids; **Tartaric Acid** - AHA, added in trace amount (<1%) to market the product as mix of acids; **Citric Acid** - AHA, part of buffering system, pH adjuster; **Panthenol** - humectant; **Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer** - thickener; **Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/​Leaf Extract** - gives color; **Glycerin** - humectant, comes with extracts; **Pentylene Glycol** - humectant, comes with extracts; **Xanthan Gum** - thickener; **Polysorbate 20** - solubilizer for extracts; **Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate** - chelator; **Potassium Sorbate** - part of preservation system; **Sodium Benzoate** - part of preservation system; **Ethylhexylglycerin** - part of preservation system; **1,2-Hexanediol** - part of preservation system; **Caprylyl Glycol** - part of preservation system.\n\nTo estimate content of each ingredient I used [WhatsInMyJar](https://whatsinmyjar.com/product/the-ordinary-aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution) analyzer. They provide rough numbers based on typical usage rate and relation between ingredients.\n\nThe simplified version would skip all marketing ingredients and use less diverse number of components. It would require:\n\n1. Some red water extract to give authentic color. I decided to use concentrated red tea;\n2. Humectant and solubilizer for BHA. Propylene Glycol is a good choice because it can do both;\n3. Thickener. Xanthan Gum is a good choice since it is tolerant to acidic environment;\n4. Acids. I decided to use a mix of Glycolic and Lactic acid as AHA;\n5. Sodium Hydroxide to raise the pH up to 3.3 - 3.5;\n6. Preservative.\n\nMy formula skips Aloe and Sodium Hyaluronate as a marketing ingredients, uses only one humectant that is also a solubilizer at the same time, skips the chelator since acidic environment is chelating enough.\n\n# The formula\n\nUsually Lactic Acid is sold as 80% solution and Glycolic Acid as 70% solution. But these numbers may be different for you, so two versions of the formula are provided: one for common numbers and one for pure acids.\n\nAmount of Sodium Hydroxide required is calculated based on pKa of acids and Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Amount of Propylene Glycol is calculated based on [my guidelines for Salicylic Acid solubilization](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/1d22zx8/formulation_guidelines_for_salicylic_acid_2_serum/) and actual water content.\n\n|Ingredient|Percentage|-|Ingredient|Percentage|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|*Phase A*|||||\n|Red tea extract|33,8%||Red tea extract|42.0%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide|4,5%||Sodium Hydroxide|4,5%|\n||||||\n|*Phase B*|||||\n|Lactic Acid (80%)|12,5%||Pure Lactic Acid|10.0%|\n|Glycolic Acid (70%)|25,7%||Pure Glycolic Acid|20.0%|\n||||||\n|*Phase C*|||||\n|Propylene Glycol|20,0%||Propylene Glycol|20.0%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2,0%||Salicylic Acid|2.0%|\n|Xanthan Gum|0,5%||Xanthan Gum|0.5%|\n||||||\n|Euxyl PE9010|1,0%||Euxyl PE9010|1.0%|\n\n# Directions\n\n1. *Phase A:* Firstly prepare concentrated red tea extract. Heat tea with water to simmer for some time;\n2. Strain the extract and cool it down in a refrigerator. We need a very cold liquid;\n3. Weight out the amount required for the formula. Slowly add 1/3 of Sodium Hydroxide while stirring;\n4. Cool down the solution and add next portion of Sodium Hydroxide. Repeat until the whole amount is used;\n5. *Phase B:* In another beaker combine Glycolic Acid and Lactic Acid;\n6. *Phase C:* In the third beaker combine Propylene Glycol and Salicylic Acid. Stir until dissolved;\n7. Add Xanthan Gum and stir to disperse it evenly;\n8. *Combine:* Slowly pour mix of acids (Phase B) into tea extract while stirring. The color gonna change back to red;\n9. Then slowly pour this mix of Phase A + Phase B to Phase C while stirring;\n10. Check the pH and adjust it;\n11. Add the preservative and stir to distribute it evenly.\n\n# Notes:\n\n* The reaction of Sodium Hydroxide and water is exothermic and produces a lot of heat, so we need to add Sodium Hydroxide in portions and cool down the solution in-between. Always add Sodium Hydroxide to water, not vice versa for better control of the temperature;\n* The color of tea extract in Phase A gonna darken a lot because of highly alkaline environment;\n* Cosmetologists of the past used to use crashed grapes as a source of Glycolic Acid. Maybe that's why this formula smells like wine. Together with the color it makes exact impression of being one;\n* During long storage the extract gonna react with the acids and become much lighter or even change color.\n\nImages of the result:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Ggktdgv](https://imgur.com/a/Ggktdgv)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/3AEiexn](https://imgur.com/a/3AEiexn)",

    "body": "Hey, \n\nSince I sometimes feel a bit weak on keto (without being low on sodium) and don't want to eat spinach all day,  I wanted to supplement both potassium and magnesium. Now a few questions about that:\n\nMost people here supplement potassium with lite/nosalt.  However a comment on [/r/ketoscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/4702fk/electrolyte_supplement/d09x2lu)  said that too much potassium _and_ sodium chloride could have a negative impact on your chloride balance, which could result in reduced water retention (and hence increased urinating and sweating?). \n\nFor both magnesium and potassium, I read that you should prefer the chelated forms ie citrate,  gluconate etc. \nPotassium citrate sounds good in a way that it's absorption is pretty efficient and that it was pretty effective in reducing kidney stones,  which with more spinach (oxalate)  and potential uric acid/ketones competition (urate)  would be nice to have.  However again people said that it might interfere with ketosis and that it could be irritating on the gut lining. \nHow are the other potassium chelates? (hydrogen carbonate,  gluconate etc?) \n\n\nAbout magnesium supplements I really don't know anything about,  could someone give a brief overview for the different types  and which are preferred? \n\nFinally, _when_ should I take those supplements, and should I take them together?  Some people say that certain forms of magnesium complexes taken before bed make them sleep well,  but also cause a hangover the next morning. \n\n\n\nAnyway ,  I would greatly appreciate if someone could give me a bit of an insight. \nThanks in advance :)",

Once it’s in the bladder, it can bounce around for months before it finally gets in exactly the right position to be peed out. I really notice the stone when it’s sitting in my bladder! Especially right at the end of peeing. My trick for getting a stone out of my bladder is to stay on my feet for as long as possible drinking a ton of water and holding it in until I feel like I’m about to explode. Quite often that pressure and position will help to push the stone out. You just need some force behind it. Don’t worry too much about discomfort in peeing it out.

Also, could you rate them on order of importance with \"1\" being the most important (i.e. if all are equally important then 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).  For example my top five are:\n\n1 - Hydroxyzine\n\n2 -  Niacin\n\n2 - Potassium Citrate\n\n2 - Magnesium Glycinate\n\n3 - Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)\n\nTip:  If your ranking isn't 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, don't add a period after the number.

What symptoms does this help?  Have you done anything to verify they are helpful (i.e. stop and restart the supp/med)?\n\nI'm hopeful that this post may be helpful to all here, and also be beneficial to the medical and human bioscience professionals lurking here putting forth the effort to help us Long Haulers.",

    "body": "Cross post from r/residency - will write a brief guide to insulin regimens and pain regimens in the coming days\n\nSeems like people enjoyed the bowel regimen post so here's one about electrolyte repletion. You might know a lot of this stuff already but there also might be some new stuff for you to learn also. Plus when I was starting out last year I never knew when to give oral or IV potassium, or what options were available in general so hopefully this can help with that. Comments/feedbacks/suggestions are welcome!! :)  \n  \n------------\n  \nShould we really be replacing potassium and magnesium all the time? Eh, the evidence isn't great but we usually do it anyways to avoid getting paged constantly. We should probably change that though. Here's some background:  \n​  \nCommon clinical practice suggests replacing K > 4 and Mg > 2, especially in patients at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.\n2000 Practice Guidelines = https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/485434  \n​  \nHowever, evidence for replacing to these goals is very poor.   \nBackground = [Potassium Repletion: Why So Common in Hospitalized Heart Failure Patients?](https://www.medpagetoday.com/resource-centers/focus-hyperkalemia/potassium-repletion-why-so-common-hospitalized-heart-failure-patients/2680)  \nJournal Article = [O'Sullivan et al \\(JAMA Dec 2019\\)   \n](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31339844/)​  \nEvidence shows that extremes (K < 3.5 or > 4.5) are associated with worse outcomes. Not just a random mildly low K of 3.6 or 3.8.  \nJournal Article = [Patel et al \\(Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovascular Care May 2017\\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5410890/)  \n​  \n#Potassium\nGive 10 mEq for every 0.1 you want the potassium to go up.  \nExample: K 3.6 and you want it to be 4.0 = give 40 mEq IV or PO potassium  \nExample: K 3.2 and you want it to be 4.0 = give 40 mEq IV potassium + 40 mEq PO potassium  \nIf patient is severely hypokalemic (K < 3.0), they will need more than 10 mEq per 0.1 increase.  \n​  \n* If patient has AKI or CKD, give LESS potassium to avoid hyperkalemia (probably 50% or less of what you would normally give)!  \n* Per /u/renegaderaptor, K is also absorbed very readily thru the gut, and PO K is much less expensive than IV K. So unless the pt is critically ill, or the labs are critically low, PO K > IV K in most cases. It’s also best to give in divided doses orally if you go over ~40 mEq (so PO 30 & 30 four hrs later would be good for a person with K 3.4). Also, the tab is sustained release (that’s what SR is), which means it won’t act rapidly and won’t be reflected in the labs for several (I think 12ish?) hours. If you’re going to be checking a K soon after, or want rapid (but not emergent) onset, do oral solution.  \n​  \n**Options:**  \n- KCl SR tablet = downside is it is a very large pill and can be hard for patients to swallow  \n- KCl oral liquid = tastes horrible, some patients prefer though  \n- KCl IV = burning is a very common side effect which is intolerable for some patients. You can try giving with lidocaine ([may not be best practice but some places do it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730072/)) or piggyback onto maintenance fluids to reduce this effect. Also each 10 mEq equals 50 mL which may be a lot of unwanted volume for patients.  \n- K-Lyte (potassium bicarb and potassium citrate) effervescent tablets = good option to try if patient can't tolerate the regular tablet, comes in 25 mEq and 50 mEq forms  \n​  \nPeripherally you can only give 10 mEq/hr by IV.   \nIf you have central access, you can give up to 20 mEq/hr by IV.  \n​  \n* One reason for refractory hypokalemia = low magnesium. Check their magnesium levels and replace it before giving potassium if this is the case!   \nMagnesium normally inhibits K+ secreting channels in the collecting duct, so if you don't have enough Mg you will start spilling potassium.  \n​  \nSide effects of hypokalemia = muscle weakness, paralysis, arrhythmias  \n​  \n#Magnesium\nEach 1 gm IV magnesium will raise serum level by 0.1.  \n400 gm PO magnesium (the standard dose) is [equivalent](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d1b951_5bf71f0890714bc9bc721dc9fb26ebaa~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_660,h_77,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/Screenshot_29.webp) to about 2 gm IV, though this doesn't account for differences in PO absorption.  \n​  \n**Options**  \n- MgSO4 IV = pretty much the go to method for magnesium replacement. Just consider how much fluid is in each dose.  \n- Magnesium oxide tablets = causes diarrhea frequently which is why it is not preferred. Give if needed though. Common doses you can try are 400 mg x 1, 400 mg daily for 2 days, 400 mg BID for 2 days, etc.  \n​  \nSide effects of hypomagnesemia = muscle cramps (Charley horse), numbness/tingling, arrhythmias, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia (induces resistance to PTH)  \n​  \n#Calcium  \nOften needs correction especially in ICU level patients, as this can affect their respiratory dynamics.  \nRemember to check if the patient is actually hypocalcemic or not by correcting for albumin.   \nCorrected Ca = (4 - albumin) * 0.8 + Ca  \nWe also sometimes check serum ionized Ca levels which bypasses the need for correction entirely  \n​  \n**Options**  \n- Calcium chloride IV = preferred in patients with cardiac arrest, higher concentration (3x more) than calcium gluconate. Generally only to be given in patients with CENTRAL ACCESS given the risk of tissue necrosis  \n- Calcium gluconate IV = preferred in non-cardiac arrest patients, lower risk of tissue necrosis if fluid extravasates. In general, most studies show calcium gluconate raises serum calcium the same as calcium chloride but with lower risk, just a few studies in critically ill patients showed that calcium chloride was a little faster. Typical dose = 1-2 gm. This should probably be your go to.  \n- Calcium carbonate (Tums) PO = 500mg to 4g/day in 1-3 divided doses  \n- Calcium citrate PO = 200mg to 1g/day in single or divided doses  \n​  \nNice algorithm for treatment on UpToDate = [link](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=ENDO%2F115835&topicKey=ENDO%2F826&source=see_link)  \nBasically, if calcium <7.5 or ionized <0.8, give IV. Otherwise try PO if patient can tolerate.  \n  \n\n*One reason for refractory hypocalcemia = low magnesium. Check magnesium levels and replace!  \n​  \nSide effects of hypocalcemia = perioral numbness (first sign), Trousseau's sign (involuntary hand/arm contraction with checking BP), Chvostek's sign (facial twitching with light touch), bronchospasm, muscle numbness/spasms/tingling, seizures, altered mental status, arrhythmias (prolonged QT common)  \n​  \n#Phosphate  \n  \nLol I don't actually really know how to replace phosphorus that well . . . don't really have to do it that much. For this one, we use mmol instead of mEq to calculate how much to give.  \n​  \nNormal range at UC Davis = 2.4-5.0 mg/dL  \n​  \n**Options**  \n- Potassium + sodium phosphate (K-Phos) tablet PO = use if just mild hypophosphatemia ( > 2.0), side effect is diarrhea if you use too much so if you need high doses just give IV. Just give 1-2 tablets PO TID with meals for a day or two idk.\n- Sodium phosphate IV = probably use this one more than IV potassium phosphate because there's no potassium  \n- Potassium phosphate IV = 21 mEq potassium per 15 mmol phosphate  \n​  \nUpToDate says to weight base dose all this stuff but it seems a little too complicated. I saw this tip on Reddit:  \n​  \n< 2.0 = 15 mmol sodium phos IV over 4 hours  \n< 1.5 = 30 mmol sodium phos IV over 6 hours  \n< 1.0 = 45 mmol sodium phos IV over 8 hours  \n   \nSide effects of hypophosphatemia = basically all the same stuff as above, muscle weakness and cramps, bone pain",

It has no psyllium husk powder. It also includes a lot of info about the ingredients' production processes. \n\n>Potassium (3500mg) from Potassium Gluconate (15,750mg) - Potassium is produced commercially from the mineral Sylvite (KCl)\n\n>Sodium (1500mg) from Sodium Chloride (2100mg) - Sodium Chloride is mass-produced by the evaporation of seawater...\n\n>Calcium (1000mg) from Calcium Carbonate (2500mg) - Calcium carbonate is primarily used in the construction industry as a building material and comes from rocks such as calcite and limestone.\n\n>Vitamin C (90mg) as Ascorbic Acid - Today ascorbic acid is produced industrially from glucose by the Reichstein process, which won Tadeus Reichstein the Nobel Prize in 1933.\n\n>Vitamin B3 (16mg) as Niacin - Thousands of tons of Niacin are synthesized annually from 3-methylpyridine.\n\n>Zinc (11mg) from Zinc Sulfate (27.5mg) - Over 12 million tonnes of zinc are produced annually, mostly for industrial use\n\n>Vitamin B5 (5mg) as Calcium d-pantothenate - Pantothenate can be synthesized industrially from any lactone and beta-Alanine.\n\n> Vitamin D (15ug) as Ergocalciferol - Interestingly, vitamin D is produced industrially by exposing a sheep’s wool grease product or alternatively yeast or mushroom extracts to intense UVB light.\n\nThe following micros don't have any production information. Vitamin Bp (550mg) from Choline Bitartrate (1375mg), Vitamin E (15mg) as Alpha-tocopherol, Manganese (2.3mg) from Manganese Sulfate (6.4mg), Vitamin B2 (1.3mg) as Riboflavin, Vitamin B6 (1.3mg) as Pyridoxine HCL, Vitamin B1 (1.2mg) as Thiamin HCL, Vitamin A (900ug) from Retinyl palmitate (1636ug), Copper (900ug) from Copper Gluconate (6429ug), Vitamin B9 (400ug) as Folic Acid, Iodine (150ug) from Potassium Iodide, Vitamin K (120ug) as Phytonadione, Selenium (55ug) from Sodium Selenite (120ug), Molybdenum (45ug) from Sodium Molybdate (98ug), Chromium (35ug) from Chromium Chloride (106ug), Vitamin B7 (30ug) as Biotin, Vitamin B12 (2.4ug) as Cyanocobalamin.\n\nA lot of those sound like they're derived from pretty basic industrial and chemical processes though.",

    "body": "I really want to be on this diet. I'm female, late 20s, have a low BMI, and am doing keto for depression. My mind feels clearer on keto, and after all the science I've read I'm convinced it's way healthier than all the carbs I used to eat. I'm looking for any ideas on what might be going wrong, tests I should do to investigate, or any other advice on moving forward. \n\nI was on keto for a little over 2 months - after the initial keto flu for the first two weeks, I felt great. My only concern at that point was that my heartrate was really high, but blood pressure was normal so I kept going. I also had a new pain in one knee joint, but brushed it off. Then a little more than a month in, I started having pains in my wrists. Then more pain came - both knee joints hurt, all the joints in my fingers, my shins, the joints in my feet, even my elbows on occasion. It was hard to tell if it was the joints, bones, muscles, or a mix of everything. The pain was mild but very distracting, and it got to the point where my knees hurt so badly I couldn't run more than a few steps (I didn't run regularly or particularly increase exercise while on keto, but I'm often late for things and jog a bit to make it on time). \n\nAt a loss after visiting a doctor, I reintroduced carbs as an experiment and the next day all my pain disappeared. While on keto, the only thing that seemed to lessen the pain was hydration, so of course I thought of electrolytes. However, I had been eating, drinking, and supplementing with so many electrolytes that this seemed impossible. Additionally, my blood test the day before reintroducing carbs showed my electrolyte levels were all within the normal range. I'd maybe get slightly under the ambitious keto-recommended amounts each day, but I'd typically get at least 4,000mg sodium, 4,000mg potassium, and 600-700mg magnesium total each day tracked on Cronometer. Food elecrolytes came from things like cheese, kale, broccoli, and avocado. Non-food electrolytes were from a magnesium complex of oxide and citrate, magnesium L-threonate, potassium citrate, and occasionally calcium citrate. \n\nThese issues seem unlike what others experience. I had a doctor look at my joints, and I didn't match the symptoms of anything they could think of like arthritis. Since I don't have the typical body type of most doing keto for weight loss, I'm wondering if something about the diet doesn't agree with my body, but I don't know where to look. Would a nutritionist even be able to help with something like this? What kind of doctor should I even go to? My PCP seems to know very little about this diet.",

        "body": "Hi, i also had body pains going keto. The key for me was a ketone/glucose meter. When i was restricting my carbs too much i would get severe body pains and very low blood sugar. For me i measure my ketones and aim at 0,5-1,0 ketone levels. This requires me to eat some carbs with every meal once a while. In example: I notice that when i eat 50-100g beans with my keto evening meal which is 15g carbs my body responds very well to it. I definitely need these kinds of carbs regularly. And it doesnt hinder me being in ketosis. \n\nSo the body pains for me came when i was doing too extreme keto. A ketone meter helped me measure my ketones and balance out my carbs. I eat very low glycemic index carbs and i can handle about 40-70g (estimate) a day and still be in 0,5-1,0 range nutritional ketose. Maybe in a few months i can do even lower carbs. But i think the pains were my body saying i was cutting carbs too fast.\n\nSo i take it slow and let my body heal in mild nutritional ketosis 0,5-1,0 range until i feel i can do some more extreme (intermittent) fasting or even lower carbs. This might take months or years.\n\nP.s. also i can not handle any electrolytes they screw me over and give me intestinal problems and lower back pain. Only thing i can handle is magnesium, which is a godsend. I also dont drink water too much, because these flush out my electrolytes. But this is my body i think the key element is learning to listen to your body in what it needs. Something i have lost a long time ago\n\nP.p.s.\n\nIn the beginning when i was experimenting and adjusting to keto my pains would also immediately stop when I introduced a heavy carb meal like oatmeal. So i think u just have to balance it out and take it slow, ur story sounds very similar to mine.",

    "body": "This is part of a dual post that I want to give back to this community, to help inform people looking to do a longer fast (i.e. more than a few days). [My other post focused on what it feels like](https://www.reddit.com/r/Water_Fasting/comments/k5y6pv/just_completed_a_30_day_fast_this_is_what_i/). This one focuses on the objective physical changes to your body. If you're thinking of doing a water fast, or just started your fast then I recommend you look at both.\n\nBefore this 30 day fast, I respectively did a 3 day and 12 day fast. [I've posted the blood result of the 12 day fast before on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Water_Fasting/comments/ivxp1t/day_12_blood_test_urate_double_the_max_value/). I felt I learned a lot about what to expect through that, instead of jumping straight into a 30 day stretch. As always, prioritize your safety. Water fasting is NOT without health risks!\n\nTo give some explanation of what each test measured:\n\n\\- **Blood test**: blood cell count (red, white, platelet, etc), blood cell types, Vitamin B12 (essential vitamin that keeps blood cells healthy), Iron content, glucose levels, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, eGFR (= kidney function), Urate (=Uric acid, waste product of tissue breakdown), liver enzym levels.\n\n\\- **Urine test**: Albumin/Creatinine Ratio (used in identifying kidney problems)\n\n\\- **DEXA scan**: A specialized type of X-ray machine that is the most accurate way to quantify body fat %. It can quantifies the exact amount fat mass vs lean mass (muscles & organs).\n\nMy results:\n\n**Blood + Urine baseline test before starting**\n\n* All values in normal range (incl. Urate: 320 umol/L)\n\n**Blood + Urine test after 12 day water fast**:\n\n* Urate: 725 umol/L (normal range: 230-480 umol/L)\n* Vitamin B12: 1360 (138-652 pmol/L)\n\nAt this point I broke my fast. The urate value is concerning since it can form gout or kidney stones. The urate is a waste product from the dismanteling of fat and protein molecules, which the body does a ton of during a water fast. Normally the kidneys filter it out, but with a water fast they simply get overwhelmed. I started researching a way to neutralize it or flush it out chemically.\n\nI settled on using potassium citrate, which is normally used to treat kidney stones. I used it during the 30 day fast, adding 1 pill per day (100mg) to the electrolyte mix. I also added 100 mg magnesium citrate (which is supposed to promote potassium citrate absorption) and a vitamin D3. For some weird reason my body makes crazy amounts of B12 too.\n\n**Blood + Urine test midway of 30 day water fast (day 13)**\n\n* Red blood cell count: 4.41 (4.50-6.00)\n* Urate: 762 umol/L (normal range: 230-480 umol/L)\n* Vitamin B12: 809 (138-652 pmol/L)\n\nDang it. The potassium citrate didn't work. I decided to keep going but quadruple the dose to 400mg / day. The low red blood cell count is a little worrying, but close enough. B12 still crazy high, but I can't find why that would be bad.\n\n**Blood + Urine test on last day of 30 day water fast (day 30)**\n\n* White blood cell count: 3.4 (4.0 - 11.0)\n* Red blood cell count: 4.64 (4.50-6.00)\n* Vitamin B12: 771 (138-652 pmol/L)\n* Iron content: 370 (22-275 ug/L)\n* Urate: 519 umol/L (normal range: 230-480 umol/L)\n* Albumin / Creatinine: 3.6 ( < 2.0)\n\nThat finally worked for urate. Next time I'll use 600mg/day for good measure to force it down even more. I was feeling exhausted all the time now, maybe because of the low blood cell count? Albumin/Creatinine from the urine test flashed as high, but not high enough to indicate a real problem.\n\n**DEXA scan before 30 day water fast (day 0)**\n\n* Total mass: 168.4 lbs (33.5 lbs fat + 129.3 lbs lean mass)\n* BF%: 20.6%\n\n**DEXA scan after 30 day water fast (day 30+1)**\n\n* Total mass: 143.5 lbs (25.9 lbs fat + 112.1 lbs lean mass)\n* BF%: 18.8\n\nThe scale shows I lost 25 lbs in one month (wow!)\n\nHowever the DEXA scan shows it burned at a 7.6 lbs fat - 17.3 mixture. So for every lbs of fat i burned I also lost 3x times as much muscle!! A lot of that will be water weight I believe, so I do think my body will recover that water somewhat. 7.6 lbs of fat is still impressive - more than I ever dropped so fast - but the price was also very high in my opinion. Especially if those kidney values don't stabilize (we'll see later).\n\nI believe that the reason I dropped so much lean mass is because I was too exhausted to exercise anymore past day 14. As soon as you stop exercising (which your body eventually does force on you), the body seems to switch to bunkering down and burning your insides, rationing the rest of the fat to save your life. By that time your kidneys will have undergone weeks of hard strain as well. I'm just saying, if you do this be careful and remember you don't 'feel' some of the risks this diet can bring. Medical supervision is advised.\n\nIt is possible that a lot of this depends on your body frame, so that if you're overweight (I was not), you might burn proportionally more fat. In any case, a lot of it will be water weight which will return no matter what you do. That's actually a good thing, as clearly this way of fuel burning doesn't just take fat cells.\n\n**Update (5 days after end of diet):** I've discussed the results above with my doctor. He sees nothing to worry about in them. The higher kidney values were insignificant, he says a real problem would have shown up as 30-40 vs my 3.6, so my kidneys are fine.He can't explain why B12 was always so high, but he immediately dismissed the idea of B12 coming from muscle breakdown. He thinks I just have a lucky genetic marker to stockpile huge amounts of B12 naturally.Meanwhile my muscle mass now definitely seems bigger again, presumably from taking up water weight. I'm planning to do another DEXA scan and blood test after 60 days. Just to see if B12 really stays this high and to compare long term vs short term diet effects. Maybe the real DEXA payoff is just delayed.\n\n**Update (60 days after end of diet) DEXA scan**\n\n* Total mass: 170.4 lbs (36.5 lbs fat + 128.2 lbs lean mass)\n* BF%: 22.2\n\nI've been refeeding for the last two months, exercising and taking care to eat extra healthy, definitely no junk food. Even so as you can see I'm more or less back at the same levels before the 30 day water fast, with 3 lbs extra fat and 1 lbs less muscle. There's no way I rebuild that much muscle in two months. DEXA likely just isn't reliable for people who just shed huge amounts of water weight. I'm slightly worse of now than before starting. My fat mass simply returned (albeit slowly if eating healthy post-diet), while some muscle was permanently lost.\n\n**I hope this gives people some concrete numbers on what to expect medically. Consult your doctor! I talked over my ideas and results with mine regularly, and found him surprisingly openminded about it.** \n\n**Unfortunately, it does not seem like the 30 day water diet benefited me. I took a health risk, permanently lost some muscle mass, while regaining the fat mass that I had lost in the diet. However, keep in mind I was already at a healthy weight before starting.** ",

I went to see my urologist and the capsules haven’t done much, my stones  have grown a little bit in the past couple of years. I’m scheduled to do some lithotripsies in May to clear everything out. \n\nHas anyone been in this position? Have you been able to biohack your way out of it? I’d love to stop overproducing calcium.

    "body": "Before I fixed my PFD, was always messing with stuff that would make me feel better even temporarily. I will list the two most important, in hopes that it might help others as well.\n\n1. Internal rotation of the hip will almost instantly relax the pelvic floor. It worked for me because of a weak TFL and tight gluteus maximus and piriforms + obturators. I didn't knew at the time which muscle is causing the issues, I just knew it worked. Sometimes I would make an incredible effort of falling asleep with my TFL tensed, or walking.\n2. Perineum massage. This one used to offer me around 4-5 hours of \"free time\" or symptoms free. Would lay in bed on one side, use 3 fingers and push into my perineum ( softly ) and make circles for around 5 minutes. If I over did them, very small blood flow to the penis would appear. So I always stuck with 5 minutes or even less that would let me work on other things for a few hours without complaining about the issue.\n3. Hip flexor stretch. My issues were both the psoas and the rectus femoris. I didn't knew at the time I had APT, but I always saw a small relief and a 2 minute stretch kept on each side. I was doing lunge stretches with a posterior pelvic tilt. I would do a plank afterwards to keep some tension in the transversus abdominis. This all made a lot more sense once I found out I had anterior pelvic tilt. \n\nUse this for a TEMPORARY relief until you find out what your underlying issue is, as that PF is not getting tensed on its own.\n\nMy issue was anterior pelvic tilt, which was causing duck feet. These two created a waterfall effect all over my body, PF included. \n\nDuck feet was the fastest to fix, took about two to three weeks. APT about 3 months to see a permanent fix.\n\nFor those who suffer from premature ejaculation as well, a perineum massage 1 hour before sex and performing in a standing position with hips internally rotated will (most probably) help you keep going for as long as you want. It was like discovering nirvana when I found out. \n\nPE went away, pain in the left side of the glans went away, and along with that, a weird pain in my left tow as well, urination is flawless now, everything works.\n\nAs you advance, work out these muscles to keep your spine in place:\n\n* transversus abdominis\n* internal obliques\n* external obliques\n* QL muscle\n* multifidus\n* lower abs ( pick exercises that will lift the pelvis up, otherwise you're just training hip flexors )\n* glutes ( insist on gluteus medius + minimus to keep hips straight )\n* hamstrings ( don't stretch them, if they are weak it's a cause from something else and will most likely loosen up along with glute activation )\n* calves ( at least once every two weeks, also stretch these )\n* latisimus ( once in a while if you're not going to the gym to keep you from slouching )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few supplements that offered SOME KIND of relief:\n\n* potassium citrate ( half a teaspoon in water 3 times a day, also helps with bower movements ) this will loosen up muscles if potassium was an issue for them\n* magnesium citrate (400mg is what I took, I could tell when I forgten as I was defficient and muscles would cramp )\n\nThat's about it. You got this!",

I produce them almost every year and I've had I think all kinds once, with the calcium phosphte ones being produced the most, uric acid close second, at first we changed my diet, also needed to drink more water. Tried exercising more. That maybe worked for 2 years. Then back to stones annually. My new specialist said I have acidic pee and need to have 20meq of potassium citrate daily to help keep stones smaller and it helps with the acid in my pee. (I think I understood that's what he meant, lol). I also need to keep drinking more water (this is a hard one for me).\n\n I get large ones and small ones together. Ranging as high as 8mm to as low as 2mm (as seen on CT scans/x-rays over the year.). At the moment I've had a 7mm stone non-obstructing in my right kidney and also a 2mm stone in same side but not in same spot. In my left right now I have a 2mm and 3mm stone also in different spots. They don't really bug me. I know the big one has been there for min 2 years. Funny specialist recently told me I am better and I don't need to see him. I get  a CT scan for something completely different, instead they see 4 active non-obstructive kidney stones. Lol.\n\nI don't even feel pain anymore when I get them, I just feel the need to throw up over and over again. Once I get some pain relief I'm fine and I try to sleep it off. Not sure when these will pass, they seem to start staying longer and longer each visit.\n\nThanks for reading my condensed.story of my kidney stone journey",

        "body": "Howdy 22!  Call me 25. I understand completely what it’s like being a prolific producer of renal calculi. I’ll share a few things I have experienced. \n\n1.  12 lithotripsies since 1998 (11 ESWL, 1 laser ureteroscopy). \n\n2. Every KUB, CT, MRI and U-sound since 1998 has shown the culprit stone, plus multiple others. Bilateral every time. Everybody grows them. Most people pass them without being aware (too small to be felt).\n\n3. My experience is not typical. I have never passed a stone “naturally” and knew I was doing it. Never felt the slightest discomfort, never observed little units when I took leaks. I grow big mofos 9-16mm, impassable, which find a cozy spot to settle and grow and finally start grinding on inner tissue of K. I know the feeling all too well. \n\n3. On one miserable occasion in 2003, I passed 50+ stone frags “unnaturally” over a 2-3 hour period. I took a stroll down the steinstrasse. This is a man-made event which can follow ESWL.  Can’t call it “rare,” but it happens often enough to qualify as “infrequent.” Usually, post-ESWL, the frags pass over 1-3 weeks, and some are large enough to be felt in the urethra. No big deal. A few unlucky bastards pass ALL OF THEM AT ONE TIME! That’s steinstrasse (street of stones), which is what the poor ureter looks like in a CT scan. Huge fucking traffic jam, massive obstruction, and all the misery of passing a big boy, but WORSER. \n\n4.  When I learned about laser ureteroscopy (earlier this year), I swore I would never do ESWL again. That was June and my 12th go-round. L-U does everything ESWL does, but (a) it collects frags and removes them when scope is pulled out, thus eliminating the possibility of steinstrasse, (b) does a lot less collateral damage/irritation/inflammation to surrounding tissue—laser works at point-blank range inside the K—ESWL is far less discriminating, and offends layers of skin, muscles, abdominal wall, K exterior and interior before it reached stone, but (c) does require patient to endure 4-5 post-op days with stent. Irritating at worst. Discomfort low-medium on pain scale. \n\n5.  To me, I’ll readily accept that discomfort in exchange for elimination of another steinstrasse episode. \n\n6.  Older brother’s experience was the opposite of mine. From age 20 until he died at 43, he had what seemed like semi-annual stone-passing events. Events, meaning obstructive stones. So bad, and so frequent, his U-doc gave him a standing prescription for morphine tablets. He kept some in his car, briefcase and home. I watched these episodes more than once. When he felt that sensation, he would scramble to his stash, pop 2-3 tablets, start guzzling water, lay on floor with hips elevated, wiggle and gyrate his torso, all the while praying the drugs kicked in before the pain. \n\n7.  Good luck getting that kind of prescription today. \n\n8.  You mentioned calcium phosphate and uric acid stones. Never known anyone who has had that double pleasure, but it doesn’t surprise me. U-doc had me do a 24-hr urine collection recently, and for the very first time, I had elevated uric acid. Shit!  That’s all I need. \n\n9. More interesting was that you did not mention calcium oxalates stones. Calcium-variety stones most people grow will be a blend of CaC2O4 and Ca3(PO4)2.  Have all of yours been the latter? \n\nfinally\n\n10.  Two counter-intuitive dietary “things” for calcium stone crowd. (a) Too much dietary calcium [or CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS] DON’T CAUSE STONES. They prevent them!!!  calcium binds with oxalates anytime, anywhere. When they hook up in digestive tract, they are excreted there. This is a good thing!!  They stuff never enters urinary tract. (b) EXCESS VITAMIN-C is A BAD THING!! When unabsorbed Vitamin- C is metabolized, one of the key metabolites is OXALATE, and that oxelate takes an express train to the urinary tract. Bad News for many of us here. \n\nI’ll stop.",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nSuper short summary for context:\n\n22 year old male here who has suffered from 6 years of cognitive issues now. Went from near top of class in special nerdy programs to absolutely stupid, dropping out of high school at 17. Long story short, after tons of docs, Mayo Clinic stays, tests, scans, etc, I started trying different diets and only recently found that my new diet has given me some good days. Days where my brain has some of it's ability back to create complex thought... I haven't had days like these for over 5 years until starting this diet on January 6th 2019. So my question is, is this diet sustainable? I'm happy to incorporate new things one at a time. I'd love to hear about your diet if you're on keto for similar reasons!\n\nIt's essentially an extremely strict keto. I only eat duck eggs, ground beef, chuck roasts, salmon roe, salmon, salt, pepper. I take cod liver oil, broccoli sprouts, spinach, MCT oil, and collagen powder daily. Probably going to get an air fryer and add chicken wings to the mix for the extra collagen in the skin (who am I kidding, mainly just want to munch on some wings lol). Another imperative question: Is it okay to keep increasing my MCT oil until it's a large supply of my fat or should I try to keep the fats varying from different sources? I started out mostly carnivore as a sort of elimination diet and have worked things like spinach and MCT oil into the mix but I'd like to lessen my beef intake and trade it with MCT oil if that's a healthier alternative.\n\nI supp with potassium citrate at my discretion like most of you and 300-450mg of bio-available magnesium daily. Supp zinc and D3/K2 lightly every other day and Calcium lightly every 3-5 days. My GP supplies me a vitamin/mineral abundant multivitamin but I feel like it’s kind of unnecessary and just cut it off 2 days ago after taking daily for 3+ months. Any advice or input is appreciated :). Thanks!",

    "body": "Inspired by that other post on hydration, I did a lot of research to find these specific options.\n\nTLDR:\n\n* Chloride-based electrolyte drinks can taste metallic (e.g. using all potassium chloride instead of potassium citrate).\n\n* WHO formula is well-tested, but you don't need to match it exactly--somewhere between 1:1 and 1:2 sodium to potassium in your overall consumption (including diet) works. \n\n* Some form of carbohydrate improves water and electrolyte uptake. It does not have to be sugar.\n\n* Coconut water is widely available and can mimic the WHO formula by adding salt and water.\n\n* There are now many options for unflavored powders with minimal additives.\n\n* Pyridoxine HCl (a form of vitamin B6) is a common additive in commercial hydration powders. Avoid it as it can cause peripheral neuropathy at any dose.\n\n\nElectrolyte drinks can taste metallic or overly salty to some people, and this might be because of the chloride-based electrolytes used in many. If you wonder you don't like the taste of chlorides, try drinking some unflavored Pedialyte; if you tolerate it but don't tolerate other high-chloride options, then you are probably sensitive to the taste of chlorides. It's widely available, so easy to test. It does have some chloride (almost all electrolyte drinks do), but all of its potassium comes from potassium citrate and about 20% of its sodium from sodium citrate. \n\n**I prefer Pedialyte, but it is really expensive, and does not come in an unflavored powder.**\n\nSome background--the WHO rehydration formula is widely considered to be the best benchmark for electrolyte drinks. The ratio of sodium to potassium has some wiggle room which depends on diet. If you tend to eat a lot of salty foods, you will want to err towards drinks with higher potassium content. If you eat tons of vegetables and/or sweat a lot e.g. more than 6 cups of vegetables per day and/or you work in construction, you can probably tolerate the higher sodium formulations.\n\nThe WHO formula calls for carbohydrate in the form of table sugar because it's readily available, but other options like dextrose can have advantages over table sugar. No matter the type of carbohydrate, the addition of some improves the uptake of electrolytes and water.\n\nAlso, it is still necessary to get some chloride. However, most people already get quite a bit from the salt in their diets, and it's also much easier to add chloride using either salt and/or commonly available potassium chloride-based salt substitutes. Finally, most electrolyte drinks contain chloride of some kind anyways.\n\nLast year I looked far and wide for options that used a majority of citrate-based electrolytes, and there wasn't much available. Chloride-based options are plentiful because it's the cheapest form of bulk electrolytes available. So if you can tolerate the taste of those, then options like Trioral, LMNT, etc are fine.\n\nNormalyte Pure is well known and does use some citrate-based electrolytes. However, all of its potassium comes from potassium chloride, and this accounts for the difference in taste between it and unflavored Pedialyte.\n\nI went down the rabbit hole of buying individual electrolytes and mixing my own, but I learned that I would have to measure each ingredient individually before mixing a batch. Combining the dry ingredients and scooping from a bulk dry mix doesn't work without extremely expensive, specialized equipment to ensure they mix uniformly.\n\nSo here's what I've found after doing another search one year later:\n\n#**Coconut water with added water and salt**\n\nCoconut water is an interesting option because it is readily available and has a large amount of potassium. It doesn't taste metallic to many people.\n\nHere are the nutritional facts I used, pulled from the USDA database except for the chloride value which came from some random webpage:\n\n**For 1 Liter unmodified coconut water**\n\n* Potassium\t2500mg\n* Zinc  1mg\n* Chloride\t1180mg\n* Sodium\t1050mg\n* Carbs (g)\t37.1\n* Sugar\t27g\n\nThe recipe I came up with in a hurry, which I'm not super sure about the calculations:\n\nTaking 310 mL (1 and 1/3 cups) coconut water, diluting it with 620 mL (2 and 2/3s cups) water, then adding 1.6-1.7g salt (use a scale, or convert based off the nutrition facts of your salt. If I give a teaspoon measurement it could be horribly misleading depending on the type of salt, e.g. table vs kosher or even between different brands of the same type).\n\nThis should give you approximately the same potassium and sodium that is in a single liter (about a quart) of most electrolyte drinks based on the WHO formula, however, it should contain only 8.5g of sugar compared with 13.5-28g of sugar vs other commercial sweetened electrolyte drinks:\n\n**Modified coconut water, per 930mL:**\n\n* \tPotassium (mg)\t780\n* \tZinc (mg)\t0.312\n* \tChloride (mg)\t1320\n* \tSodium (mg)\t1030\n* \tCarbs (g)\t11.5752\n* \tSugar (g)\t8.424\n\n\n#**Hydrant Unflavored**\n\nThis would be my top pick for powders as it has few additives of concern for people with sensitivities. It would be even better if it had dextrose included. As with Normalyte and Trioral, ratios closely match the WHO formula, but all of its potassium comes from potassium citrate.\n\nhttps://www.drinkhydrant.com/products/unflavored - it closely mimics unflavored Pedialyte, but without the dextrose. It also has a nontrivial amount of zinc, so like with Pedialyte, you'd want to take care with more than 2 servings per day.\n\n#**Powdervitamin**\n\nThis somewhat sketchy looking brand seems like an OK option for those who eat a lot of salty foods.\n\nhttps://www.powdervitamin.com/products/unflavored-electrolytes-powder-50-servings - this brand has a lot more potassium than sodium, and you'd want to add your own salt to make the ratios more like the WHO rehydration formula. It has a small amount of zinc, less than unflavored Pedialyte, but enough to mention if you are consuming more than 4 servings per day. It also has some vitamin C, which may or may not be tolerable to you.\n\n#**K1000**\n\nI'm not a fan of mysterious 'trace mineral complexes' but if you don't mind them, it looks like a more well-established brand than Powdervitamin and has a bit fewer additives.\n\nhttps://adapted-nutrition.com/products/keto-k1000-unflavored - it is similar to 'powdervitamin' above, but with the mystery 'trace mineral complex'. \n\n#**Regenerate 24-7**\n\nAnother semi-sketchy looking brand, similar to the above two, but with more sodium. Still more potassium than the WHO ratios.\n\nhttps://www.regenerate24-7.com/hydration-1 - this also has more potassium than sodium (so you'd want to add your own salt), but it has more sodium than the above two. It also has a nontrivial amount of zinc, so like with Pedialyte, you'd want to take care with more than 2 servings per day.\n\n\n#**Noord**\n\nAn EU option for those who have difficulty getting US products. More sodium than WHO ratio.\n\nhttps://noordcode.com/products/electrolytes-unflavoured - it is a EU brand that has more sodium than potassium\n\n#**Relyte unflavored**\n\nRelatively well known, more sodium than WHO ratio.\n\nhttps://redmond.life/products/re-lyte-hydration - can't link directly to the unflavored option, but it has more sodium than potassium\n\n#**Chloride based options (will taste more metallic)**\n\nThese I don't prefer, but I'm listing them here for completeness. Neither contain zinc and both have an unflavored option.\n\nTrioral is by far the cheapest and has the most chloride: https://www.triselfcare.com/collections/vendors?q=TRIORAL\n\nNormalyte is somewhere in-between Pedialyte and Trioral for chloride content: https://normalyte.com/collections/normalyte-pure-collection\n\n#**Special note on Pyridoxine HCl form of vitamin B6 which is added to many hydration products that aren't on this list**\n\nIt can cause peripheral neuropathy even in small doses: https://www.tga.gov.au/news/safety-updates/peripheral-neuropathy-supplementary-vitamin-b6-pyridoxine",

Vitamin K helps especially when starting keto to stop the ridiculous bruising (vitamin k comes from our gut flora, which dies off and is replaced by new gut flora when we start keto, hence all the bruises some of us get). And I take biotin to prevent my hair falling out. If your hair falls out due to the shock of rapid weight loss, you may need this stuff for a few months. If your hair is going to shed like crazy it usually starts about a month - 2 months after starting keto. It gets better eventually, but having hair all over the house is super annoying.",

I wanted to post a list of signs since I think we are prone to it and so people can recognize it when it happens.\n\n- Heavy/slow/thumping heartbeat: This is one of the easiest signs to recognize. It feels like a heavy \"thump\" to the chest.\n- Heart palpitations and arrhythmia\n- Difficulty breathing\n- Gas and bloating: Another easy to recognize symptom characterized by not being able to relieve the gas.\n- Fatigue and muscle heaviness/aching/weakness: You probably won't want to move and you'll just want to sleep but you won't be able to or it will be difficult.\n- Strange metal taste in mouth\n- Mental confusion: Logically I can sort of tell that I'm not thinking right but afterwards it's easy to see the obvious mental impairment.\n- Inability to sleep: Several times potassium deficiency has actually woken me up. I wake up exhausted but unable to go back to sleep until I take potassium and then I can call back asleep easily.\n- Feeling like you have to piss\n- Painful stinging/tingling like you're getting stung: I get it mostly on my back and shoulders.\n\nOther symptoms include muscle cramps and constipation.\n\n500-1,000mgs of potassium will relieve it in 10mins starting immediately, but it only lasts for about 45mins give or take before you need more. For my recent deficiency it took about 4,000mgs for it to mostly subside, I'm going to keep taking a few thousand mgs per day for while.\n\nSAMe appears to be quite potent at inducing a potassium deficiency so be aware of that if you're taking SAMe. 5-mthf and B12 can also induce a potassium deficiency as well as loss of fluids, excess salt, excess magnesium and probably a lot of other things. Magnesium is probably good to take along with potassium since it plays a major role in potassium regulation, I suspect a magnesium deficiency may be part of the reason why supplements can invoke a potassium deficiency so easily in me.\n\nPotassium deficiency can be dangerous if left unresolved. If you're going to experiment with any supplements which can induce a deficiency you should have some potassium citrate or similar on hand. You can get potassium citrate as a salt substitute at grocery stores, called appropriately enough \"No Salt\".",

    "body": "Caution: very long post. A lot of background  about adrenal disease and kidney disease both, and the evil dance between them, slowly killing me. Neither is curable. My situation is complicated.\n\nI got diagnosed stage 4 CKD February 2023. I was hospitalised with sepsis caused by kidney stones that had bottlenecked in the urethra, causing a massive infection. So a very kind, knowledgable nephrologist was assigned to me, and he continued to be my regular kidney doctor after being discharged. \n\nDr A consulted with me about reducing sodium, potassium, and frequent red meat from my diet. Unfortunately, I cannot, because it will kill me. So I immediately put Dr A in touch with Dr U, my wonderful endocrinologist, to see what they might be able to do to figure me out. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I have had an orphan disease for nearly three decades -- so there is no funding for research: I AM the research; I AM the guinea pig. I have suffered from atypical primary hyperaldosteronism (say that ten times fast - SO many syllables!) for 27 years. You have a tumour or tumours on your adrenal gland or both glands. Also it forces me to either pee or horde mist the hormone aldosterone. I believe it causes me to pee it out.🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nNot sure. There's hyper- and hypo-. So, I have an endocrinologist to treat it.\n\nMe being the overachiever that I am 🙃, I have it on both adrenals, so in my case, an operation removing both would make my life a living hell. That is a whole other supercomplicated can of worms. Death is preferable to it. \n\nIf it's one adrenal gland, they remove it, voila, you're normal, you lucky SOB. Me, not so much. I have it in both, so it is inoperable and incurable.\n\nA friend offered to donate one of his adrenal glands, but the doctors told us that adrenal glands are far too complex to be transplantable, so thanks for being such a bro and trying. 🤷🏻‍♀️The adrenals are small orange triangle shaped glands that sit atop the kidneys.\n\nI bet they argue a lot, my adrenals and kidneys.\r\n\r\nMost people die on average 4 years post diagnosis from the high blood pressure complications they get from high sodium. What typically occurs is you pee out all of your potassium, and in a typical case -- unlike my bizarro Twilight Zone version -- when your potassium drops, your sodium rises; like a seesaw, this happens. Because mine never rises, I don't have that complication. My blood pressure runs low most of the time.\n\nPotassium drops dangerously low with the disorder. One time they gave me four concentrated IV bags of potassium chloride when it had dropped to .9, which should have killed me. Think of the difference between a can of concentrated orange juice and the reconstituted juice to get an idea. \n\nThe male nurse who came to replace bag one with bag two showed me the empty bag and said, \"You're Superwoman. This one bag is enough to kill a Clydesdale.\" \n\nI was stoned all the time on a powerful narcotic cocktail because potassium burns like battery acid. They kept me high as a kite, 24/7 just to tolerate the painful potassium drip. \n\nFour bags of concentrate is my limit before it infiltrates at the IV site and begins actually burning up the flesh in a horrific chemical burn you can't imagine. I had a roommate whose IV burnt a literal hole in her arm. The bone was visible.\n\nAfter four bags, it went up .9 to 1 on the mmol/L measurement. Docs were stunned how the hell I was even alive!\n\nFrom The Mayo Clinic. They explain it better than I:\n\nLow potassium (hypokalemia) refers to a lower than normal potassium level in your bloodstream. Potassium helps carry electrical signals to cells in your body. It is critical to the proper functioning of nerve and muscles cells, particularly heart muscle cells.\n\nNormally, your blood potassium level is 3.6 to 5.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). A very low potassium level (less than 2.5 mmol/L) can be life-threatening and requires urgent medical attention.\n\r\nHere's where my problem is. I don't expect a solution, I just need to vent.\r\n\r\nBecause mine is atypical, I lose ALL of my electrolytes all of the time. I HAVE to eat a ridiculous amount of Himalayan salt every time I have anything to eat. I cannot taste it, and this practise keeps my blood sodium levels in the barely normal range. Like at the cusp of low and normal. I am on massive doses of both potassium chloride and potassium citrate (ironically, to prevent kidney stones), in addition to three times the legal dose of a potassium sparing diuretic. \n\nMy endocrinologist must report to the DEA in triplicate once a month to explain why I need this prescribed amount.\r\n\r\nExtremely high pink salt\r\nExtremely high potassium, two types\r\nDaily red meat, because I am chronically anemic, because I lose pretty much all minerals along with all my electrolytes, I am super-atypical, yay, me. 😞 \n\nI cannot have spinach for iron because of the oxalates. Because of the adrenal disease, it must be heme iron, not plant iron.\r\n\r\nI apologise for the length of this post, but I just wanted to say I'm damned if I do, I'm damned if I don't. Decades of these necessary practises that are mandatory to my diet just to stay alive, and enjoy my time here with my loved ones, are killing my kidneys. If I let my sodium levels drop, my brain stem will collapse, I will experience the most unimaginably painful headache I can't even imagine, and then die.\r\n\r\nWhen my potassium is too low, my entire body contorts itself into a painful, spasming pretzel. I had a stroke caused by nearly nonexistent electrolytes in 1997, which is how I was diagnosed with the adrenal disease. I lay in a coma on and off for most of a 15 year period.\r\n\r\n It is a horrible full time job monitoring my electrolytes every hour. I feel like Sisyphus and his giant boulder from hell. \r\n\r\nSo my specialised diet and treatment plan is the point by point, ahhuolar opposite of a beneficial CKD diet. If I go off that eating plan, I'll be dead in a month or less.  My nephrologist and endocrinologist are both amazing; they work together to try and figure me out while they still can.\n\nIf my potassium drops too low, my heart will just wind down like a wind up toy until it stops. It's come close a few times. If by some freak occurrence it went too high, as severe the opposite direction, that would cause a massive, fatal heart attack.\n\n\r\n",

    "body": "[Original Post Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2205ma/more_than_you_ever_wanted_to_know_about_potassium/)\n\n*****\n\nHey everyone! I just began keto-ing recently and while I've been making sure to get a lot of sodium I was worried that I wasn't getting enough potassium. In considering a potassium supplement I ended up doing LOTS of research and I thought I would summarize my findings and share them here. There's a lot of info out there about *how* to supplement potassium, but I wanted to focus on *whether it's safe to do so* and, if so, *how much* to supplement it. My intention isn't to give a specific recommendation, but to give you some information to help you inform your own decisions, and obviously I recommend consulting with a medical professional. Sorry for the wall of text, but if you're taking a potassium supplement or thinking of taking one I think you'll find this interesting and beneficial.\n\n*****\n\nAt first I had thought, *hey, they've got to make a potassium supplement, right*? Turns out it's not so simple. On one hand you seem to have people chugging *No Salt*, while on the other they're yelling \"don't ever take a potassium supplement! You're going to overdose, go into cardiac arrest, and DIE!\" Meanwhile, even the nutrition experts seem to provide poor guidance. The Council for Responsible Nutrition sets an \"upper level for supplements\" for potassium at 1500mg taken in 500mg doses. The UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals was unable to determine a safe upper limit, but set a guidance level of 3700mg (but states that it may be associated with GI lesions). The FDA, terribly afraid of potassium, sets a 100mg limit, with prescriptions over 100mg requiring the warning label \"there have been several reports, published and unpublished, concerning non specific small-bowl lesions.\"\n\nThe dietary reference intake for potassium in adults is 4700mg\\*, but the average consumption in the North America is about half that. The diuretic effect of a ketogenic diet may cause you to lose additional potassium (especially if you're not getting enough sodium and magnesium!). \"Mild hypokalemia [low potassium] is often without symptoms, although it may cause a small elevation of blood pressure, and can occasionally provoke cardiac arrhythmias. Moderate hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness, myalgia [muscle pain], and muscle cramps, and constipation.\"^1\n\n\\*Note: 4700mg is the \"adequate intake\" level (not enough evidence to set a Recommended Dietary Allowance or RDA) set by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board.^2 The Daily Value (DV) for potassium is still set at 3500mg, so note that this is the number used when calculating percent daily value.^3\n\n**IF YOUR KIDNEYS ARE UNHEALTHY** your ability to excrete excess potassium may be impaired putting you at **GREATER RISK** for hyperkalemia (too much potassium in your blood). The National Kidney Foundation estimates that one in nine adults in the US have chronic kidney disease and many don't even realize it (especially among the elderly).^4 Also be aware that some medications such anti-hypertension drugs and even over-the-counter pain relievers can **increase** potassium retention.^5\n\n*****\n\n# **Don't Trust the Labels!**\nYou may be getting more potassium than you think. According to the FDA, testing for and listing potassium content is **optional** in most cases: \"other nutrients must be included in a food's Nutrition Facts label if the nutrients are added as a nutrient supplement to the food, if the label makes a nutrition claim about them, or if advertising or product literature provides information connecting the nutrients to the food.\"^6 It's likely that if you're using a crowd-sourced nutrient tracking program (e.g., myfitnesspal) that you're missing potassium values for non-obvious foods. For instance: 2 slices of bacon has 93mg of potassium; 1 cup of romaine lettuce has 162mg!^7 But the Nutrition Label on the bag of romaine lettuce I have here has no listing for potassium, and when I searched myfitnesspal for these foods most entries listed a potassium value of 0mg.\n\n*****\n\n# **Magnesium**\nMagnesium is important, too, as it helps in the absorption of potassium. If you're going to take a magnesium supplement, look for magnesium aspartate, magnesium citrate, magnesium lactate, or magnesium chloride, which have better bioavailability (i.e., a higher percentage is able to be absorbed) than the more common magnesium oxide.^8 Some studies have measured the absorption rate of magnesium oxide to be as low as 4%.^9 The RDA for magnesium for men is 400mg for ages 19–30 and 420mg for ages 31+. For women it is 310mg for ages 19–30 and 320mg for ages 31+.^10\n\n*****\n\n# **Potassium Supplements**\nNow, on to the big question – **is it safe to take a potassium supplement?**\n\nOver-the-counter supplements are limited by the FDA to just 99mg. Their reasoning behind this is that potassium in a highly concentrated, rapidly released (i.e., pill) form can be dangerous, but according to *Vitamin and Mineral Safety 2nd Ed.* (2004) \"there is no discernible scientific justification for the FDA threshold of 100mg of potassium for regulation of such products as drugs.\" According to *Vitamin and Mineral Safety*,\n\n>The FNB [Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board] concluded that large amounts of supplemental potassium can cause acute or chronic toxicity, but that there was not enough appropriate data to support a UL [tolerable upper intake level]. The UK EVM [UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals] concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to set an SUL [safe upper intake level], but could support a GL [guidance level]. From the clinical trial evidence judged to be most relevant, UK EVM concluded that \"supplemental doses of up to 3,700 mg potassium per day appear to be without overt adverse effects, but may be associated with gastrointestinal lesions diagnosed by endoscopy.\" Based on this conclusion (with no correction for uncertainty), UK EVM set 3,700 mg as the GL for potassium. It was not specified whether this GL applied to supplemental potassium or total intake from all sources. The UK EVM recognized that the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) in the UK for potassium was 3,500 mg for adults over eighteen years of age, but did not identify any estimate of average potassium intake by the population as a whole.\n\n>The clinical trial data on potassium chloride, together with the epidemiology supporting the safety of larger amounts of potassium from fruits and vegetables, indicate that this nutrient has a wide margin of safety. Clinical trials collectively show no pattern of adverse effects for supplemental potassium of 1,500 mg, with the potassium from foods being unspecified. Larger quantities of potassium as potassium chloride can produce gastrointestinal effects, and these seem more likely if the daily total is ingested all at once, especially on an empty stomach. The UK EVM established guidance indicating that 3,700 mg of potassium was safe, but did not specify the amounts for foods and supplements. The evidence that was used, however, related to supplemental potassium. Considering clinical trial evidence and the apparent safety of potassium intakes as high as 8 to 11 g per day from fruits and vegetables, CRN [the Council for Responsible Nutrition] sets its ULS [upper level for supplements] for potassium at 1,500 mg per day, with the provision that it should be divided into doses no larger than 500 mg each.^11\n\nIn 2006 the European Food Safety Authority concluded that\n\n>Potassium intakes from foods have not been associated with adverse effects in normal, healthy children and adults. The average intake in adults from the diet is 3-4 g and the intake generally does not exceed 5-6 g per day.\n\n>A long-term intake of potassium supplements as potassium chloride of about 3 g per day in addition to intakes from foods has been showed not to have adverse effects. Supplemental potassium in doses of 5-7 g/day in addition to dietary intake has in a few cases, however, been reported to cause conductive effects and compromised heart function in apparently healthy adults.\n\n>Gastrointestinal symptoms have been seen in healthy subjects taking some forms of potassium supplements, e.g. slow release, wax-matrix formulations, with doses ranging from 0.9 to 4.7 g/day or more, but incidence and severity seem to be more dependent on the formulation than on dose. Elderly people may be more vulnerable to adverse effects of potassium due to reduced physiological reserve in renal function or due to drugs affecting potassium balance. Certain other groups are also sensitive to increases in potassium intakes. These include subjects engaging in strenuous activities leading to dehydration, with impaired renal function, on cardiovascular disease drug treatment or other metabolic disorders affecting potassium homeostasis. Case reports of various adverse effects such as hyperkalaemia, conductive effects and compromised heart function have been reported in such subjects after moderate to high acute or sub-chronic intakes of potassium in the form of supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes.^12\n\nSome research has suggested that our Palaeolithic ancestors may have had just 700mg of sodium/day but 11 000mg of potassium/day!^13 But it seems getting even 4700mg every day from dietary sources can be daunting. As far as I can tell, potassium chloride is the supplement most studies examine, but some people claim that potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, or potassium gluconate are easier on their stomachs. This seems like reasonable advice to me: \"unfortunately, one of the major side effects of taking potassium is indigestion, belching, and stomach upset, which can be minimized by following a few suggestions. First, the supplement should be taken after a meal, as having something else in the stomach can protect the lining from becoming upset. It is also recommended to drink 8 ounces of water, and do not lie down for at least 30 minutes to keep it from trying to come back up the esophagus. Another suggestion is to divide the doses up throughout the day to minimize side effects. A slow release version can also help to prevent stomach upset. Slow release medications should not be crushed or chewed, but since many of them are too large to swallow easily, some are scored (have a dividing \"line\" down the middle). It can be broken across the scored area and the two halves can be taken right away, or one can be taken at the next meal.\"^14\n\n*****\n\n# **Sources**\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemia\n2. http://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx\n3. http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064928.htm\n4. http://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/potassium.cfm\n5. http://www.berkeleywellness.com/supplements/minerals/article/potassium-pills\n6. http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064894.htm\n7. http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sodium-potassium-balance/\n8. http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#h3\n9. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11794633\n10. http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#h2\n11. http://www.crnusa.org/safetypdfs/019CRNSafetyPotassium.pdf\n12. http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/ndatopics/docs/ndatolerableuil.pdf (pgs. 409–422)\n13. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet#Sodium-potassium_ratio\n14. http://www.everydayhealth.com/health-questions/potassium/is-there-a-potassium-that-does-not-cause-indigestion-and-belching\n\n*****\n\n# **TL;DR**\nWith healthy kidneys, a daily potassium supplement of up to 1500mg to 3000mg is *probably* safe, but may irritate your GI lining. Try subdividing it into smaller doses (500mg has been suggested) spread throughout the day taken after food and with a lot of water to reduce irritation.\n\nMake sure you're getting enough magnesium, which helps your body absorb potassium.\n\nPotassium values on Nutrition Labels in the US/Canada are optional in most cases. You may be underestimating your potassium intake.",

Anyone here with experience in taking adderall either to manage ADHD or as I’ve seen online to even help POTS etc.?\n\n2. How do you guys get in your electrolytes and minimize POTS symptoms?\n\n3.

I also have never heard of things affecting Adderall absorption, but I have never actually looked or even thought about it. So I am sure that I eat/drink things that might mess with it. But this is my experience anyway:\n\nI have taken both Adderall ER and Ritalin ER for ADHD as well as just general energy. I literally can not get out of bed without it. Even with it, I have very little energy, but I get by mostly (though I do not work right now, though I am starting college again this week, so we will see how that goes).\n\nI took Adderall for like 3 years? ish? I went off of it because I built up a tolerance to it and reached the maximum dose, so I switched to Ritalin maybe around 6 months ago. I have a history of building up a tolerance to psych meds really quickly or that they just have no effect (they actually had me do a DNA test (called GeneSight) that showed that I do not metabolize most psych meds correctly). So now I am on 30mg of Ritalin ER and I am trying my absolute best to stick with this dose until it is absolutely necessary for me to increase it cause I am trying to get as long as I can out of it before I build up a tolerance.\n\nOverall, I do not see it impacting my POTS negatively.

    "body": "…right as I was trying to get to sleep and my upstairs neighbor’s bass thumped. I’m lucky I remember, because it was a wonderful idea.\n\n***I split my people chow into two foods.***\n\nSee I realized that the drink tasted awful because the masa (the main ingredient) was not mixing well, and basically my drink was becoming more like a very watered-down dough than a drink. Needless to say, I didn’t even finish that batch; that’s when I began cooking it.\n\nThen I started making it into a sort of cornbread/grits type food. This would’ve been delicious doused in pancake syrup or peanut butter or some such other delicious topping, but doesn’t that sort of defeat the purpose of this “perfectly balanced” diet?\n\nSo last night, I made the decision to split the masa, and make that into a bread (it’s called “Tortilla Perfection” for a reason- tortillas are just masa and water), and mixed most of the other ingredients into a drink.\n\nThe result is (hopefully going to be, once I stop fucking up the dough) a drink that basically tastes like…vanilla? I don’t know, it tastes like vanilla and has the consistency of milk. Is vanilla milk a thing? I’m lactose intolerant, so I don’t know. And basically some tortillas.\n\nSo here’s how I did it:\n\n**Tortillas:**\n\n - 345g masa harina\n\n - 20g whey protien (I think this caused some issues today and acted like yeast. I’ll do some modifications once I get some more masa and let you know how to do it successfully)\n\n - 25g soybean oil\n\n - 4g salt\n\nNow, note I didn’t use all of the oil. That’s because I’m using 30g of it in the frying pan when I make the tortillas. It gives it a better flavour and keeps it from sticking to the pan.\n\n**Drink**\n\n - All of the GNC shit\n\n - the remaining whey protein(35g)\n\n - the Cal/Mag\n\n - I’ve been cutting the potassium citrate down to 2 or 3 grams, because there’s almost enough in just the GNC shit and I don’t want to get too much potassium\n\n - Choline (I bought tablets and I’ve been crushing them on the bottom of a beer bottle, that’s a pain in the ass)\nI stuck this in a tupperware container and shook it vigorously to mix, then added a bunch of water. It made enough to not-quite-fill a half-liter water bottle, and tasted amazing.\n**My issues today**\n\n - I ran out of masa. I ordered some more, but it won’t get here til Friday, so I’m stuck eating regular food today. My stomach is not happy.\n\n - I added too much water, so I tried boiling it off. This would’ve been fine (probably) had I not included some of the whey to help with the flavor of the drink. The whey rose, like yeast.\n\n - it’s been taking a really long time to prepare. I’ve been at it for over two hours now. It won’t take that long in the future, it’s just taking so long because I fucked up so much, but doing this definitely gets rid of the “convenience” advantage of Soylent, which I’m definitely going to have to work on.\n\n - I made a mess in my mom’s kitchen (It’s complicated as to why I’m not in my apartment tonight) I hope I don’t forget to clean anything or she’ll be pissed as hell.\n\n[source](http://mysoylentexperience.tumblr.com/post/75029806263/so-yesterday-i-had-a-stroke-of-genius)",

    "body": "The last three days I have had an issue falling asleep due to my heart beating rather hard. Not fast just thumping in my chest. I don't come from a family with any heart disease, my blood work is stellar, and I am in shape at about 220lbs with 10%bf. I train 7 days a week and I am in the best shape of my life at 35.\n\nAfter reading many posts on the keto subs it turns out this is a common phenomena that seems to be linked with electrolyte imbalances. The solutions are extremely ambiguous: too little potassium, too much potassium, take more magnesium, adjust your sodium, keep potassium and sodium in a correct ratio.\n\nWell I can tell you unequivocally last night the palpitations worsened when I took a potassium supplement. I am eating roughly 3lbs of meat and 3 eggs a day. This puts me somewhere in the 4000mg mark for the day.\n\nIf I supplement with potassium it better be after a long sauna session. Generally it needs to be accompanied by some organic honey (for you Saladino fans) or my stomach starts grumbling. Too much potassium citrate and we find ourselves on the toilet. So, I am going to rule out potassium as a culprit.\n\nI take a 400mg magnesium glycinate supplement before bed. I have never seen any need to take more than that. I may be wrong so feel free to inform me if more would be beneficial in any way and in specific for heart palpitations.\n\nAs for sodium I salt my food to taste, I take about 1.7g of Redmonds sea salt every morning and another 1.7g right before working out. If I am doing cardio that day and I have sweat buckets then I will take a third 1.7g after that workout. Measuring all this out I am taking in roughly 7-9g of sodium a day. Keep in mind I do train a lot.\n\nA couple of additional points: I have not cramped up in years especially after going carnivore.\n\nPossible issues:\n\n1 - Too much sodium (or too much sodium relative to the potassium intake)\n\n2 - I have read that this could be too little sodium (7-9g a day seems like more than enough)\n\n3 - Quite possible that I am not drinking enough water\n\nI am a little confused and I am asking for help on this matter because I have had this problem before and I remedied it. I drank more water and stopped eating soo late. I changed nothing except for the fact that my last meal is starting to creep later and later and closer to bed time. All has been well for months. Suddenly the palpitations popped up again and I am not sure what the issue is.\n\n  \nUPDATE (04/24/2024): I solved the problem and these are the changes I made\n\n1 - Ensure you avoid eating too close to bedtime (3hrs is ideal although I rarely achieve this).\n\n2 - Incorporating a glass of OJ and/or some fruit on days when I use saunas or engage in intense cardio sessions.\n\n3 - I raised my magnesium intake from 400mg to 600mg spread across two intervals. 200mg after my first meal, usually post-gym, and 400mg before bedtime.\n\n4 - Unknowingly, I was consuming overly lean red meat, resulting in a high protein to fat ratio. I have recently corrected this to achieve a balance of about 1g protein to 1g fat. This adjustment not only enhanced my mood and energy levels but also eliminated instances of experiencing heightened heartbeats before sleep.\n\n5 - Introducing 5-HTP to my sleep regimen has significantly impacted my mood and motivation. It seems likely that my body produces insufficient serotonin. 5-HTP acts as a precursor to serotonin and melatonin, which may have also contributed to reducing intense heartbeats. I recommend researching this compound thoroughly before usage. Manipulating neurotransmitters can lead to negative mental states if one does not require changes. If serotonin levels are adequate, increasing them can result in severe depression.\n\nYou presented me with a dilemma, encountering two recurring moments daily:\n\nFirstly, lying in bed at night, acutely aware of my heartbeat. This hindered my ability to sleep and sparked concerns about my health.\n\nSecondly, sporadic instances during the day while working, meditating, or idling at a red light, where I would suddenly realize the palpitations of my heart, permeating my conscious awareness.\n\nI can attest that implementing these five adjustments has had a profound impact. Which has had what magnitude of effect I cannot say. To the extent that I no longer dwell on my heart's rhythm or intensity since making these changes.",

    "body": "Electrolyte drinks can taste metallic or overly salty to some people, and this might be because of the chloride-based electrolytes used in many. If you wonder you don't like the taste of chlorides, try drinking some unflavored Pedialyte. It does have some chloride (almost all electrolyte drinks do), but all of its potassium comes from potassium citrate and about 20% of its sodium from sodium citrate.\n\n**I prefer Pedialyte, but it is really expensive, and does not come in an unflavored powder.**\n\nSome background--the WHO rehydration formula is widely considered to be the best benchmark for electrolyte drinks. The ratio of sodium to potassium has some wiggle room which depends on diet. If you tend to eat a lot of salty foods, you will want to err towards drinks with higher potassium content. If you eat tons of vegetables and/or sweat a lot e.g. more than 6 cups of vegetables per day and/or you work in construction, you can probably tolerate the higher sodium formulations.\n\nThe WHO formula calls for carbohydrate in the form of table sugar because it's readily available, but other options like dextrose can have advantages over table sugar. No matter the type of carbohydrate, the addition of some improves the uptake of electrolytes and water.\n\nAlso, it is still necessary to get some chloride. However, most people already get quite a bit from the salt in their diets, and it's also much easier to add chloride using either salt and/or commonly available potassium chloride-based salt substitutes. Finally, most electrolyte drinks contain chloride of some kind anyways.\n\nLast year I looked far and wide for options that used a majority of citrate-based electrolytes, and there wasn't much available. Chloride-based options are plentiful because it's the cheapest form of bulk electrolytes available. So if you can tolerate the taste of those, then options like Trioral, LMNT, etc are fine.\n\nNormalyte Pure is well known and does use some citrate-based electrolytes. However, all of its potassium comes from potassium chloride, and this accounts for the difference in taste between it and unflavored Pedialyte.\n\nI went down the rabbit hole of buying individual electrolytes and mixing my own, but I learned that I would have to measure each ingredient individually before mixing a batch. Combining the dry ingredients and scooping from a bulk dry mix doesn't work without extremely expensive, specialized equipment to ensure they mix uniformly.\n\nSo here's what I've found after doing another search one year later:\n\n#**Hydrant Unflavored**\n\nThis would be my top pick as it has few additives of concern for people with sensitivities. It would be even better if it had dextrose included. As with Normalyte and Trioral, ratios closely match the WHO formula, but all of its potassium comes from potassium citrate.\n\nhttps://www.drinkhydrant.com/products/unflavored - it closely mimics unflavored Pedialyte, but without the dextrose. It also has a nontrivial amount of zinc, so like with Pedialyte, you'd want to take care with more than 2 servings per day.\n\n#**Powdervitamin**\n\nThis somewhat sketchy looking brand seems like an OK option for those who eat a lot of salty foods.\n\nhttps://www.powdervitamin.com/products/unflavored-electrolytes-powder-50-servings - this brand has a lot more potassium than sodium, and you'd want to add your own salt to make the ratios more like the WHO rehydration formula. It has a small amount of zinc, less than unflavored Pedialyte, but enough to mention if you are consuming more than 4 servings per day. It also has some vitamin C, which may or may not be tolerable to you.\n\n#**K1000**\n\nI'm not a fan of mysterious 'trace mineral complexes' but if you don't mind them, it looks like a more well-established brand than Powdervitamin and has a bit fewer additives.\n\nhttps://adapted-nutrition.com/products/keto-k1000-unflavored - it is similar to 'powdervitamin' above, but with the mystery 'trace mineral complex'. \n\n#**Regenerate 24-7**\n\nAnother semi-sketchy looking brand, similar to the above two, but with more sodium. Still more potassium than the WHO ratios.\n\nhttps://www.regenerate24-7.com/hydration-1 - this also has more potassium than sodium (so you'd want to add your own salt), but it has more sodium than the above two. It also has a nontrivial amount of zinc, so like with Pedialyte, you'd want to take care with more than 2 servings per day.\n\n\n#**Noord**\n\nAn EU option for those who have difficulty getting US products. More sodium than WHO ratio.\n\nhttps://noordcode.com/products/electrolytes-unflavoured - it is a EU brand that has more sodium than potassium\n\n#**Relyte unflavored**\n\nRelatively well known, more sodium than WHO ratio.\n\nhttps://redmond.life/products/re-lyte-hydration - can't link directly to the unflavored option, but it has more sodium than potassium\n\n#**Chloride based options**\n\nThese I don't prefer, but I'm listing them here for completeness. Neither contain zinc and both have an unflavored option.\n\nTrioral is by far the cheapest and has the most chloride: https://www.triselfcare.com/collections/vendors?q=TRIORAL\n\nNormalyte is somewhere in-between Pedialyte and Trioral for chloride content: https://normalyte.com/collections/normalyte-pure-collection\n\n#**Special note on Pyridoxine HCl form of vitamin B6**\n\nIt can cause peripheral neuropathy even in small doses: https://www.tga.gov.au/news/safety-updates/peripheral-neuropathy-supplementary-vitamin-b6-pyridoxine",

    "body": "Hi.  I'm now definitely sure that I'm losing >1lb/week on my ketogenic Soylent, which I call Super Ketonic Dietary Replacement fluid, which is roughly a thousand calories of medium-chain triglyceride oil plus whey isolate plus dextrose and maltodextrin plus an unholy assortment of vitamin and mineral supplements.  There are no oats.\n\nThe main sticking points I face now, and on which I need your advice, are:\n\n1)  Magnesium.  I bought magnesium citrate powder, but adding that to the mix produced crazy amounts of foam and I fear the implied chemical reactivity.  What is a more inert form of magnesium to add?  I'm currently taking tablets but would strongly prefer fewer pills.  Target level is 600-700mg/day.\n\n2)  Sodium.  Adding salt in anything like the daily RDA makes my Dietary Replacement Fluid taste amazingly horrible.  I've been eating table salt out of the palm of my hand.  Target level is at least 600mg.\n\n3)  Chloride.  By a similar logic I can't directly add chlorine from salt, though some of that comes along from my choline chloride.  Being able to add this would also be helpful.  I think I'm supposed to be getting 1g/day.\n\n4)  Phosphorus.  This is in general a dangerous supplement to take, since it seems that calcium supplements lead to heart disease even though increased dietary calcium apparently does fine.  I'm hesitant but may end up taking my calcium in the form of hydroxylapatatite, aka bone meal, in the hopes that this will be similar to a form of calcium my ancestors ate.  This will add some phosphorus, but when I'm taking in a cautious daily dose of 600mg calcium, this will correspond to only 200mg phosphorus from this source.  Monosodium phosphate has a horrible-taste problem similar to salt.  No, I can't get it from oats.  And if someone knows a super-safe calcium source that would not go amiss either.\n\n5)  Potassium.  I can handle a teaspoon of potassium citrate, which is about 1.8g of potassium, with no problem.  Adding a tablespoon of potassium citrate, to meet the suggested minimum daily intake, makes my Dietary Replacement Fluid taste downright metallic.  Any ideas?  (Potassium chloride does not work for taste, just like salt doesn't.)\n\nMany of these issues revolve around intolerable flavors.  I have not yet experimented much with adding flavors to my DRF.  Currently I rely on the sugary taste of the dextrose, plus a quarter-cup of orange juice (containing natural fructose, ick), plus a small amount of stevia, plus squeezing in a fresh lime.  I haven't tried anything to do with chocolate or cinnamon.  Keep in mind that this stuff is primarily fat, in the form of medium-chain triglyceride oil, with a leavening of whey isolate and dextrose.  Not sure how cocoa or cinnamon would go with that, I haven't really tried so far.\n\nYour help and experience would be much appreciated.  Trying things at random is kinda expensive.",

She said if I can’t manage the large pill there is a powder you can order online that you mix into water, tea or juice that works great. It is called Litholyte.

It has many interesting references too.\n\n>**Aim:** To investigate if potassium citrate, a mild alkaline compound, can prevent metabolic acidosis in children with epilepsy treated with the ketogenic diet without reducing antiepileptic efficacy.  \n>  \n>**Method**: In this prospective controlled study, we investigated the frequency of initial uncompensated metabolic acidosis in 51 participants. There were 22 participants with and 29 without potassium citrate supplementation. The ketogenic diet was used as add-on treatment to children with drug resistant epilepsy. We also estimated the proportion of participants with a greater than 50% seizure reduction after 7 months.  \n>  \n>**Results**: None of the 22 participants (15 males, seven females; median age 1y 7mo, interquartile range \\[IQR\\] 3y 3mo) with, and 10 of 29 (12 males, 17 females; median age 6y 1mo, IQR 4y 8mo) without potassium citrate developed metabolic acidosis (odds ratio=0.04, 95% CI 0.00–0.75 \\[p<0.01\\]); median pH 7.32 vs 7.24; \\[p<0.001\\]), and median bicarbonate 19.7mmol/L vs 14.0mmol/L (p<0.001). The number of seizures was reduced by more than 50% in 9 of 22 with potassium citrate and 8 of 29 participants without potassium citrate, 7 months after introducing a ketogenic diet (p=0.4).  \n>  \n>**Interpretation**: In the ketogenic diet, potassium citrate supplementation can prevent metabolic acidosis, without reducing antiepileptic efficacy.  \n>  \n>**What this paper adds:** Citrate supplementation prevents metabolic acidosis in children treated with a ketogenic diet. Efficacy of the ketogenic diet is not affected by supplementation with citrate. Citrate supplementation does not affect beta-hydroxybuturate concentration. Potassium citrate reduces the time needed to reach an optimal ketogenic ratio.\n\nThe mechanisms are discussed here: [Acidosis and citrate: provocative interactions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6186559/).",

    "body": "Hey, \n\nSince I sometimes feel a bit weak on keto (without being low on sodium) and don't want to eat spinach all day, I wanted to supplement both potassium and magnesium. Now a few questions about that:\n\nMost people here supplement potassium with lite/nosalt. However a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/4702fk/electrolyte_supplement/d09x2lu)  here on /r/ketoscience said that too much potassium and sodium chloride could have a negative impact on your chloride balance, which could result in reduced water retention (and hence increased urinating and sweating?). \n\nFor both magnesium and potassium, I read that you should prefer the chelated forms ie citrate, gluconate etc. Potassium citrate sounds good in a way that it's absorption is pretty efficient and that it was pretty effective in reducing kidney stones, which with more spinach (oxalate) and potential uric acid/ketones competition (urate) would be nice to have. However again people said that it might interfere with ketosis and that it could be irritating on the gut lining. How are the other potassium chelates? (hydrogen carbonate, gluconate etc?) \n\nAbout magnesium supplements I really don't know anything about, could someone give a brief overview for the different types and which are preferred? \n\nFinally, when should I take those supplements, and should I take them together? Some people say that certain forms of magnesium complexes taken before bed make them sleep well, but also cause a hangover the next morning. \n\nAnyway , I would greatly appreciate if someone could give me a bit of an insight. Thanks in advance :)",

        "body": "~~Don't do gluconate unless you want extra glucose. :) (generally unwanted when eating keto.)~~ Citrate, malate, lactate and bicarbonate are great magnesium forms.  Each has additional effects becuase you get the bits hanging on to the magnesium.\n\n[Citric acid](http://www.barringtonchem.com/blog/benefits-of-citric-acid.php)\n\n[Malic acid](http://www.prohealth.com/library/showarticle.cfm?libid=16575)\n\n[Lactic acid](http://www.outsideonline.com/1801511/lactic-acid-fuels-your-brain)\n\n[Bicarbonate](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/02/02/11-health-benefits-baking-soda.aspx)\n\nAs for chloride being an issue, I haven't found that to be the case, but I've been taking MgCl for a while.  Your cells use the chloride form of magnesium directly, so taking that means you get the most absorption. (All other forms are converted by hydrochloric acid in your stomach, to different degrees, depending on how tightly the Mg is bound to the rest of the molecule.  This is why MgO, magnesium oxide, sucks as a supplement: there's a double ionic bond between the Mg and the O, harder to break.)",

        "body": "There are several ingredients in this product that could be detrimental to one's health.\n\nThere are two sweeteners listed here, sucralose and acesulfame potassium. They work synergystically to create a taste 200 times sweeter than sugar, and a chemical compound that is extremely stable (enhancing shelf life). Both sweeteners are artificial, meaning \"cooked up in a lab\".\n\nBoth are a probable detriment to human health.\n\nSucralose is the primary ingredient in Splenda. From the book Sweet Deception ... \"sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, 4-methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature. If you read the fine print on the Splenda web site, it states that \"although sucralose has a structure like sugar and a sugar-like taste, it is not natural.\"\nAlso \"The presence of chlorine is thought to be the most dangerous component of sucralose. Chlorine is considered a carcinogen and has been used in poisonous gas, disinfectants, pesticides, and plastics. The digestion and absorption of sucralose is not clear due to a lack of long-term studies on humans. The majority of studies were done on animals for short lengths of time. The alleged symptoms associated with sucralose are gastrointestinal problems (bloating, gas, diarrhea, nausea), skin irritations (rash, hives, redness, itching, swelling), wheezing, cough, runny nose, chest pains, palpitations, anxiety, anger, moods swings, depression, and itchy eyes. The only way to be sure of the safety of sucralose is to have long-term studies on humans done.\"\n\nLink to study on dangers of sucralose : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?orig_db=PubMed&db=pubmed&cmd=Search&TransSchema=title&term=Journal%20of%20toxicology%20and%20environmental%20health.%20Part%20A%5BJour%5D%20AND%202008%5Bpdat%5D%20AND%20splenda\n\n\nThe second sweetener listed in acesulfame potassium, or acesulfame K. This sweetener is considered more of a health risk than sucralose.\n\nTwo links, one with general info, and the second, a human study of artificial sweeteners including acesulfame K.\n\nhttp://blog.foodfacts.com/index.php/category/acesulfame-k/\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743508001576\n\n\n\nThe artificial sweeteners are not the only ingredients that are questionable. Blue 1, and Yellow 5, food colorants, are by-products of the petroleum industry, and are not considered to be safe to consume.\n\nAnd finally, propylene glycol is an ingredient that maintains moisture content, and is used as an emulsifier. It is essentially a food/cosmetic grade mineral oil derived from petroleum. The chemical data sheet for bulk propylene glycol warns to avoid skin contact to prevent strong skin irritation. Propylene glycol can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.\n\n\n\nSorry about the huge block o text, but you would totally be better off drinking plain, filtered water coupled with a good B spectrum vitamin, than this product.",
