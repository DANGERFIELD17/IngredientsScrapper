I used cornstarch and a stiff brush as others have mentioned and it worked pretty well.

Lots of leather has dyes added and cleaning chemicals can remove that dye with the oil and leave you with a dark oil spot with a lighter colored ring around it. \n\nThey make an oil remover for leather that is sprayed on and it foams. As it foams it pulls the oil out. It’s safest if you use it on the back side of the leather but that involves upholstery work.\n\nThis is all if it’s true suede…if it’s fake suede or ultra suede call a professional and they can most likely get it cleaned up. No guarantee though, ultra suede is basically microfiber which is a super absorbent material and strong oils can bond with it and become problematic.\n\nSource: I’ve been a fabric and floor cleaner for over 20 years",

    "body": "# PREFACE\n\nMy old go-to western cleanser was reformulated a few years ago and I've embarked on a quest for the perfect cleanser. While I haven't found my ultimate HG, I've had some interesting experiences: some good, some not so good... These are all the cleansers I've used this year.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I try to be as honest as possible with my reviews. That said, my skin is *extremely* reactive and my ratings reflect that. YMMV! - I should also mention that although I'll be describing scents, all the products I've listed are fragrance free, with a maximum of one essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SKIN TYPE:** Combo leaning oily. \n\n* **Proclivities:** Sensitive with mild rosacea, often dehydrated, and breakout-prone.\n* **Sensitivities:** Shea Butter, Fragrance, Essential Oils, and often Niacinamide. \n* **Climate:** Southeastern Canada, “humid continental”. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CURRENT ROUTINE:**\n\n* DEAR, KLAIRS Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil (PM)\n* ISNTREE Green Tea Fresh Cleanser (AM/PM)\n* (non-AB) PAULA’S CHOICE 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (PM, twice weekly)\n* COSRX Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner (AM/PM)\n* COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (AM/PM)\n* ETUDE HOUSE SoonJung 10-Free Moist Emulsion (AM/PM)\n* ILLIYOON Ceramide ATO Concentrate Cream (PM, often)\n* (non-AB) EUCERIN Aquaphor Healing Ointment (PM, sometimes)\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Water Fit Sun Serum (AM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WATER-BASED CLEANSERS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CETAPHIL Gentle Skin Cleanser - OG** (non-AB)\n\n* **Price:** \\~$8 for 500ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate 😳\n* **Used For:** \\~10 years\n* **Scent:** Doctor’s Office\n* **Wash Sensation:** Uninspired\n* **Finish:** Untouched\n* **User Experience:** The hideous bottle, clinical scent, and uh… boyish texture make this an utterly joyless cleansing experience. But it’s as cheap as I am. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Gentle, non-drying, and doesn’t do a great job of cleansing, but TBH that’s often what I *want*. The best western cleanser I’ve tried, and my \"HG\" for many years, because sometimes you just need something that doesn't ruin your skin. **4/5**\n* **RATING: 6/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CETAPHIL Gentle Skin Cleanser - Reformulation** (non-AB)\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 500ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Niacinamide 😒\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Hospital\n* **Wash Sensation:** Disappointed\n* **Finish:** Irritated & Itchy\n* **User Experience:** Same as above, but it smells much worse and stings on contact. **1/5**\n* **Effects:** With the added “benefit” of the niacinamide, this felt similar to the original, but more drying. It also provides a long lasting itch and a slight flush! **1/5**\n* **RATING: 1/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ROUND LAB - Mugwort Calming Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$15 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Mugwort Extracts 🧐, Sage Oil 😒, Green Tea Extract 🥰, Allantoin 🥰, Madecassoside 🥰, Panthenol 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Irish-Spring-But-Herbal\n* **Wash Sensation:** Slightly Attacked\n* **Finish:** Very Dry\n* **User Experience:** I was curious to try for the mugwort scent, but found it bland and soapy. This does a great job of cleansing, and creates buckets of foam that get into every orifice on my face. Probably not the best choice for my first foaming cleanser after a decade+ of only using milky gels. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Holy drying, Batman! I tried to convince myself that I just needed to get used to foam, but no. Just no. **1/5**\n* **RATING: 3/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ROUND LAB - 1025 Dokdo Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Chamomile Oil 😒, Hyaluronic Acid 💦, Ceramide NP 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~1 month\n* **Scent:** Chamomile & Plastic\n* **Wash Sensation:** Fluffy\n* **Finish:** Slightly Dry / Slightly Filmy\n* **User Experience:** Smells neutral yet slightly plasticky with a hint of chamomile. I found this vastly more pleasant to use. Same as above: literal pea sized amount = foam for days, but it gets extra points for the less offensive scent. Also the little seal on the bottle fills me with joy and I'm simple that way. **3/5**\n* **Effects:** This is much gentler than and not as drying as the Mugwort, but it also leaves a moisturizing film that I don’t like. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 5/10 WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISNTREE - Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$18 for 220ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Yam Root Extract 🧐,  Oat Meal Extract 🙃\n* **Used For:** \\~a few days\n* **Scent:** Unsweetened Taro Bubble Tea\n* **Wash Sensation:** Creamy & Surprised\n* **Finish:** Liberally Buttered\n* **User Experience:** This has such a beautiful creamy scent. It would have been a gentle, soothing experience if my face didn’t just EAT IT UP. I tried using this on both wet and dry skin, but no matter what, my skin was hungry for yam. This alarmed me... Not what I want from a cleanser. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** I often have good luck with products for dry skin because I’m sensitive, but this was a good reminder that *I do, in fact, have oily skin*. Despite this cleanser instantly absorbing into my skin, it also left a thick moisturizing film that broke me out nearly instantaneously. **1/5**\n* **RATING: 3/10 WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BEAUTY OF JOSEON - Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$11 for 100ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Green Tea Extract 🥰, so many plant extracts 😒\n* **Used For:** \\~2 weeks\n* **Scent:** Heavenly Bittersweet Plum\n* **Wash Sensation:** Completely Delighted\n* **Finish:** Very Moisturized\n* **User Experience:** The best smelling cleanser I’ve ever used. This has a sweet and fruity scent with an intriguingly sour edge. It’s a fun, goopy gel that creates an extremely tight and luxurious foam. It feels so modern and innovative!. Plus the package is utterly beautiful. **5/5**\n* **Effects:** This is so gentle and leaves my skin feeling extremely moisturized, while doing a better job of cleansing than a western milky gel. But in less than a week it gave me hella whiteheads. I continued to use it for a further week because I was in denial. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 7/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ETUDE HOUSE - SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Madecassoside 🥰, Green Tea Extract 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~2 weeks\n* **Scent:** Grassy Almond Water\n* **Wash Sensation:** Soft & Velvety\n* **Finish:** Untouched\n* **User Experience:** The best foaming cleanser I’ve ever tried. This has the same soothing grassy almond milk scent as the rest of the SoonJung line with just a touch of plastic. One pump creates the perfect amount of silky foam. Small gripe: despite how gentle this is, it gives me a lil eye sting. **4/5**\n* **Effects:** Does an excellent job of cleansing without being stripping, breaking me out, or leaving a film, but I also don’t find it hydrating or moisturizing - it’s just neutral. If someone's looking for a replacement for their bland western cleanser, this would be my top recommendation. That said, it might be a touch too drying for a twice-daily cleanse.  **4/5**\n* **RATING: 8/10 - MRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISNTREE - Green Tea Fresh Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$17 for 120ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Green Tea Leaf Powder 🥰, Green Tea Leaves 😒, Green Tea Extract 🥰, Hyaluronic Acid 💦\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Hot Green Tea\n* **Wash Sensation:** Refreshed\n* **Finish:** Untouched & Hydrated\n* **User Experience:** The packaging doesn’t thrill me, but this is a lovely gel that creates a loose, barely-there foam. It smells delightful, and even though I can't use anything with fragrance, I love a good scent. This cleanser smells like a freshly-brewed hot cup of over-steeped green tea. It also has tiny leaves in it that mostly evaporate on contact, but I’ll occasionally get a bigger chunk and have to fish it out because I can’t deal with any amount of physical exfoliation. **4/5**\n* **Effects:** This is so gentle without being overbearingly moisturizing. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated even if I don’t apply additional hydration immediately afterwards. - This would absolutely be HG if not for the leaves, and I would highly recommend it to all but the driest of the dry skinned people. **5/5**\n* **RATING: 9/10 - WRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FIRST CLEANSERS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BIODERMA - Sensibio Micellar Cleansing Water** (non-AB)\n\n**Price:** \\~$15 for 250ml (IIRC)\n\n* **Notable Ingredients:** Cucumber Fruit Extract 🙃\n* **Used For:** \\~5 years\n* **Scent:** Clinical Water\n* **Wash Sensation:** Cautious & Afraid\n* **Finish:** Sad & Soapy\n* **User Experience:** Apparently, even the finest Shiseido cotton pads are too exfoliating for my skin. This does a fine job of removing makeup and sunscreen, but I really don’t find this that gentle (possibly because of the friction with the cotton pads). - I know I’m in the minority here, but rosacea-prone skin really do be like that. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Okay as a first cleanse, but if I use this on its own it breaks me out like crazy, even if I rinse it off. This makes me nervous to use it in general, and I'd rather just use an oil cleanser so I'm not wasting cotton pads. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 4/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DEAR KLAIRS - Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$22 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Sunflower Seed Oil 😐, Grape Seed Oil 😐, Jojoba Seed Oil 😐, Black Currant Seed Oil 😐\n* **Used For:** \\~8 months\n* **Scent:** Absolutely Neutral\n* **Wash Sensation:** Dubious\n* **Finish:** Slightly Tight\n* **User Experience:** I’ve technically been oil cleansing for \\~20 years because my childhood friend’s dad was a clown and taught me the way. That said, this is my first *actual* oil cleanser, and it's obviously miles ahead of well... food. - This smells like nothing, glides smoothly over my skin, and emulsifies instantly, but it could be gentler. **3/5**\n* **Effects:** The longer I use this, the less I like it. At first it worked wonderfully, but after many months it feels more drying with every use. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 5/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISO: a new oil cleanser!** Thinking of trying either the Muji Mild Cleansing Oil or Peach & Lily Ginger Melt, but LMK if you have any suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[MANY EDITS: Mostly formatting, extra details, etc.\\]",

For cleansing oils, if you haven't tried it I'd tentatively recommend Purito's From Green Cleansing Oil - it's been a long time since I've used it (I get too excited and want to try every product out there), but when I used it my skin barrier was terribly damaged and it was still really gentle, never stung etc. If you want to try another foam cleanser, I'd recommend the Real Barrier cream cleansing foam - I got mine at a great discount (StyleKorean, $9.90 for 220ml) and it's a nice balance between cream and foam cleansers imo! We seem to have similar skin types so I think this would work well for you in the fall/winter, though it does contain some essential oils so I'd tread carefully!",

I currently am enjoying the Fancl Mild Cleansing Oil. Some other ones that interest me that seem to maybe be gentle are the Peach & Lily Ginger Melt (as you suggested), and the Krave Beauty",

I'm also the same as you, but more on the dehydrated prone skin issue. Anything drying will wrecked my skin.

    "body": "I grew up in a desert where the UV index is extremely high for much of the year, so I take sun protection seriously- fortunately I have never had skin cancer but I have had severe sunburns that were absolutely awful. So as much as I despise wearing sunscreen on my face, I do it, because I understand that it’s necessary. \n\nAll that to say that it really annoys me that the skincare industry exploits the current cultural obsession with “anti aging” to push sunscreen on people - not because I don’t want people to wear sunscreen, I do- but because the agenda behind pushing facial sunscreen use has nothing to do with public health and everything to do with making a profit, and the end result is that people are slowly starting to see sunscreen as a beauty item, not as a preventative health measure. And companies are charging such absurd prices for facial sunscreens that people are just not going to buy them at all or will buy them but not use nearly enough to actually be effective. \n\nWhat prompted this rant? A free sample I received from Dr Few skincare of their tinted mineral sunscreen. I tried it, and it was nice, so I went to their website to look into it more and discovered it is currently $85 for 1.6 ounces. EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS. For a zinc oxide sunscreen. And to justify the price, the company isn’t trying to convince you that it protects you from sun damage better (I mean zinc oxide is zinc oxide, there’s nothing innovative there), but it calls out the cosmetic part of the formula - specifically hyaluronic aid and jojoba seed oil - to convince you to buy it because it has hydrating ingredients in it. \n\nTo me this isn’t even trying to pretend they care about sun protection, this company is just being more transparent than most about how they see an opportunity to make money off of sunscreen. And you cannot tell me that there are people out there who would buy a sunscreen at these crazy prices and actually use it with the proper amount and frequency to actually protect themselves from the sun. I would bet money that most users put a layer on in the morning then maybe slap makeup over it and don’t think about it for the rest of the day. \n\nFor the record, I’m not picking on this particular company, my criticism holds true for most brands out there. I think people are starting to push back though - I watched a recent Dr Dray video where she reviewed a couple of new Elta MD sunscreens and there were many comments pushing back on the $52 price tag there. \n",

It relies primarily on zinc:\n\n>Active Ingredient: Zinc Oxide 25% Inactive Ingredients: Water, Sodium Phytate, Polyglyceryl-4 Olivate / Polyicinoleate, Shea Butter, Coco Caprylate / Caprate, Caprilyc / Capric Triglyceride, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl 2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lecithin, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bisabolol, Tocopherol.\n\nI am all for marketing sunscreen as an anti-aging product if it gets people to wear it. Photodamage is very real, and sunscreen does protect your skin from photodamage. And I don't mind paying a lot for a good sunscreen without a white cast and which protects my skin. I would actually spend this much on a perfect sunscreen. I am brown, and finding a mineral sunscreen that didn't make me look like a ghost was unbelievably difficult. And since sunscreen tops off everything, I would gladly pay for one that looks really nice on my skin. \n\nBut I do not see anything in this sunscreen that justifies the price tag. I also agree with Dray about the cost of eltamd's sunscreen. It is nothing special, and eltamd is riding on that \"medical-grade skincare\" horse. Honestly, I wouldn't even call this Dr. Few a sunscreen. It is just a moisturizer with zinc. Looks pretty moisturizing, though.",

    "body": "Hi friends! I was over at r/tretinoin and saw a shared post on how sunblock inhibits blocks UV ([original thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/jf7k06/psa_this_is_how_important_spf_is/)). People were commenting on how the model in the video missed the neck, chest, and under eyes. And then I realized, \"wait a minute, I don't put sunscreen on my lips...\" Further wake-up via the thread on r/SkincareAddiction that unprotected lip can also lead to skin cancer ([thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8q4vvd/psa_remember_to_use_sunscreen_on_your_lips/)). Hence the search for AB lip product with SPF.\n\nI searched within AB for product suggestions on this topic but most of the discussion threads seemed to be from 4-5 years ago. So I went on to hunt for some Japanese AB lip care products with SPF. I'm here to share my findings!\n\n**Edit:** I've added to the product info whether if the company test on animal (cruelty-free)!! Fortunately, all five companies don't conduct the tests!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things to note:**\n\n* I can't find a conclusive study or expert suggestions on how much SPF there should be for lip products ([doc here says \"15 or higher\"](https://www.prevention.com/beauty/skin-care/g26934681/best-lip-balm-with-spf/), [another says \"30 or above\"](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lip-balms-spf-protection)). I know SPF 30 is the rule of thumb for face and body, but I only found THREE products with AB lip care products with SPF 30 or higher in my search so far. I used SPF 25 as a cut off point for my list below.\n* All products should be in production (hence listing official company pages below).\n* I haven't tried any of these products, so I can't comment outside of the product specs given.\n* I have ZERO affiliation with the brands below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Product info given below:**\n\n1.

It doesn’t sit on my lips nor does it feel heavy. And I see positive changes to my lips - more plump and moisturized! It does come off easily so I have to reapply every 2-3 hours but it’s not an issue for me \n\nOverall I would see it as a staple in my routine :)",

I know I have sensitive acne prone skin.  but it is often dry and flakey.  the only time I get oily is when I am wearing makeup, which I do very often. I think I might have hormonal acne, because I will break out with hard cystic acne a couple of weeks out of the month, then it will calm down after my monthly cycle ends.  \n\nother problems: I get very bad cystic acne deep in my skin. I usually only get these on my chin or around my mouth, but I have recently gotten a couple of the left side of face on my upper cheeks.  I have large pores the are constantly clogged.  I have these weird small bumps that look like they are filled with gunk but are hard to pop.  i also have clogged pore looking things that i can squeeze and a never ending noodle of puss will come out (sorry to be so gross im just trying to explain what i deal with) not to mention little white heads here and there.  but most the the problems are around my mouth/lips and on the apples of my cheeks/around my nose area\n\nwhat ive tried to do: first of all let me say i cant afford to go to a derm, but i am not opposed to seeing an esthetician if it is affordable.  i have been using aveeno clear complexion foaming face wash to wash my face, makeup removing cloths before i wash, then i use face moisturizer.  but i have just started using OCM with castor oil and avocado oil.  I have done A TON of research on this before i started so Im almost positive im doing it right BUT i got a HUGE HARD cyst on my chin the day after starting :(\n\nother products i may use:\nlush's celestial moisturizer,\nLUSH enchanted eye cream,\nolay day time moisturizer,\nwitch hazel (not often),\nst ives exfoliating pads (2x a week),\ni also don't use towels to dry my face i let it air dry and pat some of the water with my hands\n\ni have also used a couple of other products that i actually really like, but im not sure if they are doing my face any good, or actually may be causing some of my problems. i will list the product, how i use it, and the ingredients because they are lesser known:\n\nOSEA ADVANCED PROTECTION CREAM: I use this at night before bed after i wash my face, before i put moisturizer on...\nits supposed to even hyper pigmentation, fine lines, and stimulate collagen production:\nINGREDIENTS: aqua, algae extract*, dipalmitoyl, hydroxproline, coco caprylate/caprate, cetearyl glucoside, olive, glycerin*, aloe barbadensis leaf juice*, macadamia seed oil*, grape seed oil*, jojoba seed oil*, capryloyl glycin, vitamin E, avacodo oil*, chondrus crispus*, undecylenoyl glycin, glycine, calendula officinalis flower extract, anthemis nobilis flower extract*, potassium ascorbyl tocopheryl phosphate (natural vitamin C), citrus medicalimonum peel oil*, xanthan gum, sodium benzodate, potassium sorbate (*certified organic) ( 100% natural derived ingredients) \n\nOSEAS red algae mask: HG mask for me at the moment. when i have a cystic acne break out it soothes my face and helps ease the pain and i always feel like my acne is less inflamed and my skin has a slight glow after using this. i use this 1x a week but not every week...\nINGREDIENTS:  red algae gel extract, glycerin, corrective oil complex, cocoglucoside and coconut alcohol, sodium lauroyl oat amino acid, French red clay, frech pink clay, magnesium aluminum, silicate, cahadian willowbark extract, multifruit extract, sesame oil. jojoba oil, sodium magnesium aspartate, water lily extract, chamomile extract, red wine extract, lactic acid, vitamin e, calendula extract, greentea extract, grapefruit seed extract, xanthan gum, phenoxyetanol\n\ni also have a face lotion that i use on my infant son, and i was wondering if i could use it as a gentle face lotion:\nnatures baby face and body lotion:\ningredients:\norganic aloe barbadenis leaf juice, safflower seed oil, ethylhexyl palminate (from coconut), glycerl stearate, sorbitan olivate, shea butter, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, olive fruit oil, jojoba seed oil, glycerin, rosa centifolia flower water, natural vitamin E, cellulose gum, xanthan gum, organic comfrey extract, organic chamomilla matricaria flower extract, organic calendula flower extract, amino acid, amino acids, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, glycine, citric acid\n\n\n\nso that's it! any help/advice/words will be very appreciated !\n\nthanks for reading.

It might be worth it to at least get a consultation with a derm (some do that for free), get some recommendations/samples, and then ask your GP to prescribe you things. I generally am pretty against recommending Accutane, but I think it's worth it for people who have that sort of painful, deep cystic acne, especially if it's causing you a lot of emotional distress. I have no idea if a GP can prescribe Accutane, though.\n\nI notice you said you have an infant son. Were you on any kind of birth control before you had him? Have you ever been on birth control? Cystic acne is frequently related to hormones. Can you see an OB/GYN? They would at least be able to talk to you about that, and if you are ok with going on birth control or other hormonal meds, that might help.\n\nI agree with what most other commenters are saying, though. Drop the multitude of heavily fragranced Lush products and start over from scratch with some gentle products like CeraVe and maybe some oils. Seeing an esthetician might be worth it just so someone can see your skin and guide you through treating it irl, but don't let anyone try to sell you miracle products.

In the event that you do ever get health insurance, I highly recommend seeing a dermatologist.\n\nAfter 10 years of dealing with cystic acne, my doctor referred me to a dermatologist and he prescribed Accutane.  After just 5 days on the medication, I felt like I was looking at another person in the mirror.  I can not tell you how happy I was after the 6 month course of that drug.  It was time-consuming process and there were a lot of restrictions.  You had to have blood work done regularly before you could get your new prescription for the month and you had to call to \"certify\" in order to pick up your prescription, etc.  It's a very expensive process if you don't have insurance.  I think the medication alone (without insurance), was around $300 per month.  It was the only thing that worked for me.  I ended up going through two more courses of the treatment, each time a lower dose/shorter period of time.  I probably didn't need the two other courses of treatment, but I got paranoid that it was going to come back all over again and I had a very understanding doctor.

Obviously when you see the derm, just reiterate that you don't have insurance and you would just like to work out the least expensive option at this point that will still be effective. The derm should be able to give you quite a few free samples as well :-) I know for me personally, nothing besides the medicine would have helped with my acne because it was hormone related (due to PCOS) so I needed the androgen blocker in spiro in order to clear it up. After the initial skin-freakout, which was a bitch, my skin cleared right up and I haven't had another breakout since. I still get pimples, but they are always small and not cysts. \n\nI no longer take the spiro because I don't feel that I need it, but my current routine includes the following:\n\n1. Cerave foaming cleanser wash stuff\n\n2. Cerave moisturizer in the tub\n\n3. Alpha hydrox oil-free formula (aha) - several times per week\n\n4.

My skin has changed for the better by removing all processed food and sugar (this includes eating out), becoming gluten free, and removing all dairy products from my diet.

I also started taking more vitamins since I am vegan and it is hard to get all the necessary fatty acids and nutrients I was once getting from fish and meat. R-Lipoic Acid, EPA-DHA, evening primrose oil (great to help balance your hormones) and a multivitamin containing iron. I saw my skin change again in about 3 months. As far as OCM, I have been using sunflower oil which I read somewhere is good for acne prone/combination skin. \n\nNow, this might not work for you but it's important to look at all options when you're trying to clear up your skin. And drink lots of water, I mean TONS! It will make a big difference in your skin as well. And if you smoke, stop smoking! And please, stop picking!

Like the Pixi one it’s mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, “sweet scented geranium”(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn’t sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to “not have pH” (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn’t buy the Pixi version as it’s still £17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around.

    "body": "I was on Sephora.com last week about to order some Kat Von D makeup removing wipes (I was hoping to find something that would take off waterproof everything and I recall the sample of hers doing the trick, as in being ridiculously oily.) when I came across something brand new: [Urban Decay's Makeup Removing Wipes](http://www.sephora.com/meltdown-makeup-remover-wipes-P409954?skuId=1850403&icid2=D=c6:products%20grid:p409954). I can literally not find these anywhere else, not a review, nothing. Or at least I couldn't prior to Friday. I was trying to find an ingredient list before ordering, but it was as though they did not exist other than the listing on Sephora.com to buy.  Since they were really reasonably priced (ETA: reasonable by Sephora standards.) and you get 100 wipes in the pack, I figured what the hell. I seem to have no self control when it comes to anything makeup related and just buy it like it's nothin'. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/b2kCl2Z\n\nThey arrived today and even though it's only 530 pm, and I really don't normally take my makeup off this early so as not to scare small children or offend their sensibilities (my niece has some pretty strong opinions about me going out without makeup on: she \"doesn't prefer it.\") I could not wait to test them out and see if they worked better than the [Aveeno ones](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5600049)  (shit, yo, Ulta charges way more, get em at Target or Drugstore.com or something!) I'd been using or if they burned any less. (FYI--they still burn but not as badly, but I have ridiculously sensitive skin, plus retinoids. So, everything burns.) \n\n\n\n*Sizing, and about the wipe:*\n\nThe sheets themselves are bit smaller (6.5\" x 4.5\") than the Aveeno ones (7.4\" x7.2\" per the package, so a little over 7\" square), but compared to the Aveeno ones were slightly damper--not as wet as I would like though and not as wet as I recall the Aveeno ones being in the past--and certainly not as damp as the Simple Micellar Wipes are.  I've had several packs of Aveeno ones that have been really dry lately from the start, and dried out before the pack was even half done. \n\nThe wipes themselves are texturally similar. The Aveeno ones are slightly thicker, and stronger than the UD ones, but the UD ones are labeled as biodegradable. \n\nA used UD wipe:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tcuMw6M\n\n\n\n*Efficacy/Usage:*\n\nI usually use one Aveeno wipe (out of a 25 wipe pack) at a time, and that will take off most or all of my waterproof eye makeup (yknow, assuming it is wet enough) and then will go over my whole face with one of the Simple Micellar wipes to make sure any oiliness is gone. There are still times where I don't get all of the eye makeup off, because I pile it on. Often what is left is mascara, and I either give up, or will go over my lashes with another wipe OR use one of the Ocusoft scrub pads to get it off. \n\nI felt due to the size of the Urban Decay wipes that I needed two. I probably didn't, but for the sake of comfort, I did use two. Given that 100 come in the pack, even if I use two at a time, I will still get twice as much out of this pack assuming it doesn't dry out before I run out.  I still used the Simple wipe afterward, because again, oily.  I did not really have anything left on my eyes or lashes afterwards, and didn't feel like I needed to go over my lashes or eyes at all. There might be a tiny bit of something still on there, but not enough that I feel like I need to worry about it. I'd go to bed like this.   Tonight I have boxing, so I will still shower, so I don't care--I'll be washing my face again.\n\nBefore/After photos, try not to have nightmares:\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/P4MOMdb\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/qmJiPAq\n\nA:  http://imgur.com/1BbCxIF\n\n\n\n*Pricing:*\n\nThe price difference is significant, but I felt worthwhile.  The Aveeno wipes are around $6.99 (at Target) for a pack of 25. The Urban Decay were $20 for a pack of 100. So basically to get as many Aveeno wipes as UD wipes, you'd pay $27.96 assuming you didn't find them on sale/coupon deal. Though, I guess considering you're using two UD wipes, it's really half that, so $13.98, given I need one Aveeno for every two UD wipes (need...maybe. Used, yes.) And again, that assumes the Aveeno ones are not dried out. \n\n\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\nI took a photo of the package, it's not great. \nhttp://imgur.com/Gqw4mWc\n\nList is:\n\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Gluconolactone, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Sunflower Seed Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Olive Oil, Lavender Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Calcium Gluconate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Chloride, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopheryl, Malic Acid, Sunflower Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract\n\n\nBut this product has five natural oils in it, vs none in the Aveeno.  Here's the list from Ulta on the Aveeno:\n\nWater, Isononyl Isononanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Isostearyl Palmitate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-6, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Sucrose Cocoate, Fragrance, Carbomer, PEG-4 Laurate, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Chrysanthemum Parthenium(Feverfew) Flower/Leaf/Stem Juice, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Glycerin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract.  The package says there's a 3 month shelf life, which I think given the ingredient list is interesting, though, it's heavy on the natural oils, and maybe they're less stable?  Compared to the Aveeno list, it's significantly more natural. \n\n\n\n*Bottom Line:*\n\nI am pretty impressed after one use. I will see how I feel after several more. I want to see if they dry out and how quickly they dry out if they do.   But efficacy in the first use made them worth my while. \n\nedited to correct stupid typo\n\n\n**24 hours later update:**\n\nI just did my second use today and I was able to use ONE wipe this time (well that was my requirement of myself this time), and it worked just fine, both eyes completely clean. I followed with the Simple Micellar wipe all over and briefly around my eyes, bec I am just that anal, and my face is spiffy.  Then I just applied my serums and all that after like normal.  *Fingers crossed* that my face doesn't lose it's marbles with all the natural oils. ",

And [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)'s a link to my last post, where I speak to some of the products that I skip mentioning here.\n\n**Product reviews**\n\n* **iS Clinical Active Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is my HG exfoliant. It's the perfect strength for my skin. p50 was perfect before I started using retinoids (although I never tried the lower strengths), but this formula is the perfect formula to purify my oily T-zone while not causing irritation on dry-tending cheeks.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* Either in the AM or PM, every other day (alternating with a retinoid). I use 5 drops on face and neck, applied with my hands on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of common suspects: glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol. None of these are terrible worth going into, although super sensitive folks may have trouble with the alcohol denat.\n      * Arbutin: skin-lightening ingredient that [works differently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632348/) than Vit C or licorice, so their effects can be complementary.\n      * Salix Alba (willow) bark extract: natural source of salicylic acid.\n      * Saccharum Officinarum Extract: natural source of glycolic acid.\n      * Bilberry extract: blueberry-like fruit with soothing and anti-aging properties. It's a [strong antioxidant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vaccinium-myrtillus-fruit-extract.html) due to the anthocyanins in the fruit (which give the skin its dark blue color).\n      * Polyporus Umbellatus Extract: source of kojic acid, which has skin brightening properties. It is also antimicrobial, according to the iS Clinical [website](https://isclinical.com/ingredient/view/index/id/5778).\n      * Menthol: this one is controversial. It's listed as an irritant, and I certainly don't want to dispute that. I also know that menthol is used in a wide variety of formulas (e.g., IcyHot), so I think it's worth trying and maybe backing off if you have trouble. \n* **Tata Harper Superkind Softening Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* It feels like washing your face with floral honey, and it really does calm the skin. A 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 125mL\n   * *How I use it:* Everyday once (try to minimize since it's pricey). In the shower and rinse. Sometimes on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * A powerful suite of emollients (which I'm OK with as an oily-combo skin type since it's a cream cleanser): evening primrose oil, apple seed oil, castor oil, jojoba seed oil, squalane, grape seed oil, and sunflower oil. Note these are all mid-low comedogenicity.\n      * Lactic acid serves as a very gentle exfoliant, although % is not listed.\n      * Olivem 1000, which is a combo of ingredients used to emulsify the formula. However, Olivem 1000 puts the products into a liquid crystal structure, which is supposed to absorb into the skin with increased efficacy. *To look for Olivem 1000 in a product, look for Sorbitan Olivate and Cetearyl Olivate.*\n      * Soothers in this formula are abundant (hence \"Superkind\"): prickly pear, calendula (#1 ingredient), and chamomile are the stars.\n      * Magnolia extract is another ingredient worth mentioning in this formula: it's a popular addition [for Nivea](https://www.nivea.com.au/advice/skin/magnolia-extract) as well. It has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and softening effects.\n      * There are a number of natural surfactants (it is a cleanser after all): decyl glucoside, and shea butter glycerides as the primary ones.\n      * As for all of Tata Harper's products (that I know of): there is fragrance. If you're super sensitive, proceed with caution.\n* **Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix and is loaded with natural goodies in classic Tata fashion. It works well with the resurfacing mask, and is an effective formula for increased shine and deeper subsequent product penetration.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 120mL\n   * *How I use it:* Twice a week, once with the resurfacing mask (see below for details).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix: physical exfoliants include kaolin clay, apricot seed powder, and rice extract. These are quite small and I have found to be pleasant as a compounding abrasive agent. For chemical exfoliants, we have Salix Alba extract and pomegranate enzyme.\n      * Some more under the radar ingredients: Olivem 1000, radish root extract, superoxide dismutase, which is an effective antioxidant for protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS). \n      * Aloe juice is near the top of the list and is soothing (as we know).\n      * Plenty of other good emollients in this formula as well (sunflower seed oil, olive oil). \n      * Lots of powerful fruit extracts in here, too (classic Tata): elderberry extract, alfalfa, and meadowsweet are the major ones. These are mostly antioxidant and antimicrobial actors in the formula.\n      * There are a few potential irritants in this formula, so maybe try the small size first to see if it agrees with your skin.\n* **Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% 5/5** There are only 5 ingredients in this formula, with AA as one of them. It's a good alternative for me vs. SC CE Ferulic since it's less comedogenic. It will oxidize quickly (as I've heard) so I usually keep this in the fridge. Retro-fitting a pump (vs. dropper) is a good idea, too. It smells good, too. It's $94 for 1oz. I use it after cleansing in the AM.\n* **EltaMD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 5/5** Enough has been written about this brand and formula, so I'm not going to dive deep here. That said, it's physical/chemical and broad spectrum, has niacinamide, lactic acid, and is oil-free. It's a great option for sensitive, acne-prone skin. The tint was too obvious for my skin, so I prefer the clear version.\n* **Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* If you have very oily skin, I would maybe avoid this formula. There are a number of somewhat comedogenic oils, but it may still be worth a try as comedogenicity is not always 1:1. It's a gorgeous formula and truly unique. My skin is oily-combo, and it works (and smells) like a charm. 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $130 for 1.7 fl oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it everyday during my morning routine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Same idea as the mask. I can't speak to everything in this…you'd have to be a cosmetic botanist to do that…\n      * A number of interesting oils in this formula which tend to not be comedogenic: sandalwood oil, squalane, apple seed oil, evening primrose oil, sea buckthorn oil. Sandalwood oil is high in Ximenynic acid, [which is a potent anti-inflammatory agent](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Detail/1777/556915/Pure-Australian-Sandalwood-Seed-Oil). Evening primrose has a lot of [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well](https://www.byrdie.com/evening-primrose-oil-for-skin-5215964), although it falls in the middle of the comedogenicity rating. Sea Buckthorn oil is also an-\"it\" oil recently. It's also high in antioxidants incl. vit C., regulates sebum production, has antimicrobial properties, and obviously moisturizes ([source](https://www.byrdie.com/sea-buckthorn-oil-5210082)). Since this is a formula for blemish-prone skin, the formula is sebum-conscious. That said, if you have very oily skin, I would test before committing to the full bottle.\n      * Lots of soothing agents in here: Aloe, calendula, lactobacillus ferment, arnica, multiple types of HA, tremella extract (mushroom with outstanding humectant properties).\n      * The antioxidants in this formula are powerful (including the oils mentioned above): borage leaf extract, Tasmanian pepper extract, fermented bamboo, sea fern extract. \n      * As far as anti-acne agents, Zinc + Salix Alba bark extract are the main factors. \n      * There's also Alpha-Glucan oligosaccharide, which is [supposed to be](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/2510/74697/BioEcolia) beneficial for the skin microbiome.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel:** **5/5**\n   * *Summary:* So this serum is a go-to for me as someone with combination skin that tends toward redness. A 100% RP. 5/5.\n   * *Cost:* $78 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* The serum is something I put up to augment any active I use, and I love it for that reason. It’s hydrating, calming, and smells good, and it ultimately is the most frequently used product in my routine. \n   * *Ingredients:* There are a number of interesting ingredients in this formula: \n      * Olea Europaea Leaf Extract is olive leaf extract, and it’s shown some promise in [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333467/) study (although it’s a small group, not double blind or randomized, and technically doesn’t meet statistical significance thresholds). That said, PC has [great things to say](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-olea-europaea-leaf-extract.html). Major benefits are improvement in skin texture, some photoprotection, and antioxidant properties (high in catechin and rutin, both bioflavonoids). \n      * There’s also cucumber fruit extract, which has moisturizing (no surprise, it’s 95% water), antioxidant (some Ascorbic Acid, some flavonoids), and conditioning properties. Cucumber is one of the rare instances of a non-sensitizing fragrance. \n      * This formula also has grapefruit extract and thyme extract — consensus from outside SkinCeuticals seems light to mid on both of these. \n      * The formula has a small amount of Morus Bombycis Root Extract, which is derived from mulberry and has arbutin in it, which as we know is good for skin lightening as it’s a hydroquinone derivative. \n      * There are a few icks in this formula (fragrance, linalool, etc.), but overall I have found it to be very calming and pleasant. \n* **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Sleepair Intensive Mask 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a thick, non-comedogenic formula with intense soothing effects. It will likely pill, but it's intended for night use, so that shouldn't be an issue. I prefer this to the SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque. Will RP.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 110mL\n   * *How I use it:* I only use this for irritated skin, which it promptly resolves over night.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * As far as moisturizing factors, this product has over ten humectants: propanediol, glycerin, trehalose being the highest on the ingredient list\n      * There are a smaller number of emollients: only true oil being moringa seed oil, which is far down the ingredient list. Point being: *this product is thick but has not been comedogenic in my experience.*\n      * The real power of this product is in the soothing ingredients it offers: gotu kola (cica) being the featured #1. Gotu Kola contains a number of active compounds, including madecassoside, which has been shown to work as a [wound-healing agent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18503551/), an [anti-hyperpigmentation agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290557/), and a soothing ingredient [potentially effective](https://www.seppic.com/en/clean-moisture-lotion-as40140a) for atopic dermatitis (eczema). There are more soothing agents in this formula—without listing them all, suffice it say that Dr. Jart+'s chemists know what they're doing.\n      * There is also Niacinamide, Curcumin extract, Adenosine, Cacao seed extract, and other antioxidant ingredients for a nourishing blend.\n* **CeraVe SA Cream for Rough and Bumpy Skin 5/5** \n   * Summary: It's a standard (not lux) product which is effective for KP. It works.\n   * Cost:\n   * How I use it: I use it on the body (esp. on the thighs). 2x/day.\n   * Ingredients:\n      * It's a thick formula (lots of ceramides, corn oil, paraffin, mineral oil, cholesterol), but it's interestingly not comedogenic (also because it's indicated for body use vs. face). \n      * In terms of actives, we have lactate, vit E, salicylic acid, niacinamide, and phytosphingosine.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* A multi-tasking superformula with growth factors derived from human fibroblasts. It's very expensive, and it's something that I don't think I will repurchase (not because it doesn't work) but because anti-aging isn't my #1 priority. While my skin is young, I'm focused on anti-acne and hyperpigmentation, but for folks who want to improve collagen and elastin production, this is it.\n   * *Cost:* $295 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* After microneedling at home, once or twice a week. \n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * TNS (total nutrient system): this is a medium that is harvested from propagated human fibroblasts. This medium is rich in nutrients and signaling compounds that trigger collagen and elastin production.\n      * Lots of other goodies: peptide complexes such as whey, lactococcus ferment, algae extract, usual suspects for humectants, fruit extracts such as apple and grape, pullulan, lecithin (for creating liposomes which deliver actives deeper into the skin).\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel: 5/5 — with caution**\n   * *Summary:* This is a strong cleanser and should only be used for folks with oily skin. It has a cooling effect, which is pleasant, but the combination of actives in this is no joke. If you have really congested, clogged pores, I would recommend it. It's cheap enough, and strong enough, that I only need a bit and can use it as a semi-regular purge. It's an RP for me.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 240mL\n   * *How I use it:* I usually only use it in my T-zone, leave it on for no more than 3 minutes and rinse.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Sodium Laureth Sulfate: Chief Bubble Officer. [Less irritating](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12641575/) than Sodium *Lauryl* Sulfate.\n      * Glycolic acid: most researched and effective AHA. We know this sloughs off the top layer of dead skin cells. \n      * Salicylic acid (SA): an HG for acne treatment. Is lipid soluble so it can penetrate more deeply into the sebaceous gland and provide a better decongesting effect. This is in addition to exfoliating properties acting at the skin surface (although inferior to glycolic in that respect).\n      * Capryolyl Salicylic acid (LHA): this is a compound developed by L'Oreal to be a more lipophilic version of SA, providing better penetration. The study is from 2007 and 100% sponsored by L'Oreal but you can read it [here](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(06)03022-2/fulltext) if you're interested. There is some hubbub about pregnancy safety; do your own research on that front if that's applicable to you.\n      * Menthol: provides a nice cooling but can be sensitizing. [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-menthol.html) is pretty adamant against it, but I don't really give it too much stead. They cite pretty old research. I don't think my skin has been sensitized from it. There is [some newer evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620938/) of it promoting wound healing.\n      * [Sorbitol](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-sorbitol.html): A sugar substitute that acts as a humectant. Interestingly, it can also act as a prebiotic. Certain bacteria on your skin can convert sorbitol into beta-glucan, which calms the skin. Beta-glucan is partially responsible for the calming effect of oats and seaweed\n* **PCA Clearskin Lightweight Moisturizer:** **4/5**\n   * *Summary:* Overall, I find this product to be hydrating and non-offensive. To be honest, I don't know that it surpasses my OG in this category (non-comedogenic moisturizer) which is Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel. Although, if you need something more emollient than that, this is a very good option.\n   * *Cost:* $57 for 1.7oz\n   * *How I use it:* This is a good option for night time for those with oily skin. It might be too thick to put under an occlusive sunscreen during the day esp. if you run oily. Otherwise, daytime fine, too.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Ethylhexyl Isononanoate (say that 5 times fast) is the primary emollient here, and to be honest I can’t find much in the way of research on this compound. That said, I really trust PCA because your ingredients must really be top notch if you’re going to have the most bland packaging known to man. Murad and EltaMD also seem to be fans of it, which is a good sign. There are a number of other emollients, preservatives, and viscosity controlling agents which are probably not worth mentioning (they're pretty inert as far as those go). \n      * Borage seed oil has a comedogenicity rating of 2 (out of 5, 5 being instant pimple) and is very high in GLA (gamma linolenic acid) which [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-gamma-linolenic-acid-gla.html) considers to be a \"best\" rating. There is some good consensus that it has skin regulating properties (eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, etc.). \n      * Other calming ingredients: aloe, calendula, cucumber, chamomile (bisabolol). Has glycerin as well (although not too much). \n      * There is retinyl palmitate, which is a bit confusing to me, to be honest. If you're making a moisturizer for oily skin, I don't know why you would include one of the least active forms of vitamin A. \n* **SkinMedica HA5 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I think this is probably a miracle product if you have deep wrinkles. The five different types of HA are going to sit on various levels of the dermis, provide different hydration profiles, and sustain moisture in different ways. For me, as a younger person without deep wrinkles, it's nice but not worth the $ for me right now.\n   * *Cost:* $184 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Usually replaces a proper (?) moisturizer during daytime for me and put sunscreen on over.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * 5 types of HA. I'm not going to go through them, but there is crosslinked (bigger HA, which sits on top of skin cuz there's no way it's penetrating any deeper), hydrolyzed (smaller version but SkinMedica doesn't give the weight so hard to say exactly where it's going to land in the skin), plus the regular HA. I actually see 3 obvious HAs in the ingredients, not 5. Someone help.\n      * Texturizing compounds (HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Cross-p, polymethylsilsesquioxane) which give it a really nice slip feel\n      * Pullulan (mentioned this [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)) but this is the compound that tightens the skin and is used to create the Listerine sheets.\n      * Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape seed), which [PC loves](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vitis-vinifera-grape-seed-extract.html). It's antioxidant containing and many of them at that (resveratrol, anthocyanins, flavonoids, etc.)\n      * Vibrio alginolyticus ferment filtrate: This is actually a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, but this is obviously not a live form of it. Hard to find a lot of info on it, but[ it seems like](https://trulux.com.au/products/vibrio-alginolyticus-ferment-filtrate#:~:text=Vibrio%20Alginolyticus%20Ferment%20Filtrate)%20organizes,exopolysaccharide%20synthesized%20by%20kopara%20microorganisms.) it claims to be helpful in epidermal organization. \n      * Porphyridium cruentum extract which is a red algae derivative that has zeaxanthin, which is in the vitamin A family and has photoprotective properties. Jury seems to be out on efficacy.\n      * Moisturizing factors: Serine, Urea, Trehalose. Urea is interesting because it does have a function in rejuvenation (by breaking down a protein called filaggrin which helps organize the keratin in the skin at the top layer). This is thought to free up amino acids in the ECM.\n      * Skin communication ingredients: Whey protein, Plankton extract\n* **Tata Harper Repairative Moisturizer 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's not for me since my skin is oily, but it's a fab product if you're OK with emollients and fragrance (very well harvested and preserved via pump).\n   * *Cost:* \n   * *How I use it:* Since my skin is oily/combo, I don't often use this to be honest. This would be perfect for daily use for dry skin types or those that can get away with a product that gives some more shine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Simply too many to list. Check them out [here](https://incidecoder.com/products/tata-harper-repairative-moisturiser). \n* **SkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream: 4/5** Also not going to go super in depth here. TNS is the same as mentioned above, but this formula is a lot cheaper and has a much more emollient feel. I only use it post-procedure. Will RP when I have another procedure (esp. microneedling or Morpheus).\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 4/5** Not going to say a whole lot here. But I did figure out that the Vit E in this way causing some closed comedones, so I had to stop using it on the face. Won't be RP for that reason.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream: 4/5** Want to revise the record and say that I do believe this broke me out a few times on the face. Great for dry areas on the body, eczema, or post-procedure. Not great for face if oily.\n* **SkinCeuticals AGE Eye Complex:** **4/5 since I am 26 and advanced glycation end products probably not a huge issue for me**\n   * *Summary:* I wrote a review of this in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/), and I don’t think much has changed, although I do think that I can effectively minimize any irritation from this product with applying a small amount. I’ve taken a deeper dive into some of the ingredients. \n   * *How I use it:* Just a little bit below the eyes in the morning\n   * *Cost:* $105 for 15mL\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * First off, like 7/10 first ingredients are about viscosity and skin-feel and that definitely comes through when you apply the product. It’s hard in the jar but slips on the face very nicely. This is also good for ensuring it lasts a long time. \n      * There are also a number of compounds that scatter light such as Nylon-12, reducing the appearance of fine lines. \n      * It also obviously features Pro-Xylane (thanks L’Oreal). I tried to find some independent research on this (and [this](https://www.wcd2019milan-dl.org/abstract-book/documents/late-breaking-abstracts/45-wound-healing/proxylane-a-plant-sugar-derivative-9.pdf) is the closest I could find). Basically L’Oreal claims that it helps restore the ECM (extracellular matrix, which is where collagen, elastin, and many of the other things responsible for skin appearance lie). \n      * We also have Ascorbyl Glucoside (AG) in this formula, which makes sense regarding skin firmness and lightening. Jury is still out on in-vivo skin penetration of AG but it does create a reservoir of Vit C in the skin because it takes time for it to be converted into ascorbic acid (AA). \n      * There is caffeine in this formula as well, which we know is an antioxidant and helps with circulation.\n      * There is some UV protection from titanium dioxide. \n      * There’s also Hesperdin Methyl Chalcone which is derived from citrus and has blood vessel protecting properties. It’s at minimum an antioxidant and at maximum can help reduce dark circles due to its effect on vasculature. \n      * There’s anthocyanins in the form of bilberry extract but it’s far down on the ingredients so who knows how impactful that is. \n      * There are also a number of peptides in this formula which should help contribute to a firming effect. \n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a cult favorite from an iconic brand in the Green Beauty space. \n   * *Cost:* $68 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I use this once a week with the Regenerating Cleanser ([as Tata suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfrVxpoG_Nw)), which I use on dry skin and then layer with this mask. Leave on for 5 minutes, rinse, and my face feels great.\n   * *Ingredients:* If I had to write a complete summary of ingredients for all of her products, we'd be here all day & I would hit the word limit. So I'm going for an abridged approach.\n      * The primary active in this product is Salix Alba Bark Extract (willow bark) which is a natural BHA source. \n      * Despite being a resurfacing mask, there are a number of effective soothing complexes in this formula, namely 2 types of aloe. You could argue that Beet Root is a soother as well, although it's primarily a source of antioxidants and functions as a humectant.\n      * There is lactobacillus ferment, which Estee Lauder introduced in 2009 as a DNA repair enzyme and an antioxidant. There's also pomegranate enzyme which is extract using lactobacillus, although this functions more as an exfoliant.\n      * Radish Root Extract, which you'll find in Dr. Barbara Strum products + some (all?) versions of p50. This works both as a preservative in the formula but also as an antimicrobial on the skin.\n      * Kaolin clay — a gentler alternative to Bentonite which work as a mild abrasive and oil-wicking agent.\n      * Note there are a number of irritants in this product, so if you're sensitive to fragrance, be cautious.\n* **Maya Chia The Straight A Gentle Retinol Treatment 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I used this for 2 weeks. For the first week, my skin had a glow like no other. For the second week, I broke out. It's comedogenic for folks with more oily-type skin.\n   * *Cost:* $125 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night, after cleansing and a serum (optional).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of strong emollients which are plant derived and serve double duty as antioxidants as well: Chia seed oil, Rose hip oil, Raspberry seed oil, Buriti oil, Sunflower seed oil, Vitamin E\n      * Encapsulated retinol optimizes the retinol delivery system into the skin, and keeps it fresh for longer\n      * Natural retinol alternatives: Moth bean extract and bakuchiol which promote cell turnover (retinol's main mechanism of action)\n      * Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THDA) is a form of vit C which has [shown promise](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate) but is less proven than straight up AA. \n* **Neocutis Lumiere Firm Eye Cream 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I really like this eye cream and I might RP. I love the pump, and I love the packaging. It does make a difference and my sensitive eyes tolerate it well. I wonder if it has been slightly too thick for my oily skin even though the eyes and cheeks run drier.\n   * *Cost:* $108 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* In eye area (not above) once a day, very small amount gently rubbed in\n   * *Ingredients:* Not going to go into too much detail here: it has caffeine, vit C (as THDA, AA, and ascorbyl palmitate), beech tree bud extract, lecithin, HA, licorice extract for brightening, peptides, growth factors, and chamomile. It's a multi-pronged formula with a lot of promise and gentle but effective actives.\n* **Consonant Hydrextreme 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is an excellent humectant product. It's very simple. I will not be RPing at this time because it's a bit too simple for me + feels like it doesn't go as far as some of the other options in this space.\n   * *Cost:* $112 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* After actives, before moisturizer, with wet hands.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Glycerin: it's probably the least offensive and most popular humectant. You probably already know it :). This is a high concentration formula that is not tacky or sticky.\n      * Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide: this is a plant sugar with emollient properties and is a good source of antioxidants ([source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-cassia-angustifolia-seed-polysaccharide.html)).\n* **Aveeno Tone and Texture Renewing Night Cream 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's a good product. The PHA exfoliant is not quite strong enough for my KP so I will not be RPing, but it's a good choice if you have more sensitive skin on the body.\n   * *Cost:* $10 for 8oz on Amazon\n   * *How I use it:* On the body, roughly twice a week.\n   * *Ingredients:* I love the way that Aveeno breaks down the ingredients so see [here](https://www.aveeno.com/products/tone-texture-gentle-renewing-night-cream) if you're curious.\n* **Tata Harper Body Revitalizing Oil 3/5** Not going to do a deep dive here. The ingredients are quality, but it's too small of an amount for the price (considering that it goes on the body so you need much more).\n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Body Serum 3/5** Same thing here. It's a fabulous formula but it's way too expensive for how much you'd need to use on the body. The bottle might give you 15 uses on the full body, which is just hard to justify.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a calming masque and SC claims it decreases your skin surface temperature by something like 5 degrees (ok). It's been sitting almost full in my cabinet for a while — it's nice but won't RP unless it's for post-procedure for something majorly irritating (phenol peel?).\n   * *Cost:* $66 for 60mL\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never lol. Would be great for post procedure.\n   * *Ingredients:* There is not a whole lot of extra detail to add here as compared with the gel described above. There are a few additional ingredients that are worth mentioning: Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester is a dipeptide that has skin calming and fibroblast protecting properties (PC agrees but [here's](https://www.activepeptide.com/product/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester/) the link to buy it raw if you want to experiment yourself yikes).\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It is confused about what it is and who it's for. I don't understand why there's so much more bilberry extract than exfoliants. I understand that these can be irritating products, but it feels like SM is putting the cart before the horse here. It should exfoliate first and foremost, and for me, it doesn't. No RP.\n   * *Cost:* $48 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never. It's probably fine to use morning and night, but depends on your face + wear SPF always but esp. in the AM if using AHAs.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of Bilberry extract (2nd ingredient)\n      * Moisturizing/calming: Aloe, Glycerin, Squalane, Chamomile (2 types), B5\n      * Natural AHAs: Sugar Cane Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract. To me, these are not astringent enough to be effective. Perhaps it's the rest of the moisturizer and emollience of the rest of the formula, but I just don't feel that this sloughs off the dead skin in the way that I want it to.\n      * There's also BHA (Salicylic acid), Vit E, and Vit C (as ascorbyl palmitate). Like I said — confused.\n* **Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay 2/5** Not going to go in depth here. I don't think I'll ever \\*have\\* to RP (since it's huge), but I don't think I would. It's very good for removing sebaceous filaments and pulling oil from the skin. It's a bit strong, but it's a good option if you struggle with oil control.\n* **Avene Eau Thermale 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's just water. \n   * *Cost:* $20\n   * *How I use it:* On my face\n   * *Ingredients:* Mineral water. Be careful — it's pH 7.5. If you put this on immediately after any actives that require a narrow pH range (e.g., AA, AHAs/BHAs), you are going to inactivate them. \n* **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask: 1/5** Not going to go in depth here. Will not RP. It works but so does Aquaphor.\n* **Darphin Intral Inner Youth Serum 1/5**\n   * *Summary:* No change noticed during 2 months of use. Fragrance is a bit sickly-sweet. Will not RP.\n   * *Cost:* $50 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night after an irritating product (retinoid or exfoliant).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Chief function of the serum is soothing: it has panthenol, chamomile, and Alteromonas ferment (which is used across the cosmetics industry as a soothing agent).\n      * There is moisturizing action here, too: glycerin, glycosaminoglycans, castor oil (low comedogenicity). This is obvious from the serum nature of the formula, but it's certain not a moisturizer in and of itself.\n      * Peony extract is one of the chief ingredients and scents. Cannot find anything about the benefits of this.\n\nIn the queue next for me: is Clinical Cleansing Complex, Herbivore's Nova and Bakuchiol, Chebula Serum by True Botanicals, SkinCeuticals Retexturing Activator, Glytone Brightening Cleansing Powder, and UltraCeuticals Vitamin A serum, Vivier V-Stat Scar Gel — any experiences or thoughts are welcome!!",

It smells plasticky to me.\n\n-1 point for the weird waxy feeling of this crea on my skin. \n\nBesides for that, this cream is absolutely perfect. Its moisturizing, its thick, and its occlusive. It took me 2 years to finish this because I really disliked the waxy feeling when I first started using it so I stopped for about 6 months. Then I came back to it and have been using it consistently once a day before sleeping. \n\nBesides for the discontinued Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask, this is a good moisturizer for my very dry skin; skin so dry that it would flakes off in small pieces during the winter months if I dont apply moisturizer. \n\nWorks great under makeup for me, but it may be because I have dry skin so it gets absorbed in quickly. However I could imagine that makeup would be slippy on top on a layer of cream if your skin is less dry than mine. \n\nRight now Im exploring other creams to find my holy grail but if I cant find anything, I would fall back on this one. \n\nMy ranking of best moisturizer for my dry skin: \n\n1. Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask. (Discontinued)\n\n2. Etude Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream (od version-discontinued). This one was slightly less moisturizing, but it beats the Kikumasamune one for being scentless and came in an easy squeeze tube. \n\n3. Kikumasamune Sake Cream\n\n4. Illyoon Ceramide Ato Cream. Nice squeeze tube. Tube is really wide though. No scent. Non-fussy. \n\n5. Laneige Cica sleeping mask. Pleasant scent. Jar. Less moisturizing than the above 3 but has a nice calming effect thats helpful in the summertime. \n\n6. Hanyul Rice cream. Perfumed rice scent. Great moisturizer. Bouncy cream texture. More expensive than most of the other ones on this list. \n\n7. Hanyul Pure Artemisia cream. Lovely calming cream. Really similar to the Laneige cica cream. Pricier than the other products on this list. \n\n8. Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Sleeping mask. Great daytime moisturizer. Too much ginseng breaks me out though.  ",

    "body": "DISCLAIMER: I am just a beginner in make-up, but I'll do my best to do describe it in detail! (TLDR at the end!)\n\nHello everyone! So I have the Cuco Hydrating Lip Tint in the shade Rosy Whisper, and it is my second tint (first one is Romand Juicy Lasting Tint in Bare Grape). First impression, ang gaganda ng shades nila, especially the Tender Fig. After swatching some lip tints in Watsons (on my arm), I decided to buy Cuco, mainly because of its staining power. We used wet wipes kasi to wipe off the tints we swatched after around 20 minutes, and yung nag-stain talaga ay yung Cuco and Peripera Ink Mood Glowy Tint. \n\n*(I don't remember lang if alin sa Cuco and Peripera yung mas nag-stain, pero parang Cuco ata since yan yung una naming napansin ng cousin ko.)*\n\nIt claims na it is infused with hydrating actives, such as:\n- Glycerin\n- Squalene\n- Jojoba Seed Oil\n\nPlus, it is:\n- Vegan\n- Paraben-free\n- Cruelty-free\n\nAnyway, here are my observations (mainly talking about the shade I have):\n\n**Color:** The color is really nice! Even though I have two-toned lips, Rosy Whisper looks flattering on me (cool-toned) and noong nakita ako ng mother ko ay nagandahan siya sa shade and gloss. Once you reapply the lip tint, nagbi-build up yung color and it looks better the more you stack it up. HOWEVER, I observed that the color darkens a bit after a while (see picture 4), so take note on that!\n\n**Pigmentation:** Tama lang yung pigment, not too light/sheer and not too pigmented. Note nga lang yung sinabi ko above na medyo nag-darken siya after a while.\n\n**Gloss:** The gloss is also nice, though not as glossy as lip glosses (duh). After around 2 hours sa labas without drinking and eating, the gloss is still there. Syempre expect na mawawala rin after a while, lalo na if may contact with food/water.\n\n**Stain:** The stain is a bit of the darker version of the tint when you first swatched it (note that I observed this on my LIPS, not on my arm swatch), and I think it's because nag-darken nga ng kaunti yung color after a while, though the color looks pretty pa rin (see pic 5). Pero syempre after eating, medyo nawawala na rin (I ate oily food). The stain also doesn't settle on the lines of my lips even though I didn't apply a lip balm before, kumbaga even siya sa buong lips.\n\n**Texture:** I observed na medyo balm-y siya when you apply sa lips, like when you slide the lips together. It feels something like a lip balm and lip oil/gloss? Pero I don't mind it naman, just something I observed. Also, it's not sticky on the lips na may nagfo-form na webs(?) when you smack your lips.\n\n**Fragrance:** Ito yung sa tingin ko na ma-o-off yung iba. It has fragrance yes, pero hindi naman unpleasant yung smell. The thing though is once you apply it sa lips, medyo malalasahan mo siya. Yung fragrance niya kasi is not sweet/dessert-like, but fragrance na pabango-ish? Kaya yung lasa niya rin is parang ganun hahaha. I don't mind it much though.\n\n**Others:** After removing it, my lips still feel moisturized, mainly because of the ingredients stated above. Compared to Romand's Juicy Lasting Tint, hindi nagbalat yung labi ko after a few hours. Pansin ko kasi sa Romand ay nagda-dry yung lips ko kahit naglagay ako ng lip balm prior.\n\n**TLDR:**\n- Great color and variety of shades\n- Rosy Whisper is flattering on two-toned lips (I'm cool-toned)\n- Color darkens a bit overtime, hence the stain is a darker version of the fresh swatch \n- Pigmentation is just right, as well as the gloss\n- Stain doesn't settle on the lines of my lips\n- Not sticky; doesn't form webs when you smack your lips\n- Fragrance may turn off other people since you can also taste it (not like the sweet/dessert types, but something more like perfumes)\n- Lips feel moisturized after removing it and it doesn't make my lips dry/crack, unlike Romand's Juicy Lasting Tint\n\nSo that's the end! I apologize if hindi niyo masyado maintindihan (my first time reviewing a product) and hindi kasi ako maalam masyado sa terms as a beginner hahahaha. Didn't expect it to be kinda long as well. Wala kasi akong mahanap na post regarding this product and comparison sana with Peripera Ink Mood Glowy Tint since I also plan on buying it. If you have any questions, please let me know!\n",

I hope I've followed all the rules!\n\nHere is the deal:\n\nSo, I have been on the hunt for a daily mist that does more than just \"this makes my skin so hydrated throughout the day!\" That's nice and all, however the reality is: It **should be** hydrating as I'm literally spraying my face and saturating it with liquid. In most of the more famous \"thermal water\" mists, its literally just water and pressure.\n\n\n**a note** I'm not bashing water mists, I own one! I think they are great for what their purpose is, pure hydration. I just find it easier to put some bottles water in a fine mist spray bottle, tbh.\n\n\n**So, what are you getting at here?**\n\nI have skin that (like many of us here) isn't flawless, spotless perfection. So I have been on the hunt for a mist that does more than simply hydrate, be cause we all deserve a mist that can help us with skin problems too, right? I think that some of the issue is, when looking for a mist, we all just assume that **hydration is all we are supposed to get from a mist** & that just didn't sit right with me. I feel like we should at least get a little bit more. Whitening/brightening effects, acne control, sebum control, pore minimizer, etc. I wan't all a mist has to offer!\n\n\n**You said you were on a hunt, did you find anything? Or are you just smack talking?**\n\nThis is why I'm here. I found a few mists that I would like to share and hope to get some recommendations for more! I hope to compile some type of list, so any and all suggestions are welcome. I would especially love some mists from brands that we may not see that often because I'd love to broaden my horizons!\n\n\n**Here are the mists I found so far and their ingredients:** (I hope anyone can add to this)\n\n\n**BENTON Honest TT Mist**\n\nIngredients: Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tee Tree) Leaf Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Altharea Roea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Poly Glutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Psidium Guajava Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract\n\n\n**ELENSILIA Escargot Botanic Garden Bee Venom Lavender Mist**\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Sodium Citrate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil,Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Chlorphenesin, Adenosine, Magnesium Sulfate, Citric Acid, Glycosaminoglycans, Bee Venom, Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Polygonum Multiflorum Root Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Phellinus, Linteus Extract, Angelica Gigas Root Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Paeonia Lactiflora Root Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Galactomyces, Ferment Filtrate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil\n\n\n**Snail White SYN-AKE Mist**\n\nIngredients: Snail secretion filtrate,deionized water, SYN-AKE (dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzalymide diacetate) Alpha arbutin, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Morus nigra fruit extract, rubus idaeus (raspberry extract) Prunus Avium (sweet cherry extract) fragaria vesca (strawberry fruit extract\n\nHonorable mention: I have **TFS Bamboo Water, sebum control mist.** I like it, it controls some oil, hydrates and doesn't have a strong scent. All around, a good buy and I use it occasionally. I can't find the ingredients for it and the bottle I have is in korean.\n\n**Elizavecca Hell-Pore Water Up Peptide EGF Mist One Button**\n\nThis is tough to find ingredients for but I have a summary thanks to u/Perpetuallydrifting\n\nFormulated with Squalane, western flower rose watercollagen, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil and humectants that moisturize and leave skin dewy, it's also infused with a adenosine, niacinamide Complex that supports Whitening and wrinkles.\n\n**MISSHA First Treatment Essence Mist** rec'd by u/snailslimeandbeespit\n\nIngredients: Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Propanediol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Niacinamide, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Betaine, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Beta Vulgars (Beet) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Cornus Officinaus Fruit Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgars Extract, Cassia Alata Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Trethylehexanoin, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Peg-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Raffinose, Polyquaternium-51, Water (Aqua), Tromethamine, Lactobacillus Ferment, Adenosine, Ethylhexyglycerin, Acetic Acid, Lactic Acid, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**DIY Mist of Holy Snails Snowbang Essence** rec'd by u/snailslimeandbeespit (decanted into a fine mist sprayer)\n\nIngredients: Ingredients: Distilled Water, (Abronia Villosa Leaf Extract, Agave Americana Stem Extract, Blue Lotus Extract, Calendula Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomile Extract, Evening Primrose Root Extract, Fouqueria Splendens Stem Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Ginseng Extract, Goji Berry Extract, Green Tea Extract, Helichrysum Extract, Hibiscus Extract, Horse Chestnut Extract, Iris Florentina Extract, Licorice Root Extract, Mushroom Extract, Pumpkin Seed Extract, Opuntia Coccinellifera Flower Extract, Yucca Brevifolia Root Extract), Hydrolyzed Oats, (Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthum Gum), Glycerin, (Water, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Wasabi Root Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Garlic Bulb Extract), (Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methyparaben, Propylparaben), Disodium EDTA \n\n(Non-AB) **MARIO BADESCU Facial Spray With Aloe, Herb and Rosewater** rec'd by u/margotmargot11 and u/scaperoute\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water, Eau), Propylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Rosa Canina Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Leaf Extract, Fucus Vesiculosus Extract, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Parfum (Fragrance), Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Citronellol, Geraniol, CI 17200 (Red 33), CI 42090 (Blue 1).\n\n**Nature Republic Bee Venom Mist** rec'd by u/mamukizzy\n\nIngredients taken from NR site: Water, Macadamia ternifolia seed oil, glacier water, bee venom, honey extract, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, salicyclic acid, butylene glycol, citrus nobilis (mandarin orange) fruit extract, gardenia florida fruit extract, angelica archangelica leaf extract, houttuyniacordata extract, acoruscalamus root extract, foeniculumvulgare (fennel) fruit cindiumofficinale root extract, chamomillarecucita *matricaria) flower extract, viscum album (mistletoe) extract, camellia japonica flower extract, peg-60 hydrogenated castor oil, tocopheryl acetate, phenoxyethanol, 1,2-hexanediol, caprylyl glycol, tropolone, disodium edta, oleaeuropea (olive) furit oil, canangaodorata flower oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil, lavandulaangustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, pinussylvestris leaf oil (tea tree) leaf oil\n\n**A small note:** Please let me know if you want me to add websites and prices.

It's probably the most finely-misted spray I've ever come across for anything though, but the issue with that is that it's *so fine* that it requires me to spray it continuously around my face for a good 5 seconds to get a good layer on, instead of just a few spritzes.

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

My HG moisturizer is hard to come across, as it’s constantly in and out of stock and not really talked about.\n\nMy skin is oily, dehydrated, sensitive, triggered by fungal acne triggers (if they are high up on the ingredient list), very sensitive with redness and acne-prone, generally clog-prone. \n\n\n\nI had finally found ONE moisturizer in the past decade that suited my needs perfectly, the Cell Fusion C Calming Down Cream. \n\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Methylpropanediol, Methyl Trimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Algae Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Turmeric Extract, Malt Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Kudzu Root Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Chlorella Minutissima Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Oat Kernel Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Artichoke Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Extract, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Titanium Dioxide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Allantoin, Sucrose Stearate, Fructooligosaccharides, Stearic Acid, Methyl Diisopropyl Propionamide, Aluminium Oxide, Beta-Glucan, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyquaternium-51, Squalane, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Maltodextrin, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Cholesteryl Macadamiate, Palmitic Acid, Guaiazulene, Saccharide Isomerate, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Fragrance, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n\n\n\nBeautiful texture, green color which cancels redness and leaves a blurred finish, locks in moisture without clogging.\nHeavy esters or triglycerides and fatty alcohols which would trigger breakouts for me are far down the list, diluted in a lightweight base (lightweight emollients such as Methylpropanediol, methyl trimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol; all good because my skin does not like heavier silicones like Dimethicone in higher concentrations.)\n\n\nPlus all the soothing ingredients like Centella components, chamomile, guiazulene, mandecassoside etc. \n\n\n\nIs there anything at all out there that has a similar structure or performs similarly? It’s so frustrating when the one product you would use religiously is seemingly irreplaceable…\n\nProducts that haven’t worked:\n\ndr g blemish cream (due to silicones)\niunik centella gel cream, isntree aloe vera gel, beplain cicaful calming gel (I think gels aren’t really for me, they make me itchy and don’t calm my skin enough)\n\n",

    "body": "I was on the search for the perfect fragrance free oil/balm cleanser for quite some time. I love to do double cleanse to make sure I remove all the sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of first cleansers/cleansing balms so I thought I would do a quick review here for anyone who is interested. My standards when it comes to a good cleansing balm/oil: fragrance-free, effective, but gentle on the skin, doesn’t over-dry the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone.\n\nAll the products I buy and review here completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing, potentially irritating plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus). So here we go:\n\n**Versed Gentle Cycle Hydrating Milky Cleanser:**  **•**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water/Aqua/EauOlea Europaea (Olive) Fruit OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed OilPropanediolVitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed OilGlycerinCaprylic/Capric TriglycerideMusa Sapientum (Banana) ExtractMagnesium Aluminum SilicateLactobacillus Ferment LysateSclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed OilAvena Sativa (Oat) Kernel ExtractRubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit ExtractLeuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment FiltrateTocopherolCitric AcidSodium Lauroyl SarcosinateXanthan GumEthylhexylglycerinSodium BenzoatePotassium SorbateSodium Hydroxide\n\n**My thought:** This product has a milky texture that is easy to use, effective and also gentle on the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes, but there are a few things to note: 1/ It doesn’t spread very far on the skin so you have to use quite a lot of product to cover the entire face so the bottle doesn’t last very long. 2/Even though the product is fragrance free, there’s a light banana scent due to the banana extract in the formula. So if you’re not fond of the banana smell, you might not like it.  Overall, it’s a great , gentle formula and one that I might repurchase.\n\n**Updated review (11/10/22): I recently repurchased this product again and noticed there are little grainy particles like sand in the product. I'm not sure what they did to the product but my sensitive skin can't tolerate scrubs or any physical exfoliant so I won't be using or repurchase this product again.**\n\n**Good Molecule Instant Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polyethylene, PEG-8 Isostearate, 1,2-hexanediol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Citric Acid.\n\n**My thought:** This product used to be only available in the scented version (loaded with potentially irritating essential oils), but due to customer demand, they decided to make a fragrance free version (thank you very much). I’m not sure if the scented version is still out there, so make sure you check the ingredients carefully before purchasing. This product come in a tub with a small spatula that you can use to scoop up the product. I do like this cleansing balm, I think it’s very effective and a little goes a long way. You don’t need to use much to cleanse the entire face. It’s also gentle enough to use around my eyes without any irritation. One con I can think of about this product is the smell. Even though it’s fragrance free, it has a chemical smell that is quite strong which I guess comes from one of the raw ingredients in the formula (though I’m not sure which one exactly). I think some people might find it unpleasant, but it’s still better than adding fragrance or essential oils.\n\n**The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Laurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**My thought:** This product has a cream texture that is quite thick coming out of the tube, and once it’s on the skin, it does require a lot of massaging, then the texture changes to oil as you work it in. Even though it’s gentle on the skin, I find it a lot less effective than other products on this list. This is not a product I would recommend for someone that wears a lot of makeup or doesn’t like to take a long time removing makeup at the end of the day. Even if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, I think there are better products out there. Personally, I wouldn’t repurchase it because: 1/It requires too much rubbing and effort to make it work. 2/I find it does irritate my eyes a little. 3/you have to use a lot of product to cleanse the entire face and the tube doesn’t last very long.\n\n**The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n**My thought:** This product comes in a tube, similar to the packaging of the ordinary squalene cleanser, but the texture is different. It comes out of the tube like petrolatum jelly. Because it’s quite thick, it doesn’t spread very far, so you have to use quite a lot of product to cleanse the entire face. It’s gentle on the skin and eyes, and leave my skin very soft afterward, but I think it will not work well for someone that wear a lot of makeup. I consider myself a minimal makeup wearer and this product couldn’t remove my eyeshadow completely. I also notice that the texture of the cleanser is not completely smooth, it’s slightly grainy due to the small pieces of oat which I do not like. I will not be repurchasing this product.\n\n**Jordan Samuel Skin The After Show Treatment Cleanser for Sensitive Skin:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Aqua/Water, Sucrose Laurate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobiliss Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**My thought:** This has to be the worse balm cleanser I have ever tried. It has a jelly-like texture coming out of the tube, and it goes on the skin just fine, but it just doesn’t cleanse off when I rinse my face with water. It barely remove makeup and leaves my face with a layer of residue that feels oily. I feel like I have to follow up with another cleanser right away or risk breaking out. I hate wasting product but I couldn’t make myself use this one so I threw it out after trying a few times. Sadly, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbeth-30 Tetraisostearate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olive Fruit Oil, Water, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate (Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), Jojoba Seed Oil, Ceresin, Dextrin Palmitate/Ethylhexanoate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, BHT\n\n**My thought:** this product is a very popular Japanese cleansing oil, and for a good reason. It’s affordable, cleanses quickly and effectively, without leaving any residue behind. 2 pumps are what needed to cleanse my entire face. If you’re someone that wear a lot of makeup and need something that can remove make up fast and effortlessly, you will love this product. Some cons about this product: 1/ it can bother my eyes sometimes if I get it too close to the eyes. I thought i just throw this out there in case anyone has super sensitive eyes. 2/ It might be hard to get in in store. You have to order it online and it might take some time to arrive.\n\n**Isnt Tree Micellar Melting Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Sap , Opuntia Ficus-Indica Seed Oil , Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Squalane\n\n**My thought:** This is a liquidy cleansing oil that comes in a pump bottle. It’s thin in texture and gentle, but effective. It’s also non irritating to the eyes, and rinses off well. Compare to the hada labo, it’s a thinner oil, and I have to use more product than Hada Labo to cleanse my entire face. I need 3 pumps for Isnt Tree as opposed to only 2 pumps for Hada Labo. If you are deciding between the 2, I would recommend Hada Labo. It’s just as effective if not more, the bottle lasts longer, and more cost effective as well.\n\n**Purito from Green Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Vegetable Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**My thought:** This oil cleanser come in a pump bottle similar to the ones from Hada Labo and Isnt Tree, but the texture is thicker than the other 2 brands. It’s effective, but gentle and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I need about 3 pumps to cleanse my entire face. Overall, it’s a good cleanser but I still prefer the Hada Labo because it’s cheaper, works just as well, and the bottle lasts longer.\n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient solvent), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate (emollient cleansing agent), Diisooctyl Succinate (emollient), Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters (emollient cleansing agent/emulsifier), Trihydroxystearin (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (emulsifier), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant).\n\n**My thought:** This one has a balm like texture coming out of the tube and spread easily on the skin. There’s no residue left behind after cleansing. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn’t sting my eyes and is also effective. It has no discernible smell, which is nice since some fragrance-free products can still have an unpleasant smell due to the raw ingredients used in the formula.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-10 Isostearate, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Seed Water, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Water, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**My thought:** This is the most recent product that I've tried and is my current favorite. If I have to choose only 1 balm/oil cleanser to use, this would be the one. It replaces my previous favorite cleansing balm from Paula's Choice. The texture is smooth and gentle on the skin. It spreads more easily than Paula's Choice's and has no detectable scent. \n\n**Other plain oil options I’ve tried that work well:** When I run out of my balm cleanser and haven’t purchased a replacement in time. I usually use plain oils to remove my makeup. But because plain oils do not contain emulsifier, they don’t come off with water, so I have to immediately follow up with a water based cleanser to rinse off the oil residue on my face. Here are 2 oils that I like to use:\n\n**Coconut oil**: thicker oil, best for people with normal to dry skin\n\n**Jojoba Oil:** thinner in texture than coconut oil, best for oily and combo skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Top 3:** \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser**\n\nIf you have a favorite oil/balm cleansers that are not on this list, please share with me in the comment :)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "This is so cool! I love seeing people as committed to zero fragrance/irritants as I am! I'm definitely going to keep these in mind for reccing balms in the future since I don't usually mess with those.\n\nFor context, I'm dry skin and sensitive + acne prone, plus have keratosis pilaris. A cleansing oil I would highly suggest to try out is\n\nKOSE SPEEDY cleansing oil. Here is the current ingredient list https://incidecoder.com/products/kose-speedy-cleansing-oil\n\n you'll see a lot of different listings since they reformulated a lot but this is the right one. \nIt is a very light, well emulsified oil that rinses cleanly and doesn't overstrip. Spreads very well. Doesn't leave a residue. It is even good as a solo cleanse! This is my default recc for any skin type or with any condition. I have people with rosacea, eczema, and ichthyosis using it so I'm very confident in its gentleness. In the US, there's 1pack 7.8oz for $13 or 2pack with 1 full and 1 refill for $20 on Amazon. Some have mentioned being able to find it at Daiso stores in US and other countries. \n\nSo this second one I've only used for a week but I begrudgingly have been pretty into it as I'm more on the dry side. It's the Neutrogena lightweight body oil fragrance-free https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/body-oil-fragrance-free/6861830.html\n\nIt's a very low-viscosity watery-freling oil and it has good spreadability. Works really well at getting into pore for that deep but gentle clean you want from oils. It's probably the gentlest one I've tried even more so than my DIY sunflower/grapeseed + Polysorbate 80 I've made. The \"problem\" is that the Neutrogena oil does not rinse well at all. However I think it might good alternative for people who have tried other oil cleanser and found the emulsifiers just made it too much for their skin but don't want to use a pure oil. It does mostly come off with the gentle second cleanse. It will leave a bit behind in your skin, but as someone dry I quite appreciate that slight buffer for the cleanser and it hasn't caused any issues or broken me out. My skin does actually feel quite a bit more comfortable and less dry since introducing this when this was the only change. It does feel decently nourishing without being overwhelming. It definitrly lives up to its claims if used this way. Normal price is $13 for 8.5oz but can be found for $9-10 on sale sometimes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but my skin has already decided it likes this, so... 😒\n\nAs my gentle water-based cleanser, my current favorite is the Pipette baby wash and shampoo fragrance-free https://www.target.com/p/pipette-baby-shampoo-wash-fragrance-free-11-8-fl-oz/-/A-79503241. I get a lot of funny looks when I recc this but it's genuinely the best thing I've found that is on par in gentleness with some of the better non-foaming cleansers like the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser and is more affordable. It has amazing spreadability and you don't need a lot. I have gone through 4 bottles and am about to repurchase because I'm too hooked and it's insanely cost effective compared to most facial cleansers. Normal price is $8 for 12oz, it's commonly on sale for $6.50ish and one time I caught it for $4 so I stocked up hard. But I'd be happy paying $8. I also use it for body and hair so 😳 I felt it was worth mentioning since it's the second cleanse I follow with.\n\nI'm definitely gonna be taking a look at more of your content now as well!

    "body": "**Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream**\n\nYay…I’m so happy to be back to writing reviews! The past couple of weeks have left me less than motivated to talk/write about skincare. But, I feel like finding a balance between keeping up with my interests/hobbies while also setting aside time to support the community will be best for me. Plus…looking at my spreadsheet and seeing so many products approaching the one month mark makes me anxious LOL! \n\nThe Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream is a product that so many people have suggested to me and raved about. This is a medium weight/thick cream style product that has a very slight “jelly” feel compared to other heavier night creams. Featured ingredients include Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (wow…writing that for the first time in weeks is nice), Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Lotus Flower Extract, and several Ceramides/Peptides. Blue Chamomile Extract is also featured here to really support calming/redness reduction. That ingredient is also what gives this product its light blue hue.\n\nApplication of this product is pretty straight forward…just slap it on LOL! The Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream applies/glides on fairly easily and absorbs well. In fact…for me it tended to absorb a little too well for my taste leading me to use a bit more per application than I had anticipated. The lack of added fragrance (including essential oils) here means that this product has a light “lotion” scent but really there isn’t much of a scent at all. \n\nOnce applied and absorbed…the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream really impressed me with the light yet slightly dewy finish it left my skin. Even with the various oils and Shea Butter this product doesn’t feel greasy or leave a shiny residue. I kind of love the way my skin looks after using this product to the point that I could see myself using it in the AM if my skin was feeling particularly dry. This product really leaves my skin feeling nourished and hydrated.  \n\nAs for the calming/soothing benefit, that is where this product takes a bit of a stumble in my opinion (I know…GASP). While I do think the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream provides a physical cooling effect upon application and some mild redness reduction…it wasn’t as impactful on my skin as it has been for so many others. It was a great support product (especially as I was adjusting to Tretinoin)…but I found myself relying much more on the I’m From Mugwort Essence and Mask as real soothing/redness reducing steps. \n\nThe Ceramides here along with the nourishing emollients are an excellent way to moisturize the skin and lock in hydration. There is no doubt that this product helped to keep my skin as happy and healthy as it could be while adjusting to Tretinoin and I’m so glad I decided two work it into my routine. But, those that are looking specifically for a calming/soothing product and aren’t as concerned with the other benefits may be left wanting more. Also, those that tend to go heavy with their night cream application (be it to quench dry skin or just as a personal preference) may burn through this product faster than anticipated. I was lucky enough to have both the 30ml and 60ml versions and I ended up having to crack open the 60ml before the month trial was up just to finish out the month.   \n \n\nWhen it comes to a recommendation…I don’t know if I can call this one a winner for me or point people to it. If calming/soothing are what you are after I would go for the I’m From Mugwort Essence and keep your moisturizer focused on hydration/nourishment. If Ceramides/Peptides are your jam this could be a good option…but keep an eye out for products that don’t have the Blue Chamomile (as they might be a bit more affordable). I have the Klairs Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion in my stash now and while it does not contain Peptides it does have Ceramides, Jojoba Oil, and Shea Butter. From what I remember it is about the same price as the 60ml Midnight Blue Calming Cream…but it comes in at 250ml. \n\nI’ll keep hunting for a moisturizer that perfectly marries soothing/calming with. nourishment…I just didn’t find the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream to be it. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Candelilla Cera, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/Soybean/Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nWhere To Buy ($24.50 USD on Wishtrend for 30ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/midnight-blue-calming-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/midnight-blue-calming-cream/)",

    "body": "Hey all! I'm back with review #2 in my series of lesser-discussed product reviews. I hope the one for the [Benton TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/) was useful, as I'm new to writing reviews. If you were/weren't a fan, feel free to leave a comment letting me know what you thought! On to today's review!\n\n**Tosowoong Natural Pure Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil**\n\nI need to confess right off the bat that Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil is my forever and always HG first cleanser, and I will never find a product I like more. That being said, at $30 for a 6oz (170ml) bottle on Amazon, it's not a product my bank account will allow me to put on my face every day. And that's where Tosowoong comes in...it's a good, basic cleansing oil that helps me stretch my precious Sulwhasoo a bit further. I know the Propolis Sparkle Ampoule is the Tosowoong product that gets all the buzz around here, but the cleanser is seriously under-hyped, in my humble opinion. \n\n**Packaging:** The cleanser comes in a 120ml clear plastic bottle with an orangey label and a brown pump top. It's certainly simple, but the little apricot drawing on the front is cute, and more importantly, the packaging is practical. The clear bottle means that you can see when you're running out, and the pump top came with a detachable/re-attachable plastic piece that keeps the pump from being pushed down when the product's not in use. It held up great in my checked back through two flights recently, so that's a plus. The one downside is that the plastic top does feel a bit flimsy...it hasn't broken on me yet, but I'm always a bit worried that it might when I'm traveling. \n\n**Ingredients:** This was a bit tricky, as the ingredients aren't listed in English on the packaging. But thanks to [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3c7vij/has_anyone_tried_the_tosowoong_apricot_seed/) post from u/riceprincesspt back in 2015, I was able to find the full ingredients list. As far as I know, it has not been reformulated since then, and the ingredients list remains the same. Oil cleansers are always a bit tricky, as oils seem to be a bit polarizing in terms of which ones break different people out. Unsurprisingly, apricot seed oil is the first ingredient listed, present in a concentration of 40%. While I haven't heard of many people irritated by apricot seed oil, some of the other ingredients may keep some folks away. CosDNA lists Isopropyl Myristate (a derivative of coconut oil) as a 5 on their acne trigger scale, while olive oil and jojoba oil both score a 2. \nThe product also contains mineral oil and fragrance, which some people are sensitive to. \n\nHere is the full ingredients list:\n\nApricot Seed oil (40%), Mineral Oil, PEG-20, Glyceryl Triiso, Stearate, Jojoba Seed Oil (5%), Isopropyl Myristate, PEG-8 Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Macadamia Seed Oil, Olive Oil, Argan Spinosa Kernel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Papaya Fruit Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Leaf/Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Apple Extract, Fragrance\n\n**Price:** I got mine for $14 on Jolse, which works out to about 12 cents per ml\n\n**Use and Performance:** I've used the Tosowoong Natural Pure Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil for  more than two months now. Like any other oil cleanser, this one should be applied to a dry face. Simply apply the oil cleanser, rub it in for a bit of an oil massage if you'd like, then apply water to emulsify and rinse. It has a relatively strong smell compared to other cleansers I've tried. I know logically that it smells like apricot pits, but to me, it smells like pumpkin. Not in a pumpkin spice way, but in a carving pumpkins for Halloween while its seeds are roasting in the oven way. \n\nI've found that 3 pumps is the magic number for me with this cleanser. It's a fairly thin consistency, which is both good and bad...it gives it plenty of slip for a nice oil massage, but also means that I tend to lose more product than I'd like. I've consistently been able to get grits while massaging with this product. And this cleanser emulsifies like a dream. All it takes is a bit of water and hardly any effort to turn it into a white foamy consistency that washes off cleanly. I'm seriously impressed by its emulsifying power and the fact that it doesn't leave any residue or dryness. I still like to follow up with a water-based cleanser, but not because of anything this cleansing oil leaves behind.\n\n Using an oil cleanser in general has been really great for my acne. That being said, I don't think that the Tosowoong apricot seed cleanser is as effective as my Sulwhasoo cleanser in unclogging my pores and thus preventing acne. It's a *very* subtle difference, but if I use this one too often, it starts to add up, and my breakouts get a little worse. I don't think it's a case of the cleanser itself breaking me out, because as I said, it washes off cleanly, and as far as I know none of its ingredients break me out. However, I just don't think it cleanses as deeply and effectively as my other oil cleanser by just a very slight margin. As I don't use it every day, it's not a big detractor for me, but I may consider trying something different in the future. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** This cleansing oil gets major points for its emulsifying and rinsing off abilities. There's no film, and no weird sensation left over. I think that this cleanser would work really well as an introduction to oil cleansing due to the ease of use and the fact that it's pretty effective without being expensive. However, the oils it uses can be acne triggers for many, which kind of limits the number of people who can use it. Also, if you're acne prone and find that oil cleansing helps with your acne, this might not have enough oomph for you. However, if your skin isn't particularly sensitive and you're looking for a no-frills cleansing oil with a modest price tag, this might be a good option for you.\n\n**My Rating: 4/5**\n\nAs always, feel free to leave feedback or questions!

    "body": "Waitrose have a skin/hair care line called 'Pure' which is fragrance free, hypoallergenic, cruelty free and uses mostly 'naturally derived' ingredients, whatever that means. It's also really cheap, and regularly on offer. I know this isn't a hair care sub, but their shampoo and conditioners are fab, and extremely good value. The dry/damaged conditioner is how I make it up to my hair for bleaching it to all hell. \n\nAnyway, I got a few of the skincare products a few months ago when they were doing 3 for 2. They're now on 1/3 off, so I thought I'd post some mini-reviews. \n\nI would describe my skin as oily, somewhat congested, and quick to anger. It’s also probably somewhat dehydrated by bad office aircon and just, like, winter in general. \n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Hot Cloth Cleanser** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-hot-cloth/508007-539993-539994\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Candelilla Cera, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa Powder, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Aqua, Tocopherol,  Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Phytate\n\n**Verdict:** God, I wanted to like this. I love hot cloth cleansers, and this one was so simple and cheap - and it even comes with a cloth! However, the rice powder totally ruins it for me - using a face cloth is exfoliating enough, and I don’t want even a gentle scrub on my face. If you are super into scrubbing your face, this might be perfect - it’s not going to rip you to shreds like walnut shells, and it’s not illegal  and murderous like microbeads. \n\nI was very sad about this until I realised that what I did now have was a super-luxurious body scrub. I used it the other day - I spent a long time massaging it into dry skin before taking a hot shower and washing it all off with a sponge. Because the cleanser’s so rich, my skin was very soft and moisturised afterwards, and a couple of days later the patches of KP I had were almost gone. I might do it again next weekend - it’s not really a weekday type thing because rubbing it all in takes ages, washing it all off also takes ages, and they’re both kind of the point (it’s sort of like a soothing diy massage) so you don’t want to hurry it.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Facial Oil** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-facial-oil/862289-541045-541046\n\n**Ingredients:** Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil,  Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Prunus Persica Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid\n\n**Verdict:** Blergh. I sometimes do really well with facial oils - I really love the Boots Botanics Organic one - but this was just a nope all round. Bar the absence of smell, it just feels like I rubbed coconut oil into my skin. I shine with a thin film of grease. I might try it on my hair, maybe? Or try doing the OCM with it? I will say this, the packaging’s nice - a lovely frosted glass bottle - so I suppose if nothing else I can empty it out and put other things into it. As you can see, I’m trying really hard to find positives here.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Day Cream SPF 15** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-day-cream-spf-15/450717-539849-539850\n(It says ‘this product is unavailable’ but it’s definitely for sale in multiple shops.)\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Zinc Oxide (Nano), Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Simmondsia Chinesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Phenoxyethanol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Aluminum Stearate, Sodium Phytate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isostearic Acid, Alumina, Methylpropanediol, Tocopherol, Sodium Hydroxide, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Disostearate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate\n\n**Verdict:** Hell to the yeah. I really really love this moisturiser, and have just rebought it as I’m getting near the bottom of the jar and it’s on offer again. I think it’s just that my skin is a big fan of zinc oxide, since I find that Sudocrem also calms my skin down a whole bunch. It’s thick and creamy, and feels very protective against the winter wind, and it’s the only thing that seems capable of withstanding a day in the weird dry recirculated air in my office. It’s not every day you find a physical-only sunscreen for such a low price, either, even if it is only SPF15. There’s a slight whiteness as you rub it in, and people with darker skin tones might find it leaves a cast - I’m not sure, as I haven’t noticed one, but my underlying skin colour’s quite pale and so it’s not always visible on me. On days when I especially don’t care about ruining the SPF aspect (ie most days right now because it’s deepest winter and I’m barely leaving the house anyway) I will often mix in a bit of Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nThe Pure Natural line is even cheaper. In particular, I think it’s great that they offer some really basic thick face creams with no fragrance. I’m probably going to try out their SLS free face wash at some point.",

    "body": "My hair type is 3c maaaaaybe 4a. I am currently living in Japan and have very little access to curly hair care without having to ship stuff (which is quite expensive and not always possible). I cant even find coconut oil. I have found a Japanese conditioner which is all organic and doesn't seem to have anything bad in it but my hair is not responding AT ALL. I ordered some marshmallow root to help with slip but my hair is very dry and hard and frizzy and tangled and unhappy. So I am unhappy.\n\nI wash my hair twice a week. I put some conditioner in it and massage my scalp and cold rinse. I then use conditioner to detangle. After detangling I put a mixture of olive oil and honey on my hair with some Marc Anthony Curl cream (which I have to import and has evil ingredients too)\n\nIt takes over an hour to detangle (with my fingers). I want to know what I am doing so wrong so that I can keep on looking for a conditioner that works or some extra ingredients to import to mix with my current conditioner. I used to use Tressame Moisture Rich (which is also not available in Japan) but I noticed it had dimethicone in it so I stopped but my curls felt and looked soo much happier back then. I am so frustrated. \n\nThe conditioner I am using now has many emolients in the ingredients and not so many moisturizing components but I dont know what to add.\n\nTop 15 ingredients are: water, Behenyl\tSynthetic (rapeseed, etc.), \nBehenyl PG trimonium chloride, Alga near spinosa kernel oil, Macadamia nut oil, Damask rose flower oil, Atlas Cedar bark oil, Lavender oil, Jojoba seed oil, Olive oil, Broccoli seed oil, Almond oil, Rose hip oil, Sunflower seed oil \n\nThe website with detailed ingredients is below, google translate works very well (I am sorry):\nhttp://www.matsukiyo.co.jp/mkc/argelan/products/argan_treatment.html\n\nI washed my hair this morning. Let it air dry and the result is here --> http://imgur.com/8RjAeB7\nhttp://imgur.com/vaNdT4p",

        "body": "Hello fellow expat! *waves from Hiroshima*\n\nI, too, have been using the same brand now for a few months on my 2b-c/3a mix, and have had good results. Are you using the ancient clay or the macadamia conditioner? I use the ancient clay stuff 1-2 times a week with the pink clay mask once a week after shampooing with the seaweed mineral gel. S2C comes out feeling a bit sticky on second day and third day curls, but I think I just haven't found the right amount of conditioner for it yet. I did condition a bit more often when I started using it, probably closer to every other day.\n\nSo far, this is the best stuff I've found for curly hair in the country in the 10 years I've been here. I used to use the Je L'Aime Amino line in the pink bottles, but the conditioner and deep conditioner still had silicones and made the back of my head crispy. The other brand I liked that I haven't seen in Hiroshima is RinRen: http://www.bxe.co.jp/rinren/en/ Silicone free and I do believe SLS free even though they don't advertise it. I used to find it at Sugi Pharmacy when I lived in Gifu, so if you have any of those around you try looking for it there.\n\nI don't personally use coconut oil, but I have seen it more often in higher-end grocery stores lately. I have no idea if that's even usable on hair, to be honest. Most AEON and YouMe Town shopping malls should have a Kaldi shop in them, which usually sells coconut oil among its import baking items.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, iherb.com is a great site for hair care items. I order my Kinky Curly Styling Custard through them, along with multivitamins and melatonin to qualify for free shipping. If you haven't tried iHerb yet and are interested, lemme know. I should have a referral code that should give you a bit of a discount.",

They probably have those around there.  I live in a desert cold area and my hair is dry but doing deep conditioning treatments help a lot.  Opening the hair cuticle helps moisture get in, then risen with cold. If you have low porosity hair you might want to stay away from coconut oil because it will make it dryer.  If your products right now have keratin you might be overloading protein in your hair.",

Most of the time people comment \"wow, you didnt look like you had THAT much hair\" when cutting it.\nMy sister has much coarser hair so she looks like she has double the ammt i do. Her curls have always been superior because of this IMHO.\n\nShe lived in japan for over a year and while shes never embraced her curls like i do, she started spending a LOT of time straighening and blow drying and using curling irons etc.\n\nI think i know why now!\n\nYou may just want to explore options getting stuff shipped in. My sister is 6' and like a size 0, and wears a 11-12 shoe and despite being model thin couldnt find clothes (even XL and mens stuff was too short) and shoes (mens shoes didnt fit) and ended up ordering things to my moms house via amazon/zappos, then having my mom ship cheap to japan. It was cheaper than shipping from those sites to japan direct.\n\nI think if i was moving there priority #1 would be bras (28GG) and #2 would be conditioners. Lol.\n\nHopefully you can find something!",

    "body": "**Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream**\n\nYay…I’m so happy to be back to writing reviews! The past couple of weeks have left me less than motivated to talk/write about skincare. But, I feel like finding a balance between keeping up with my interests/hobbies while also setting aside time to support the community will be best for me. Plus…looking at my spreadsheet and seeing so many products approaching the one month mark makes me anxious LOL! \n\nThe Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream is a product that so many people have suggested to me and raved about. This is a medium weight/thick cream style product that has a very slight “jelly” feel compared to other heavier night creams. Featured ingredients include Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (wow…writing that for the first time in weeks is nice), Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Lotus Flower Extract, and several Ceramides/Peptides. Blue Chamomile Extract is also featured here to really support calming/redness reduction. That ingredient is also what gives this product its light blue hue.\n\nApplication of this product is pretty straight forward…just slap it on LOL! The Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream applies/glides on fairly easily and absorbs well. In fact…for me it tended to absorb a little too well for my taste leading me to use a bit more per application than I had anticipated. The lack of added fragrance (including essential oils) here means that this product has a light “lotion” scent but really there isn’t much of a scent at all. \n\nOnce applied and absorbed…the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream really impressed me with the light yet slightly dewy finish it left my skin. Even with the various oils and Shea Butter this product doesn’t feel greasy or leave a shiny residue. I kind of love the way my skin looks after using this product to the point that I could see myself using it in the AM if my skin was feeling particularly dry. This product really leaves my skin feeling nourished and hydrated.  \n\nAs for the calming/soothing benefit, that is where this product takes a bit of a stumble in my opinion (I know…GASP). While I do think the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream provides a physical cooling effect upon application and some mild redness reduction…it wasn’t as impactful on my skin as it has been for so many others. It was a great support product (especially as I was adjusting to Tretinoin)…but I found myself relying much more on the I’m From Mugwort Essence and Mask as real soothing/redness reducing steps. \n\nThe Ceramides here along with the nourishing emollients are an excellent way to moisturize the skin and lock in hydration. There is no doubt that this product helped to keep my skin as happy and healthy as it could be while adjusting to Tretinoin and I’m so glad I decided two work it into my routine. But, those that are looking specifically for a calming/soothing product and aren’t as concerned with the other benefits may be left wanting more. Also, those that tend to go heavy with their night cream application (be it to quench dry skin or just as a personal preference) may burn through this product faster than anticipated. I was lucky enough to have both the 30ml and 60ml versions and I ended up having to crack open the 60ml before the month trial was up just to finish out the month.   \n \n\nWhen it comes to a recommendation…I don’t know if I can call this one a winner for me or point people to it. If calming/soothing are what you are after I would go for the I’m From Mugwort Essence and keep your moisturizer focused on hydration/nourishment. If Ceramides/Peptides are your jam this could be a good option…but keep an eye out for products that don’t have the Blue Chamomile (as they might be a bit more affordable). I have the Klairs Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion in my stash now and while it does not contain Peptides it does have Ceramides, Jojoba Oil, and Shea Butter. From what I remember it is about the same price as the 60ml Midnight Blue Calming Cream…but it comes in at 250ml. \n\nI’ll keep hunting for a moisturizer that perfectly marries soothing/calming with. nourishment…I just didn’t find the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream to be it. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Candelilla Cera, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/Soybean/Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nWhere To Buy ($24.50 USD on Wishtrend for 30ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/midnight-blue-calming-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/midnight-blue-calming-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x41tcre6fj551.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2599382a8724f11086672c1e653a6646d411958\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tltx5h7fj551.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26afec2242403028be33ac2c5904a6d7fa1e4813",

    "body": "I got my hands onto the Pyunkang Yul skincare line recently from StyleKorea and after using the Moisture Cream for 3 weeks now, I wanted to give a mini review. \n\n[Photos](http://imgur.com/a/vInCX)\n\n**As quoted from OhLolly:**\n> Pyunkang Yul Moisture cream is a powerfully effective daily moisturizer for all skin types, especially those with sensitive, acne-prone or oily skin. Formulated with safe and gentle ingredients free of fragrance and artificial dyes, the creamy texture goes on smoothly, absorbs easily, providing a soft and supple finish without feeling greasy or sticky. Perfect for sealing in moisture and keeping skin looking radiant and youthful all day long.\n\n**My skin type is dehydrated + combo skin.**\nI certainly can agree that it is a great moisturizer for everyday use. I don't have super sensitive skin on my face so I can't really say if it's a good product for those with sensitive or acne prone skin. The ingredients listed in [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8da2277873.html) especially with **Butylene Glycol (1), Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil (2) and Cetearyl Alcohol (2)** being acne triggers and irritants might be something to consider. I haven't experienced any reactions.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* No fragrance.\n* Absorbs quickly, leaves a subtle glowy finish but not sticky. In a few minutes, your skin will feel like normal but will be much softer.\n* Lightweight, good for oilier skin - consistency exactly the same as CosRX Honey Ceramide Eye Cream.\n* A small scoop goes a long way for the whole face. I barely made much of a dent in it. \n* A bit less oily in the T zone during the day.\n* Comes with a spatula, jar made out of glass and its heavy but good quality packaging.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Doesn't seem to last very long, I wore it at night as well and the next morning, I looked a bit dry.\n* Did not help with my dry patches. It'll moisturize the area, but after a few hours my dry patches were noticeable.\n* Has a few acne/irritant ingredients in it, where two of them were 2nd or 3rd on the list.\n* A bit overpriced (~$32 USD) for 100mL.\n\nMy overall feeling is that this cream felt _meh_. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't terrible. It was like a generic hand/body/face cream.\nI will not be repurchasing this, but I'll use it up. _It'll take such a long time....nggggg._",

And everytime I put the pippet back to the bottle the serum left on the  side of the pippet mess with the lid of the bottle. Terrible! It should come in a pump packaging!

    "body": "**Video Link**\n\n[Supply Ultra Lather \"Crisp\" shaving cream](https://youtu.be/ERCpL5qQPIo)\n\n**Disclosure Statements**\n\n* Supply provided both the razor and soap for review\n* I bought the brush and knot with my own money\n* I bought the aftershave with my own money\n* A YouTube viewer sent me the Myrsol liquid shave soap\n\n**Review**\n\nI have used the Supply razor a number of times before, but never their shaving cream. I had pinged Supply to congratulate them on their Shark Tank experience, and they offered to send me the **Supply Ultra Lather \"Crisp\" shaving cream** for review.\n\nThe cream comes in a tall and relatively narrow jar, so no matter how you elect to use it, you are going to be scooping some out; you cannot really load your brush in the jar. The instructions on the jar say to scoop out an almond sized amount and rub all over your face, which is certainly one way to go. I scooped out enough for the week into the Captain's Choice loading bowl and that worked just as well. I have brought the jar format to Supply's attention and perhaps they will change the jar format to make loading the brush easier.\n\nThe shave cream is a non-tallow formula and includes shea butter, jojoba seed oil, cocoa seed butter, and mango seed butter. Overall performance is pretty good, with a nice slick lather. The cream is quite easy to work with, but it can be sensitive to water (thins out without additional slickness if you add too much water or add it too quickly) and it generally feels a bit thin or light compared to many other artisan soaps on the market. Nothing spectacular here, but a significant step up for people who are switching from cartridge shaving to a new Supply razor.\n\nThe scent is light, but the name is a good choice. The scent has a crisp, slightly citrus and floral scent (from the bergamot and jasmine); I don't get much juniper from the scent.\n\n**The Supply SE razor** is just as good as I remember, and I am kicking myself for not picking up better SE blades. The ones I have are fine, but not great. The head design and blade rigidity make for a cartridge-like shave, with very little sense of the blade on your skin and certainly no blade edge chatter at all. Very comfortable to use with the #2 base plate, including buffing in the last pass, and efficient, but favoring comfort over efficiency. I wish Supply all the best with their new company direction and funding, I hope it means lots more people moving over to a better way of shaving!\n\n**The Dogwood Handcrafts custom brush with Declaration Grooming B7 badger knot** is still a complete delight to use. I love the handle, the shape just feels right when I hold it, and the knot has a great balance of density, backbone, and softness. I am not sure I would really need the face of the knot to be any bigger, given the degree of splay.\n\n**The Myrsol liquid shave soap with lanolin** is supposed to be used with a brush, but the last time I tried that, it did not really ever form a true lather. The liquid soap works well as a pre-shave, just apply a bit to your wet face and lather right over it. I used it as a post-shave this time, just sort of \"washing\" my face with it and then rinsing my face again. This does leave your skin feeling smooth and a bit moisturized, and may minimize the impact of the aftershave splash.\n\n**Aftershave**? I have used a different one each day, because there is really no reason to use just one. I am going to rotate through them more in 2020, rather than stick with just one for the week, unless I am doing a matching soap and aftershave set. I have too many just sitting on the shelf getting no use, and it has been so fun to pick a new one every day. Today's aftershave is the **Mickey Lee Soapworks \"Colonia di Agrumi\"**. I love the scent, I love the big alcohol hit of the splash, and I love the fact that I have an entire untouched bottle in reserve.\n\n**One more video this year**, which will be my 2019 wetshaving review, including my picks for the best of 2019 based entirely on the super-secret and never-to-be-revealed Cadinscore.\n\n**[Check out my Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5IYGAzMgL3fxMxvcLxIVF2?si=nvo5IIZkQhGBvcOIGABzbQ)** for some of the great music I enjoyed this year!

    "body": "**NOTE:** I'm talking about the one with the [green and yellow packaging](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/rohto-mentholatum-hada-labo-gokujyun-oil-cleansing-200ml/info.html/pid.1068397806), NOT the one with the white label on the front.\n\n**WHY I BOUGHT IT**\n\nThis is my first time trying an oil cleanser - I was reluctant to try one for a while because I don't wear makeup, so I thought it would just be a waste. However, I was really interested in the potential to unclog pores, which is what really attracted me to this. This oil cleanser is a cult favourite and it seems to be loved by so many people, as well as being fragrance-free and affordable.\n\n**MY SKIN TYPE/CONCERNS**\n\nI have pretty dry skin most of the time, which was dehydrated but since finding Curel Intensive Moisture Cream acts pretty normal most of the time, although I do have to be speedy about putting skincare on once I cleanse my face. I'm prone to clogged pores on my chin and nose as well as inflammatory acne on my chin, but this has all been massively improved by Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid. Fragrance and essential oils cause acne for me.\n\n**HOW/WHERE I BOUGHT IT**\n\nPurchased on [Stylevana](https://www.stylevana.com/en_GB/rohto-mentholatum-hada-labo-gokujyun-oil-cleansing-japan-version-200ml.html), you can see my full haul [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ipx6hn/haul_stylevana_haul/) for \\~£12 for 200ml.\n\n**HOW LONG I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR**\n\nI've been using this oil cleanser for 3 weeks exactly, once a day in the evening as a first cleanse.\n\n**INGREDIENTS LIST**\n\n*Ethylhexyl palmitate, triethylhexanoin, sorbes tetraisostearate-30, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate,* ***olive fruit oil, water, sodium acetyl hyaluronate, hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, jojoba seed oil***\\*, (palmitic acid / ethyl hexanoic acid), dextrin, butyl carbamate propionyl iodide, BHT\\*\n\nAs you can see, it's a pretty basic ingredients list. Fragrance, essential oil and alcohol free, which is great if you're sensitive to any of those. The main oil here is olive fruit oil - not really much to say, it's quite nice and basic. There's also jojoba seed oil and two types of hyaluronic acid for some extra hydration, although this is a cleanser so there most likely won't be many hydrating benefits.\n\n**SCENT**\n\nNone at all, as you would expect. Does not smell like focaccia or pasta, unlike some other olive-oil based cleansers (according to what people say).\n\n**TEXTURE + EMULSIFICATION**\n\nThis has a very light, fluid texture. The colour is a pale yellow, as you would expect. It spreads really easily over your face and I only need one pump, meaning that it will most likely last me ages. This cleanser emulsifies super super quickly, so whenever I wash my hands before cleansing I have to make sure they are fully dry, as any moisture on them starts to emulsify the cleanser. As it emulsifies so well, it rinses off super quickly.\n\n**EFFECTS + CLEANSING POWER**\n\nI don't wear makeup, nor do I have a Sunscreenr :( so I can't prove how well it removes thick sunscreen or heavy makeup. I have tried it with 3 layers of P20 Kids SPF50+ which it removed really well though. After cleansing my skin feels really soft, plump and hydrated, so I think it's pretty gentle. Due to the fluidity, you also don't have to tug or rub to remove it, which is great.\n\nI don't think it's massively improved my clogged pores but it's pretty hard to tell. I haven't broken out at all this month which is pretty amazing, so maybe it has done it's job. Equally, it could be that the BHA has finally fully cleared up my skin after 2-3 months.\n\n**PACKAGING**\n\nThe packaging isn't cute or fun, but it is really functional. The pump is great - it dispenses the perfect amount of cleanser and it's very easy to use in the shower. The bottle is plastic so it's very shower-friendly and they also sell refills so you can save money and re-use your pump bottle.\n\n**OVERALL THOUGHTS**\n\nI love how it makes my skin feel so soft after cleansing, and it really does cut through layers of sunscreen. Coupled with the easy application, great price and quick emulsification it's a winner in my eyes! It may not be the most exciting cleanser, nor does it have the most fun, cute packaging, but it does what it was supposed to really well - I couldn't ask for more at the price point.\n\n**9/10 - I recommend this product if you want an affordable, fragrance-free and very effective oil cleanser that emulsifies quickly. Definitely WRP, although I might branch out and try a cleansing balm. Does anyone have any fragrance-free suggestions?**",

I started avoiding sun, and wearing the spf lip balm whenever exposed to sun and for the night I’d put on the vit A ointment which would first help a bit, but not much anymore. I stopped using the lip peeling as it was only making things worse. i drink a lot of water, have a balanced diet, take vit D daily.

    "body": "hi everybody--after fun with cleansing oils/balms and milks, i've jumped into the pool of cleansing creams. which also, i'm now realizing, might be able to double as wash-off masks, since they literally wash off.\n\nfor myself, since i'm very dry, a cleanser that removes complexion makeup *and* adds a moisturizing, emollient layer to skin (instead of stripping it) is the holy grail. to that end i've tried a few: \n\n**the natural superstar: skylake massage and cleansing cream**\n/u/TheCuriousAmerican turned me onto the magical skylake massage and cleansing cream. this is pricey but absolutely lovely, especially if you're into natural/plant-derived ingredients, and has kind of a barleyish, very grown-up scent. here's a rough google translate of the ingredients TheCuriousAmerican provided us:\n\n*extract of Oriental herbaceous plants (Chrysanthemum morifolium extract, Peppermint leaf extract, Mulberry leaf extract, Cucurbitaceae extract, Licorice extract, Morus alba extract, Extract), cyclopentasiloxane, caprylic / capric triglyceride, Glyceryl polymethacrylate / propylene glycol, doene oil [not sure what that one is...], safflower oil, cetyl hexyl hexanoate, grape seed oil, glycine oil, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, butylenelic acid, isopropyl myristate, Olive oil, olive oil, extracts of corn oil, extracts of corn oil, extracts of corn oil, almond oil, allantoin, marjoram, olive oil, polyacrylamide / C13-14 isoparaffin / laureth 7, glycerin, jojoba seed oil, bergamot oil, evening primrose oil, collagen, Extracts, Centella asiatica extracts, Methylglucose-20, Betaine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Marflur HydroSammic acid / Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panenol, Human Oligopeptide-1*\n\nthis feels so luxurious and wonderful that the *only* reason i didn't shell out $27 for it is that i happen to be sensitive to plant oils.\n\n**the crowd pleaser: face shop herb day cleansing cream**\nthe face shop has a series of very cheap, fun-scented cleansing creams (aloe, green tea, fruit, \"cereal\"). i have the cereal flavor (a little barley-ish, a little floral); ingredients [here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7440166393.html) (nb: fatty alcohols and plant extracts). this is lovely, soft, and cheap, but it doesn't leave behind as much emollience as i personally would like. people who enjoy fun scents and want something that rinses cleaner (oily skin folks?) would probably enjoy this quite a bit.\n\n**the extra-emollient multitasker: skinfood black sugar perfect cleansing cream**\nso far, this one is my favorite--it's similar to the skylake but without the plant oils. to me the scent is like lemon meringue pie (if you don't like lemon, you will not like this), and it leaves behind a glorious emollient, sleeping-pack-like layer on my skin--and the fact that it includes ceramide+cholesterol, amino acids, and glutamic acid means it serves as a pretty solid one-step evening routine, if i want. full ingredients [here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f20e179189.html)--possible irritants for those who are sensitive to them include triethanolamine, a little bit of sodium cetyl sulfate, and fatty alcohols. \n\n\ni'd love to hear anyone else's (perhaps little-discussed) cleansing cream experiences and recs!\n\nmyself, i'm currently awaiting a decant of the fiddy-reviewed [primera smooth cleansing cream](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/10/21/review-primera-smooth-cleansing-cream/) (nb: fatty alcohols and plant extracts).\n \nit does seem like folks with fatty alcohol sensitivities are not going to be able to use these--but maybe there's a fatty alcohol-free version somebody's found?",

Lots of Korean products since I checked out Shin-Okubo and the sales lady was... very persuading, haha.\n\nI did pick some stuff which I haven't seen here (correct me if I'm wrong) and I will slowly post reviews once I use them.\n\nMy haul:\nhttp://imgur.com/vUwSmtq\n\nI forgot to photograph other stuff I'd already bought and used like DHC lipbalm, Kiss me Heroine mascara, Kate eyeshadow, Canake eyeshadow primer, super cute headband from Tokyu Hands (purple and mint)...\n\nFirst of all, a cleansing balm. I normally use **Shu Uemura ultime8 sublime beauty cleansing oil** (+ either Hada Labo cleanser or a cheapo German one as 2nd cleanser) and I looove it. It even gets rid of the Kiss me Heroine mascara!\n\nI was browsing in a Ainz&Tulpe shop in Harajuku and saw this and thought it sounded interesting:\nhttp://imgur.com/vkwSH00\nhttp://imgur.com/gbuebKz\nhttp://imgur.com/kyXv536\n\n* Cationic surfacant free (I'd to google this)\n* Fragrance free\n* Colorant free\n* Paraben free\n* Alcohol free\n* Mineral oil free\n\nAnd it was pretty cheap 1620 yen for 100 g. It comes with a little plastic spoon (hidden under the lid).\n\nThis is how it looks undisturbed:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/l8bdfJ2\n\nOn the spoon:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/X62ZlJT\n\nOn skin (slightly massaged in):\n\nhttp://imgur.com/o7159Vs\n\nI put on the following:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/1KTo3LU\n\n* Liquid foundation (Chifure)\n* One-day tattoo super black eyeliner (only thing my oily eyelids will not destroy)\n* Guerlain red lipstick\n* Shu Uemura purple eyeshadow\n\nYou have to use it on dry skin, take a small amount of the balm  and massage it onto the skin. Then rinse with warm water.\n\nBefore rinsing:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/mv3ah\n\n(You can see it took off my foundation, lipstick and eyeshadow but the eyeliner remains)\n\nAfter rinsing:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Azg4jIJ\n\n(Yay, eyeliner is gone!)\n\nMy skin hasn't freaked out yet (it felt soooft). Their lotion apparently is pretty popular but since it is a new product I haven't found any reviews on it.\n\nhttp://alovivi.jp/shopdetail/000000000068/ct24/page1/order/\n\nMy skin: Dehydrated but oily (nose and forehead). 28 years old, live in Germany.\n\n**Ingredients (Google translated):**\nEthylhexyl palmitate, triethylhexanoin, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, isopropyl palmitate, PEG-5 glyceryl triisostearate, aloe vera leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, squalane, comedocasphospholipid, hydrogenated lecithin, lysolecithin, Lime fruit juice, orange juice, lemon juice, grapefruit fruit extract, hawthorn extract, jujube fruit extract, apple fruit extract, water soluble proteoglycan, water soluble collagen, yuzu fruit extract, pearl barley seed extract, Argania spinosa nuclear oil, olive fruit oil, Jojoba seed oil, tocopherol, water, BG, phenoxyethanol\n\nAnd: Isn't this Sailor Moon blush beautiful??\nhttp://imgur.com/ZnXvDYw",

I was drawn to Faded by Topicals for its powerhouse ingredients list and relatively low price (vs something like Skinceuticals Discoloration Defense), but I noticed that it says it should not be used with AHAs, BHAs, or retinols. However, it is recommended for daily use.\n\nMy issue is that my routine alternates nights between glycolic acid and 0.25% retinol. If this product can't be used in the same routine as either of those, I am stuck using it in the morning. But it has a STRONG scent, and I don't want to start my day smelling like sulfur, plus I prefer to do my active treatments at night -- mornings are very hectic around here and I need to keep my a.m. routine simple.\n\nLooking at the ingredient list (link to product and full ingredient list copied below), I don't know why it can't be used with AHAs, BHAs, or retinols, but I am not an expert so I thought I would see if anyone here does. Just wondering if it's not recommended because of the possibility of irritation, or if there are certain ingredients that inactivate each other or are harmful to combine.\n\nI've written to the company three times now asking these questions, and they haven't responded to any of my messages. Would be super grateful for any thoughts you all have!\n\nAnd if anyone out there with sun damage has a product they love, I would appreciate any recommendations.\n\nThank you!!!\n\nProduct link:\n\n[https://mytopicals.com/products/faded](https://mytopicals.com/products/faded)\n\nFull ingredient list:\n\nWater, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Niacinamide, Tranexamic Acid, Shea Butter, Glyceral Stearate, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Ceteareth-12, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract, Behenyl Alcohol, Alpha-Arbutin, Jojoba Seed Oil, Zinc Ricinoleate, Azelaic Acid, Glutathione, Kojic Acid Dipalmitate, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanyl Palmitate, Allantoin, Phytic Acid, Squalane, Palm Butter, Glycine, Soybean Sterols, Cetyl Palmitate, Lecithin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Licorice Root Extract, Melatonin, Turmeric Root Extract, Sclerotium Gum, Arginine, Cocos Nucifera Oil, Bisabolol, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n\\*FYI: Faded contains exfoliating acids and niacinamide, and **may** cause some initial skin purging.

Instead, I include another moisturizer and Hada Labo sunscreen.\n\nI'd been thinking about introducing a facial oil into my routine (don't really remember how that thought even popped into my head to begin with) which led to me buying some [Estelle & Thild Rose Otto Facial Oil](http://www.beautybay.com/skincare/estellethild/roseottofacialoil/). \n\nThe facial oil contains the following ingredients:\nSimmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil (Jojoba Oil)*, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil (Sweet Almond Oil)*, Persea Gratissima Oil (Avocado Oil)*, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil (Sunflower Seed Oil)*, Vaccinium Myrtillus Seed Oil (Blueberry Seed Oil), Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil (Sacha Inchi Oil)*, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil (Rose Otto)*, Citronellol, Limonene, Geraniol, Linalool, Tocopherol, Parfum. * Ingredient from Organic Farming.\n\n\n**For anyone who has/has had a facial oil somewhere in their asian skincare routine or even has experience with any of the ingredients listed:**\n\n1.

I've been using it for like, 4 years now, and I stopped the past month and my skin freaked out. \n\nAnyhoo, from what I know off the top of my head: jojoba oil is wonderful, non-comedogenic; sweet almond oil is super moisturizing, albeit slightly comedogenic (I have a 16 oz bottle of it coming! I use it all over my body in lieu of a body lotion); avocado & sunflower seed oil are pretty much on the same boat as sweet almond; I haven't really heard much about the rest, but my guess is blueberry seed oil has a bunch of anti-oxidants and the rose is probably added for its anti-inflammatory benefits.\n\n**So, onto your questions...**\n> Did you see a noticeable difference, either positive or negative? For example, like having any less than positive responses due to having so many products (which for some reason, became an odd concern of mine once I bought this oil haha).\n\nI'll be answering this about the inclusion of my rosehip seed oil in my routine. Oh and as a disclaimer I have a hybrid routine consisting of American, European and Asian skincare products. I definitely did see a noticeable difference--extremely positive when I used my oil at night regularly. As I mentioned, my skin freaked out when I decided (god knows why) to stop using the oil for a month. But otherwise, my skin has been clear for the last few years (save for the occasional hormonal bump). I've found that PIH leftover from pimple periods also disappear quite fast (they don't linger more than two weeks). Oh and of course, my skin feels super hydrated in the morning!\n\n> Did you end up using the oil as a replacement for another product that was in your lineup?\n\nNope, I don't use it to replace anything. But I know a lot of people can't stand going to bed with a glistening face, so they tend to use the oil as a replacement for night cream.\n\n> AM, PM, or both?\nPM! Unless my skin really, really needs it, or when it's super cold/dry out, I'll add a drop in my moisturizer in the morning.\n\n--\n*Er, sorry for the wall of text, but I hope this helps you a bit!*",

    "body": "**NOTE:** I'm talking about the one with the [green and yellow packaging](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/rohto-mentholatum-hada-labo-gokujyun-oil-cleansing-200ml/info.html/pid.1068397806), NOT the one with the white label on the front.\n\n**WHY I BOUGHT IT**\n\nThis is my first time trying an oil cleanser - I was reluctant to try one for a while because I don't wear makeup, so I thought it would just be a waste. However, I was really interested in the potential to unclog pores, which is what really attracted me to this. This oil cleanser is a cult favourite and it seems to be loved by so many people, as well as being fragrance-free and affordable.\n\n**MY SKIN TYPE/CONCERNS**\n\nI have pretty dry skin most of the time, which was dehydrated but since finding Curel Intensive Moisture Cream acts pretty normal most of the time, although I do have to be speedy about putting skincare on once I cleanse my face. I'm prone to clogged pores on my chin and nose as well as inflammatory acne on my chin, but this has all been massively improved by Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid. Fragrance and essential oils cause acne for me.\n\n**HOW/WHERE I BOUGHT IT**\n\nPurchased on [Stylevana](https://www.stylevana.com/en_GB/rohto-mentholatum-hada-labo-gokujyun-oil-cleansing-japan-version-200ml.html), you can see my full haul [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ipx6hn/haul_stylevana_haul/) for \\~£12 for 200ml.\n\n**HOW LONG I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR**\n\nI've been using this oil cleanser for 3 weeks exactly, once a day in the evening as a first cleanse.\n\n**INGREDIENTS LIST**\n\n*Ethylhexyl palmitate, triethylhexanoin, sorbes tetraisostearate-30, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate,* ***olive fruit oil, water, sodium acetyl hyaluronate, hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, jojoba seed oil***\\*, (palmitic acid / ethyl hexanoic acid), dextrin, butyl carbamate propionyl iodide, BHT\\*\n\nAs you can see, it's a pretty basic ingredients list. Fragrance, essential oil and alcohol free, which is great if you're sensitive to any of those. The main oil here is olive fruit oil - not really much to say, it's quite nice and basic. There's also jojoba seed oil and two types of hyaluronic acid for some extra hydration, although this is a cleanser so there most likely won't be many hydrating benefits.\n\n**SCENT**\n\nNone at all, as you would expect. Does not smell like focaccia or pasta, unlike some other olive-oil based cleansers (according to what people say).\n\n**TEXTURE + EMULSIFICATION**\n\nThis has a very light, fluid texture. The colour is a pale yellow, as you would expect. It spreads really easily over your face and I only need one pump, meaning that it will most likely last me ages. This cleanser emulsifies super super quickly, so whenever I wash my hands before cleansing I have to make sure they are fully dry, as any moisture on them starts to emulsify the cleanser. As it emulsifies so well, it rinses off super quickly.\n\n**EFFECTS + CLEANSING POWER**\n\nI don't wear makeup, nor do I have a Sunscreenr :( so I can't prove how well it removes thick sunscreen or heavy makeup. I have tried it with 3 layers of P20 Kids SPF50+ which it removed really well though. After cleansing my skin feels really soft, plump and hydrated, so I think it's pretty gentle. Due to the fluidity, you also don't have to tug or rub to remove it, which is great.\n\nI don't think it's massively improved my clogged pores but it's pretty hard to tell. I haven't broken out at all this month which is pretty amazing, so maybe it has done it's job. Equally, it could be that the BHA has finally fully cleared up my skin after 2-3 months.\n\n**PACKAGING**\n\nThe packaging isn't cute or fun, but it is really functional. The pump is great - it dispenses the perfect amount of cleanser and it's very easy to use in the shower. The bottle is plastic so it's very shower-friendly and they also sell refills so you can save money and re-use your pump bottle.\n\n**OVERALL THOUGHTS**\n\nI love how it makes my skin feel so soft after cleansing, and it really does cut through layers of sunscreen. Coupled with the easy application, great price and quick emulsification it's a winner in my eyes! It may not be the most exciting cleanser, nor does it have the most fun, cute packaging, but it does what it was supposed to really well - I couldn't ask for more at the price point.\n\n**9/10 - I recommend this product if you want an affordable, fragrance-free and very effective oil cleanser that emulsifies quickly. Definitely WRP, although I might branch out and try a cleansing balm. Does anyone have any fragrance-free suggestions?**",

I don’t have a kid and personally would probably not use anything that has actual feces in it, but short of that my only rule for greywater has been “no touching leaves I’m going to imminently eat.” Every drain in my house (except for the toilet) goes into hoses that go right onto the soil of veggie patches and fruit tree guilds. So far everything’s thriving and I’ve never gotten sick in 6 years of this. I also never store my water for any amount of time, even in winter I make sure the hoses stay clear and shunt everything onto the land. My philosophy is that the pathogens that the greywater contains, if it’s not allowed to sit for any amount of time and reproduce, are going into hostile territory when they reach the soil and will get promptly eliminated by either the sun or other microbes. I also wash produce thoroughly (with the water going back into the yard) and prefer cooking or fermenting vegetables, so that probably helps too.

I'm always on the look out for fragrance-free milk and cream cleansers, and I don't like to spend a lot on them really, I'd rather drop the ££ elsewhere in my routine. This one contains meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil and shea butter, which is nice because I always like a few oils in a second/AM cleanser to replace what's lost when you wash your face. It also contains a couple polymers, which apparently stop surfactants from penetrating too deeply and over cleansing your skin. The high oil content here might even mean that this cleanser can break down makeup and water resistant sunscreens, but I haven't tried it to find out yet!\n\nThe surfactants used don't look particularly interesting and seem few and far between, so perhaps this is a better option for those who use a washcloth or who like cleansers that leave a light emollient film, but I thought I'd share this on here since I've never really seen a cleanser this budget (£2 for 200ml!) with such a good INCI. Presumably it's pretty accessible too since it's Sainsbury's own brand, if it's sold in most stores then it'd be pretty easy just to pick up with your shop. It looks like a great budget option for anyone with dry or sensitive skin - isopropyl myristate can be an acne trigger for some so be mindful of that, but it’s in a good few of my favourite cleansers and despite being super acne prone it never breaks me out.\n\nThey also do a [foaming facial wash](https://incidecoder.com/products/source-of-nature-facial-wash) that looks pretty great too - I don't usually bother with foaming cleansers but the ingredients here look pretty promising and it's £2 for 150ml. Come to think of it, it actually looks more interesting than the milk - lots of glycerin, two really great gentle surfactants, soybean oil, but sadly no polymers unlike the milk. They do a toner and a couple night creams (toner doesn't look up to much but the creams look nice), and an eye makeup remover that might be worth looking into too.

Mineral oil is OK, but Kruidvat didn't have any and was much nicer to use than Nivea (which does have it)... Of course I've tried to find something myself already, but I only find expensive alternatives, or with acne triggers, or something that's not readily available, or someting that is not a true oil cleanser at all.

So, I have dehydrated acne-prone skin and am, despite initially thinking otherwise, probably sensitive to fatty alcohols and certain fatty acids commonly indicated as comedogenic. I've tried a ton of products that break me out in small bumps that come to a head.\n\nI've recently taken to moisturizing with just oils over damp skin, which at least stops me from having that tight skin feeling. Interestingly, coconut oil does not break me out. This keeps me from getting the bumps.\n\nI **LOVE** Nivea Soft. It leaves my skin smooth and soothed, calming down PIE and making imperfections like bumps and pores less visible. It works much better than oil and doesn't leave me shiny. It feels that my skin is \"thicker\" and more resilient. However, I'm pretty sure it breaks me out.\n\nThese are the ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum, **Myristyl Alcohol**, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat, **Stearic Acid**, **Myristyl Myristate**, Cera Microcristallina, **Glyceryl Stearate**, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Lanolin Alcohol (Eucerit®)**, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Dimethicone, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Salicylate, Parfum.\n\nI've bolded the ones that I think are problematic. Sudocrem also breaks me out and it contains lanolin. However, it also seems that these are the ingredients that keep my skin soft and looking good. I'm wondering, are there any emollients that produce this effect without being comedogenic?\n\nGel moisturizers like Sebamed don't give me that soft effect. In addition, they also pill when dry, fall off my face and make makeup application very difficult.\n\nI'm currently moisturizing with a mix of water, glycerin and grapeseed oil, and topping it with coconut oil. I thought that glycerin, being a humectant, would be the key, but it's not doing much besides reducing tightness. I'm open to making my own cosmetics.\n\nEDIT: If you can help, point me to specific ingredients rather than products because the products available to me in Europe are different.",

You said setting spray.. setting sprays usually have water, glycols and some sort of film former like PVP (and preservation system including EDTA). Hydrating face mist contains all the same but more glycols and no pvp. This one is some sort of ‘cream in a liquid format’. Maybe you just make a hydrating mist and knock out the oil? Also you have very weak preservative. Since you don’t mind EDTA and Polysorbate, consider Germaben II. It’s strong and has low irritancy potential (important as you can accidentally spray it close to eyes). It’s also transparent and won’t have impact on the transparency of the product.",

For about the same price point.\n\n/u/vanityrex just [raved](http://vanityrex.com/2015/10/22/neogen-dual-layer-ceramide-oil/) about a NEOGEN's ceramide oil (not the same, I know) but it's an essence/oil packed with a lot of goodness of both niacinamide and oils...and it's FIFTY mLs at a slightly lower price point.\n\nSO, I conclude with this - if you have a product that seems to have a lot of goodness in it, and mL for mL it seems to be CHEAPER than the two other ones I just listed, AND it works really well for you...?

Play Body Mousse SPF 50 and it really was my go-to over the holiday weekend.\n\nThis foam style sunscreen is really unique in that it dispenses/applies like a hair mousse…very cool!\n\nChemical filters are used here but this product is still reef safe. \n\nOne of the things that kept me from loving the Play Everyday Lotion was the high concentration of essential oils (or at least how they responded to my face).\n\nBut, there are no essential oils in the Play Body Mousse but rather coconut oil, jojoba seed oil, and olive fruit oil make an appearance.\n\nThe formulation overall seems much more conducive to being used as a face sunscreen and I had no problem applying it to my entire face and body.\n\nThere is a slightly sweet scent that reminds me of watermelon bubblegum that I really like LOL!\n\nThis Supergoop! Play Body Mousse goes on really lightly without any greasiness and I happily applied several layers a day without issue. \n\nSo happy to have come across this product and it is one that I will certainly be repurchasing!\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nActive Ingredients: Homosalate 15.0%, Octisalate 5.0%, Avobenzone 3.0% \n\nInactive Ingredients: Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Ananas Sativus (Pineapple) Fruit Extract, Bis-Hydroxyethoxypropyl Dimethicone, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cananga Odorata Flower Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Chlorphenesin, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Extract, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Crambe Maritima Leaf Extract, Cucumis Melo Cantalupensis Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extact, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Passiflora Incarnata Fruit Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyester-5, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Rose Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Tocopherol, Trehalose, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Water\n\nWhere To Buy (Supergoop!

Every time I put it on, I can't stop huffing my nails, and I'd absolutely love a perfume with a similar vibe for everyday wear. I think the notes are fruity/floral. It's delicate, clean, and no-fuss. It smells like the universally pleasant smell after you wash your hair with many popular drug store shampoos.\n\n**Can anyone recommend perfumes that smell similar? Cruelty-free brands are preferred.**\n\nHere are some scents in my collection that have a similar vibe to what I'm looking for:\n\n* Fine'ry: Flower bed\n* Floral Street: Sweet almond blossom\n\nHere's the ingredient list in the Essie cuticle oil: Runus armeniaca kernel oil / apricot kernel oil, simmondsia chinensis seed oil / jojoba seed oil, tocopheryl acetate, parfum / fragrance, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, hexyl cinnamal, helianthus annuus seed oil / sunflower seed oil, benzyl alcohol, ci 75120 / annatto, limonene, tocopherol.\n\nEdit: Budget isn't a huge factor since I always buy decants first and luckily prefer 10 mL travel bottles to full-sized :)\n\n# Edit 2: I FOUND IT!\n\n**Osmanthe Liu Yuan by Le Jardin Retrouvé**.  I love the invigorating shampoo-y apricot notes, as well as the added depth and dare I say sexiness from the jasmine and leather notes. I'm normally not a patchouli fan, but it's extremely subtle in this. It just adds to the warm, rich undertones. You can order small 2ml samples directly from their website for \\~$5 USD.\n\nHere are the fragrance descriptions from the website:\n\n* \"You stroll along the galleries of this millenium garden, savouring the different landscapes that reveal themselves to you as you move forward. You approach the water and encounter upright rocks with evocative shapes. On one of them stands a precious bottle. When you open it, a scent escapes. Its notes of osmanthus, peach, leather, jasmine and iris fill your heart with memories and stir your imagination Life here takes on its true meaning.\"\n* Top notes: Mandarin, Blackcurrant, Green notes\n* Heart notes: Osmanthus, Jasmine, Iris\n* Base notes: Peach/Apricot, Patchouli, Leather, Musk",

    "body": "**Product Review: Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion**\n\nAhh…finally able to finalize and share this Review. I have had this Product in my Routing since January LOL! But, because I changed gears and focused on Mad Hippie for the last month…I decided to hold off on this Review until I was done with that Brand. But keep in mind, I used the Centella Multi Lotion the entire time both AM and PM (the Mad Hippie Moisturizer didn’t interest me). Okay, let’s dig in!\n\nThis is a Product that came in a Factory Subscription Box last year. One of the things that I loved (and hated LOL) about their Skincare Box was the curation of Brands I had ZERO familiarity with. I ended up with Serums from CLIV and Puregen and Soroci…never hearing of those names before. This Moisturizer from Pureforet was among them. But, after using this Product for about 6 weeks…I need more of this Brand in my life LOL!\n\nThe parent company of Pureforet (called Ecocation) describes on their site how Pureforet was developed. Of course there is a lot of marketing dollars behind all of this…but basically they claim to offer natural, safe for sensitive/acne prone skin, and economically priced Products to consumers. There is also a page about their social contributions to various organizations. \n\nOkay, let’s talk about the Lotion already! This is a lightweight/slightly watery Emulsion-like Product that applies super evenly and absorbs fairly quickly. It’s one of the lighter Moisturizers that I have used and sits beside the Etude House Soon Jung Emulsion and Cosrx Lotion With Birch Sap in texture/feel.\n\nThe Ingredients List/Formula is where I think this Product really stands out form the others though. There is 74.33% Centella Asiatica here…along with Macadamia Seed Oil, Peptides, Tea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jojoba Seed Oil, Knotweed Root Extract, Skullcap Root Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Chameleon Plant Extract. There are also Essential Oils here…which is a bummer for some. Tea Tree, Clary, and Lavender Oils are all here. But the thing that made me (and my Skin) so happy to see in this Formula was Willow Bark Extract and direct Salicylic Acid (aka BHAs). \n\nPretty much from my first application of this Product…I know my Combination/Sebum Factory Skin was going to like it. The lightweight texture and easy application left a nice/comfortable result that didn’t feel heavy or greasy in any way. But, the addition of Jojoba and Macadamia Oil meant that this Lotion still locked hydration in…unlike other lighter Products. It’s honestly like magic how Pureforet snuck those Oils in!\n\nOver time, I noticed that my Skin was looking generally smoother, softer, and less congested. Then…enter Mad Hippie. Between their Cleansing Oil and Cream Cleanser my Skin started looking more and more congested. Neither of them seemed to be geared towards my Skin type or able to clear my Skin of excess Sebum and Oil. The Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion did its absolute best to keep things at bay…but the poor Lotion could only do so much.\n\nWhat I appreciated was this Product’s ability to keep everything relatively calm and soothed during this trying time (LOL!). This Lotion (I AM NOT KIDDING) is almost instantly soothing and cooling…with redness dissipating in minutes. It was almost like applying a calming Wash-Off Mask without the wait or rinsing. I really feel like this Product kept me away from the ledge just enough…otherwise I may have bailed on the Mad Hippie Brand Review altogether. \n\nHonestly, this Centella Multi Lotion is just a better formulated version of the Cosrx Natural BHA Skin Returning Emulsion (even down to the slightly sweet scent) and I’m okay with that. I feel like the BHA power is a bit stronger here and the calming ability is much more noticeable.\n\nIn the summer months…my Oily/Combination Skin peeps are going to be hard pressed to find a better/more versatile Lotion. Those with Dry Skin might use this as a Serum or PM Lotion under a Night Cream. My previous “Top of Top” (LOL) winners have been the Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion With Birch Sap and the Youth To The People Adaptogen Deep Moisture Cream…I think this Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion might have them both beat. I can’t believe I almost gave this Product away because I was totally in the dark about the Brand. \n\nPureforet makes a Cleansing Water, Toner, Cream, and Balm/Oil in the same Centella Line and I intend on picking up one of each. As for the Lotion…I’ll be setting what I have left aside as a backup in case things go south with other Products in the future. I usually don’t have a hard time moving something out of my Routine (even when I love it)…but temporarily saying goodbye to this Lotion is honestly a struggle LOL!

I came across it about a week ago when several local skincare Instagram accounts received a PR packaged from them and I got curious. \n\nRight now they just released 2 products, a moisturiser and a gel cleanser, and honestly looking from the ingredient list I’m quite impressed. PLUS both seemed to quite affordable I think? \n\nGENTLE CLEANSER\nIngredients: \nAqua, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Propanediol, Ahnfeltiopsis Concinna Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Hydroxy-ethyl Cellulose, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol.\n\nBARRIER DEFENDER \nIngredients:\nAqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Capric/Caprylic Triglyceride, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Ceramide IIIB, Hydrolysed Silk, D-Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol.\n\nHonestly I’m pretty tempted on trying the cleanser because of how simple it is. I’ve always wanted to try a local brand too so for fellow Singaporeans, maybe you guys can give it a try too and share your thoughts on it? \n\nThey’re available on Shopee and their website I think? Do check out their Instagram account if you are interested in them @5to5skin. \n\nMan I guess it’s time for me to quickly use up my current cleanser XD. What are your thoughts on their current products and maybe even their brand as a whole?",

I've not heard of the brand but looking at the price and ingredients, the price looks reasonable based on singapore standards, but really depends on your budget. \n\nThe cleanser based on the ingredients should cleanse relatively fine but can be slightly moisturizing. 1% mark should be at Propanediol. Personally i'd prefer the Glutamate to be the main surfactant but it's probably lower in percentage due to the cost. It's short of an amphoteric surfactant to bring down the potential harshness. \n\nThe moisturizer based on the ingredients should slightly rich due to the number of emollients in the formula. 1% mark should be at Stearic Acid. It should take some time to \"absorb\" due to the Jojoba slightly higher on the list.",

    "body": "I've been using Formulate shampoo and conditioner for about 10 weeks now and I'd like to share my thoughts with you wonderful people who have taught me so much! I was so curious about these before I bought them, but I couldn’t find many reviews from people who follow CGM or have curly/wavy hair.\n\nAbout my hair: I have type 2 (ranging from a-c in different places on my head), fine, medium porosity, protein loving hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length. It has light bleach damage on the bottom 1/4 of it. \n\nAbout my routine: I live in Phoenix, AZ where it is very hot and very dry most of the time. I have pretty hard water, so I switch between using this shampoo and using a light chelating shampoo (Bb Sunday shampoo). I shampoo then condition and STC upside down. I detangle with a wetbrush and drizzle rinse out the conditioner, then using a TON of water, I scrunch in a defining cream, usually AG Re:coil, then glaze and scrunch in Harry's gel. I pixie diffuse to 80% dry and root clip, then SOTC once 100% dry.\n\nFormulate review: I started with the 8oz. size of both shampoo and conditioner (ingredients listed below).  I set my preferences to be no dyes, no anti-brass, silicone free (all formulate products are sulfate and paraben free). There are options to make them vegan and gluten free, but I did not select those.\n\nThe hair concerns I chose for them to base the ingredients off of were number one curl definition (lol wavy probs) followed by improve scalp health, prevent thinning, volumize and anti-frizz. For scent I chose Tidal for my first round (described as Ocean, Sage, Lily and Musk). \n\nI wasn’t really expecting to be that blown away by these. I've tried function of beauty and really didn't like it. I was considering Prose, and got these instead as a way to talk myself out of spending Prose money and I am SO GLAD I DID. I never knew I could love a shampoo and conditioner, I'm not a brand loyal person and almost never get the same thing twice because I like to experiment, but I will not be straying from these anytime soon. The shampoo is A GAME CHANGER. It has so much slip and is so hydrating I could honestly detangle my hair with just the shampoo in it. It feels so good and lathers well, leaves my scalp feeling actually clean. It has a weird consistency, there's a jelly-like substance mixed into a more traditional shampoo-like substance, but it doesn't really bother me at all when I'm using it. The conditioner is similarly amazing - so much slip, super moisturizing. It gives me such good definition, I mean better than most curl definers, that I started drizzle rinsing, something I’ve never done before, to leave some of it in even though it's not meant to be a leave in. It is shocking how much definition and clumping action it gives my hair!! \n\nLike most CGM users, and because I use my chelating shampoo every fourth wash day or so, I went through the conditioner faster than the shampoo and am now on my second bottle. I've sized up so now my conditioner will be 16oz. and my shampoo will be 8oz. I AM IN LOVE. I switched to a new scent because Tidal smells a bit too much like a man for my personal preference. I set my scent level to medium and I will say it does linger, not overpoweringly, but your hair will smell faintly like it even on day 2. \n\nMy formula does contain a little protein in both the shampoo and conditioner. My hair loves protein, so that's cool with me! Plus I feel it helps balance out the moisture. I suspect it's part of the reason I get such good definition from these. If you are considering trying Formulate, I cannot recommend it highly enough and truly feel it is worth every penny. In the past I've tried TGIN, Jessicurl, DevaCurl (pre-scandal) and As I Am, and nothing compares to Formulate, including products from my pre-CGM days.\nPackaging is really nice, although I wish they would offer the sustainable option to just get refills every month instead of new plastic bottles. I love the ease with which you can make edits to formula and cadence and bottle size. Having access to the formulation chemist and technician so you can talk to them if you have concerns or want changes instead of a call-center type of person is a really nice touch. The website has this awesome feature where it will tell you what every single ingredient is and why it’s there, which is so nice if you’re trying to learn more about hair care ingredients. \nI will say they put a weird amount of emphasis on whether you are a “him or a her” in their hair quiz and that’s just so dumb in my opinion. Hair has no gender, I can’t imagine why they need to know this, and they should have more options than the binary if it’s that important to them. Also it’s really hard even once you have an account to circumvent the stupid quiz and just login. Like way more annoying than it needs to be. These are my only complaints though. \n\n\nTL;DR: Very highly recommend these, worth every penny imo!!\n\nIngredients in my shampoo: Purified Water, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Diglycerin, Cocamide MIPA, At Dawn(scent), Methyl Gluceth-20, Guar Gum, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Polyquaternium-7, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-6 Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate, Polyglyceryl-6 Ricinoleate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Argan Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Sesame Seed Oil, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Saw Palmetto, Sweet Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Vitamin C, Beta-Sitosterol, Hemp Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Citrus Fruit Acid, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Broccoli Seed Oil, Aloe Vera\n\nIngredients in my condiitoner: Purified Water, Polyquaternium-7, Diglycerin, At Dawn(scent), Polyquaternium-32, Lecithin, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oilseed Turnip, Butyl Stearate, Polyquaternium-37, Mineral Oil, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Acetamide MEA, Sesame Seed Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Argan Oil, Methyl Gluceth-20, Keratin Oil, Vitamin B5, Sweet Almond Oil, Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Avocado Oil, Oleoyl Sarcosine, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Saw Palmetto, Guar Gum, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Vitamin C, Hemp Seed Oil, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitol, Beta-Sitosterol, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Polysorbate 80, Vitamin E, Jojoba Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid, Wheat Germ Oil, Wheat Germ Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Vitamin E, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Aloe Vera, Broccoli Seed Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Citrus Fruit Acid\n\nEdit: formatting",

My final solution will be neutral to slightly acidic pH (roughly pH 6)\n\nMy oil phase is 11.35% of my total formula (4% jojoba seed oil, 4% argan oil,3% dimethicone 100CST, 0.25% geranium rose oil, 0.10% jasmine oil)\n\nJojoba is 35% of my oil phase with an HLB 6\n\nArgan Oil is 35% of my oil phase with an HLB of 11\n\nDimethicone 100CST is 26% of my oil phase with an HLB of 5 \n\nEssential Oils are <5% of my oil phase with an HLB of ~10 \n\n**Therefore, the oil phase is 11.35% of my solution with an HLB of 7.75**\n\nNow that Ive calculated oil phase percentage of total solution, HLB of oil phase, final solution pH range and identified desired viscosity; I dont know what steps to take next to calculate emulsifier/solubilizer percentage needed. I currently have access to Polysorbate20, which from what I understand is a non-ionic, high HLB (>16 HLB) and good for o/w emulsions without ionic ingredients. Some \"general thumb\" cosmeceutical guides say to use polysorbate blends in a 1:1 ratio with the oil phase and other guides suggesting 1:4 ratio with oil phase. From what I understand, I need to find a low HLB non-ionic emulsifier with low inert viscosity and blend it with polysorbate 20 to get an emulsifier blend with an HLB around 7.75 and test concentrations for solution stability? Help with the next formula steps would be incredibly appreciated!",

I am normally very experimental, and for this last step, I would just prepare a bunch of possible formulations and test their properties. In a controlled and deliberate way, of course. Mind you, with emulsions, it's not only the quantities, but also the order you add them, and the amount and type of stirring you apply.\n\nSome notes from what you said:\n\n* Be sure that the essentials oils, or any other component, are not irritating to you since it's a facial mist.\n* Are you sure dimethicone will dissolve well in oil? I have never used that personally, but AFAIK it's silicone based, and those are very temperamental. They don't like to dissolve much, even in oil, but depends a lot on the oil and concentration.\n* Be wary of solution pH of emulsions, it's not always so straightforward. \n* Nonionic surfactants like polysorbate are good for skin products since they are less irritating than ionic ones, so I think it's a good call.\n* To determine the ideal conditions, you can use something like a factorial design, like they did [in this paper here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517397003682).",

I think it's the same texture as the clear spf lip balm they had last summer, more on the thin side but I prefer that in the summer. There is a very faint vanilla scent, no taste though.",

    "body": "We discovered an infestation 2 weeks ago after I had been trying to diagnose mysterious bites for about 3 months. 3 days of nonstop cleaning, throwing out our bed, vacuum sealing, spreading diatomaceous earth, and $200 worth of plastic bins later, we are crossing our fingers that the situation is contained. This is the first time I've ever experienced an infestation and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to share that during this ordeal I was bitten literally everywhere (yes, all the places you don't want to think about) EXCEPT my face. I can only attribute this to the overpriced face oil I was using: Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was actually annoyed when I received this as a Christmas gift, since I felt like it was a strong hint from my sister in law that my skincare game was subpar, but now I am a devotee. Can't speak to the anti-aging properties since I feel like this bed bug ordeal has aged me 10 years, but it is a great smelling way to keep nasty critters off your face. Looking at the ingredients, it has a lot of crossover from natural bug sprays: \n\nCAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE  \nDICAPRYLYL CARBONATE  \nSQUALANE  \nROSA CANINA FRUIT OIL  \nOENOTHERA BIENNIS OIL / EVENING PRIMROSE OIL  \nSIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS OIL / JOJOBA SEED OIL  \nCORIANDRUM SATIVUM OIL / CORIANDER SEED OIL  \nTOCOPHEROL  \nLAVANDULA ANGUSTIFOLIA OIL / LAVENDER OIL  \nPELARGONIUM GRAVEOLENS FLOWER OIL  \nLINALOOL  \nROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS LEAF OIL / ROSEMARY LEAF OIL  \nCITRONELLOL  \nGERANIOL  \nLAVANDULA HYBRIDA OIL  \nCUCUMIS SATIVUS EXTRACT / CUCUMBER FRUIT EXTRACT  \nCURCUMA LONGA EXTRACT / TURMERIC ROOT EXTRACT  \nLIMONENE  \nCITRAL  \nSCLAREOLIDE  \nROSA SPP / ROSE FLOWER OIL  \nJASMINUM OFFICINALE EXTRACT / JASMINE EXTRACT  \nHELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED OIL / SUNFLOWER SEED OIL\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, just sharing my endorsement for this stuff if you're trying to save your face and neck from bedbugs. It was just a happy accident that I was using it while the infestation was brewing.",
