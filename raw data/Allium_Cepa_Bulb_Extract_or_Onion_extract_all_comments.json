There’s proooobably no harm in putting the stuff if your hair. And based on the above, it’s plausible there are benefits in using onion extract in haircare. I wouldn’t dare tout it as a miracle remedy or magic potion though.\n\nSimply because that’s not really how hair growth works. At the end of the day, genes, diet, and stress levels triumph over everything else. Skincare topicals are akin to hitting a nail with a thick book— the nail will probably go down, but isn’t near as impactful as, say, hitting the nail with a big metal mallet. Covering the scalp in coconut oil means nothing if one is holding a match to their hair on a daily basis and physically pulling their hair out.\n\nMy point is that ingredients like these should be supplemental to your hair growing journey, not be the leading star. Keep away from abrasives, protect the hair from too much moisture, be gentle combing, trim your ends, kiss your strands gently before sleeping so they know they’re loved. And then go ham on the onions and topicals.",

Most of my concern is with the hyperpigmentation that is left from healed acne.\n\nMost of the hyperpigmentation spots go away after a few days or weeks. But there's one - it started to appear from an acne near my upper cheek around 6 months ago and is still visible. Its size is 0.8cm in length and 0.2cm wide. It is slightly depressed (it is possible that it can be considered an [Atrophic scar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar#Atrophic)). It seems to be lightening up, but it's been visible for too long, compared to other hyperpigmentation spots I get, which usually disappear in days or weeks.\n\n**What are good ways to get rid of hyperpigmentation (red/dark red scars) from acne?** I'm currently looking at onion-extract based creams or gels like [Mederma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mederma), or vitamin A-based creams or gels like Retin-A ([Tretinoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tretinoin)). Though, from reading [Mederma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mederma)'s Wikipedia article, it seems that is not yet proven to be effective definitively (studies are divided about its effectivity).
