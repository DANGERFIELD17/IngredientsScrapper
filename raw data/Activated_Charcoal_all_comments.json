Activated charcoal is actually very effective because it bonds to alien molecules preventing your body from digesting them. Poison control uses activated charcoal to prevent people from overdosing or digesting toxins.\n\n The issues is, activated charcoal can't distinguish between alien substances we choose to put in our bodies like prescription medications and more harmful ones. As a result, people are finding activated charcoal interferes with their prescription medication including antibiotics and birth control. If you are taking part in the new trend, please be mindful of how it will effect your medication.\n\nEdit: To clarify, you have to ingest the activated charcoal for it to interfere with medications, face washes and such should not cause this specific issue. I do not know enough about all activated charcoal products to answer peoples specific questions and reccomend some but not others.\n\nLots of comments arguing there is not enough in toothpaste to interfere with medications.  My doctor warned to stop using it and following so, my birth control stopped being weird (extra periods and whatnot). Regardless, numerous self-identified dentist in the comments have warned activated charcoal toothpaste damages your enamel and causes dental problems. Will specifically reccomend not to use this one.",

        "body": "Both can happen, and it depends on the drug in question. So first of all what hasn't been mentioned so far is that grapfruit juice blocks the enzyme CYP3A4 _irreversibly_, meaning that the liver has to produce new enzymes to get back on track. That's why the effect of grapfruit juice can last several days. Now when a drug is taken orally, it has to go through the liver before it enters the bloodstream. A certain amount of the drug is already removed by the liver enzymes (like CYP3A4) during this, which is called the [first pass effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect). The degree to which that happens depends on the drug and is studied super-carefully during drug development. Drug doses are chosen with that effect in mind, but of course always assuming a normally functioning liver. So when 50% of CYP3A4 are not working as they should, the drug isn't degraded as much as it should, meaning a higher dose enters the bloodstream. This of course can have adverse effects, especially if the drug has a small therapeutic window (the dose range between a reliable effect and toxicity, basically). So in that case grapefruit juice increases effectiveness, potentially to the point of an overdose.\n\n\nNow, some drugs work by a different mechanism. They are called [prodrugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug). A prodrug is a molecule that in its administered form does not have any effect (or only very weak effects). These drugs rely on liver enzymes to convert them into their active form. So in that case, grapefruit juice decreases effectiveness, because the liver does not convert the prodrug quickly enough to reach therapeutic levels in the blood. \n\n\nProdrugs can be funny, btw. A prominent example is codeine, which is converted to morphine by a liver enzyme called CYP2D6. When codeine is adminstered for a cough, the dose is chosen so that the resulting concentration of morphine in the blood is just high enough to prevent the coughing, but not send you into a full-blown opioid high. Now, there is some genetic variation in CYP2D6 among people. About 10% of white people are _poor metabolisers_ (as opposed to only approx. 2% of African-Americans, for example). For those people, Codeine isn't effective. A much smaller fraction, around 1-2% of white people, are so-called _ultra-rapid metabolisers_. They have either more CYP2D6 in their liver than other people, or their variant of the enzyme is much more active. Now what happens when an ultra-rapid metaboliser takes Codeine for a cough? They get high as fuck, that's what happens. Because their liver metabolises all the codeine at once, causing morphine levels way beyond what's intended.",

They press it into smaller bits with more surface area.\n\nCarbon like that has a lot of porous area where chemical *adsorption* can occur. Adsorption is like absorption, kind of, in that your material is \"sucking up\" something from a liquid or gas. In the case of adsorption, atoms and molecules stick to the surface area of your material. Charcoal, particularly activated charcoal, has a *lot* of surface area, so it can adsorb a *lot* of stuff and it can do it quickly and efficiently, and also cheaply.\n\n~~That's why they use charcoal to pump your stomach when you have alcohol poisoning. The carbon sucks up all the alcohol, then they remove the saturated carbon from your stomach, bringing the alcohol with it. What carbon remains to go through your digestive tract contains the alcohol so you can't absorb it into your blood.~~ [^^Or ^^not ^^maybe?](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7hmd8m/eli5_how_does_activated_charcoal_work_and_why_has/dqs6r6a/) ^^I ^^dunno, ^^point ^^is ^^it ^^sucks ^^up ^^poisonous ^^stuff ^^in ^^your ^^stomach.\n\nIt's also used in aquariums to suck up waste in the water so it can be removed when you change your filter. It's especially good at removing heavy metals, which are sometimes present in your water at concentrations that are not high enough to hurt you but high enough to hurt your livestock. Similarly, it's used in water purification systems (like your Brita filter) to similarly suck up some stuff in your tap water that you are trying to filter out. EDIT: And some gas masks, and industrial air pollution scrubbers, and a number of similar filtering applications. It's quite good at actually sucking up toxic chemicals. Just, you know...not out of your face.\n\nThat tendency to suck up heavy metals has created a mystique about it, that it sucks up \"toxins\". If it can purify your water, why not purify your skin? It can suck up \"toxins\" out of your face! (Pro tip: it doesn't.)\n\nEdit: when they make you swallow charcoal for a pill overdose or swallowing poison, *it does nothing to the drugs or poison in your blood*. If you still have some left in your stomach, it soaks that up so that your OD or poisoning doesn't get any worse. What's in your blood is still there and has to be dealt with in other ways.",

It adsorbs basically any substance. That includes any medication you might need (eg birth control or antibiotics) and also nutrients! So misuse can lead to ineffective meds and malnutrition.\nIf you don't have to take any meds and are generally a healthy human, nothing bad comes from eating activated charcoal every once in a while.

Organic glue in the sense that it wants to stick to (make bonds with) other atoms.  Most carbon-carbon bonds are very stable, but this doesn't mean that anything carbon bonds with forms a stable bond.  A good example of reactive bonds that carbon forms are bonds to metals (alkyl lithium reagents and Grignard reagents).  These is very useful to take advantage of in synthetic chemistry, but these kinds of bonds don't really form in nature, and if they did, they'd be very short lived.  In life carbon mostly bonds to carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and hydrogen.\n\ntl;dr 1. Activated charcoal is \"sticky\" due to it's high surface area. 2.

It's really just people not researching the mechanisms of what they're putting into their body.\n\nAs far as reducing your ability to absorb vitamin C/B, [as well as biotin and niacin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2004.tb00647.x), the charcoal will only grab those molecules (as well as just about everything else in it's path) until it's completely saturated (doesn't take long) - at which point, the effect ends. But it's mechanism doesn't change something physiologically in your body that makes your body unable to absorb nutrients or other medications. If you're concerned about your body not absorbing vitamins/minerals or even other medications because of activated charcoal, you just need to wait an hour or two between when you eat and take your charcoal. Even [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11139541) done on 11 women to observe the effects of activated charcoal and birth control showed no correlation between it's use and \"follicular activity\" when they took 5g of activated charcoal 4 times a day, but starting 3 hours after they took their birth control.\n\nMedications frequently interact with one another and that's why doctors and pharmacists exist to watch out for those potential interactions and weigh the risks for you (or at least warn you of side effects). The problem is that supplements aren't regulated and can just be bought off the shelf with all kinds of \"promises\" but \"Sally's sister's cousin's mom's friend said that this natural remedy takes care of *this*\" isn't a reliable source for what/how/why that supplement actually does what it does, and how it may interact with your body and other medications you're taking. \n\nAt the end of the day, always ask your doctors, folks!",

The birth control isn’t 100% effective to begin with (and neither are lots of other medications).

There is a certain speed below which a softer material won't scratch a harder material at all. Tooth brushing could exceed that speed however, would be an interesting study.  \n\nThe study of wearing is so cool, i like the examples of nail files, and scissors, it's a real internet rabbit hole to fall into!

I do a straight substitution of simple syrup for any cocktail I attempt with it and adjust from there. I have been told different trees can produce a wide spectrum of flavors as the tree has not been significantly grown by humans and it is fairly localized to a specific region of North America.\n\nMost likely not something you have access to but just thought I would throw this otherwise unknown ingredient into the ring.\n\nHere are a few drinks I made, excuse the poor photography: https://imgur.com/a/jdbEiYI\nI made sure to include the alcohol I used so you can recreate it yourself to see the exact change in color I'm getting.

I was getting pretty sick of those, so decided to try to make a cocktail based around the other half of the holiday name. I wanted it to look like the night sky. \n\nHere's the approximate recipe: \n\n* 1 oz Shortpath summer gin (made with blueberries and so has kind of a purple color)\n\n* .5oz blue Curaçao (Drillaud)\n\n* 0.25 oz \"Yes Cocktail\" blackberry pomogranate mixer\n\n* 0.25 oz homemade blackberry sage simple syrup (just made a regular simple, and simmered with mashed up blackeberries and sage from my garden, then strained) \n\n* ~0.5 oz lemon juice\n\n* edible cocktail glitter for the stars (edit: I used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BN8L6LW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1), which does add some color, but not much because I added only a small amount. Black color can be achieved without it). \n\n* topped with Lemon spindrift (a seltzer brand that contains a bit of actual juice) and served over ice, with a lemon \"moon\" garnish. \n\nThe color is basically jet black, but with a dark blue-ish purple tinge. The taste is light and fruity, but with a woodsy quality from the sage. A great representation of a summer night in Massachusetts.",

She took in this chipmunk, named it \"Chippy\" and nursed it back to health. In return for her kindness the wise gods of the forest decreed that my mother and her descendants would once a year for all of time be blessed by a visit from the Squirrel of the Night. On March 9th (*we delayed this year's party due to the omicron surge*) of every year this magnificent rodent of nocturnal leanings will bless our family with a gift of nuts and candy.\n\n>The story of the healed chipmunk named Chippy is entirely true!

Then add orange flower water  - it always seems to me that you want more than is in the recipes (you can follow a standard orgeat recipe but just switch the almonds out for pine nuts). Orange flower water isn't like rose water where just a tiny amount makes it go from tasty to soapy, at least with the one I had been using.\n\nBut holy shit are these Mai Tais phenomenal.

Air is then introduced to burn out the gasses, creating a graded, screened and de-dusted form of activated carbon.

The chemical is typically an acid, strong base[1][2], or a salt[16] (phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, calcium chloride, and zinc chloride 25%). Then, the raw material is carbonized at lower temperatures (450–900 °C).

She is still at the vet receiving medications, and is also receiving plasma and vitamin K.

It has not spiked further up which means damage has come to a head and should trend downwards from here. It wasn’t much, but any positive trend is a blessing. \nYesterday, platelets were 0. Now they are slightly increased. Not much, but they are there. \n\nGuarded news: coagulation panel is still significantly elevated and in addition, bilirubin has increased. This means the functions of the liver are significantly impaired and will still need support via plasma transfusions, vitamins K. The liver still needs time to regenerate. \n\nShe is drinking and holding down water with assistance of anti nausea medications. Solid foods are not yet tolerated as well. The vets suspect a small stomach ulcer may have developed. It’s not bleeding since her vomit does not have that coffee ground appearance consistent with blood. \n\nThe vets are in daily contact with poison control, consulting on treatment plans. \n\nRegardless, It’s a small victory for today. Thank you r/husky family for your continued  support, positive thoughts, and prayers for Stormy. Please keep them coming. \n\nMuch love to you all. Good night for now. ❤️🫶❤️",

I used a syringe to squirt the blue and green soap through the little hole in the top of the molds. They looked pretty cool as globes, but I cut one in half to see the cross section and it looked even better, so I made enough to do a 10\" loaf. What I like about using the spheres for this soap is depending where I cut it, I can get all different sizes of Earths. Each bar has a big Earth on one side and a small Earth on the other side. I didn't even have a proper column mold for the moon, but I managed to do alright with a silicone bubble tea straw and some duct tape 😁",

As your exhalation moistens the physical filter that you've installed (creating the wet rag effect). Activated charcoal yes can trap some contaminants, but it's unlike a proper filter, it is not guaranteed to trap any particles, but has the capability to, it's just more passive. The one bonus about what you have posted is a does increase vision in smokey scenarios if it's covering your face. I'll wet rag does nothing for your vision, and in smoke/gas it won't help at all.\n\nI guess the point I'm trying to make is a DIY gas mask also needs to be on your person, cannot be obtained on the fly, and has many drawbacks. But it is not useless, and can be better in many scenarios. I would just like to add that the wet rag can literally be attained by ripping clothing off your body and peeing on it if need be. Disgusting, but if it saves your life, or the life of your family member besides you. I don't mind the disgusting nature of it at that point.",

Just remember to smack your mixing bucket continuously between scoops of confetti, to get rid of air pockets as you mix, and smack your mold hard several times when you're done pouring. I did have a bit under a half pound of confetti leftover, but I think it will depend mostly on the size of your chunks and how liquid your batter is. The white version I made with larger chunks didn't \"take\" as much, but also the trace was a tad thicker. So, in conclusion, prepare for 50/50 but don't be surprised if some of the confetti doesn't \"fit\".",

When selling in person, or via text I ask the customer if they are allergic to anything before recommending any bar, and that's pretty much it.

As such, any substance in your stomach and small intestine is vulnerable to charcoal absorbtion. \n\n\nThis means that practically every oral medication can be affected by consumption of activated charcoal. Aside from the aforementioned ones, charcoal can also affect antidepressant and antipsychotic effectiveness. \n\n\nWith that said, though, it's nothing too serious to worry about. Your bread probably does not contain all that make activated charcoal, and risks regarding charcoal affecting medication are minimal: websites like WebMD suggest that it should be fine as long as you eat charcoal an hour or more *after* taking medication, and long before having to eat medication.",

It tastes just like normal sourdough bread. \n\nRecipe:\n\n3 Color Sourdough Swirl Bread - Makes 3 x 650g loaves\n\nUse 3 different bowls to make your dough.\n\nBowl 1:\n330g bread flour\n230g water\n66g starter at peak\n7g salt\n\nBowl 2:\n315g bread flour\n230g water\n66g starter at peak\n7g salt\n15g dragonfruit powder\n\nBowl 3:\n315g bread flour\n230g water\n66g starter at peak\n7g salt\n15g activated charcoal powder\n\nMix each dough into a shaggy ball and rest 30 minutes. 3x stretch and fold on the hour. Laminate each dough and lay it on top of each other to create a single batch, then fold and roll to create swirl (IDK, just go for it). Move dough into clear straight-sided container until increased 75% in volume. Divide, preshape and rest 10 mins on counter. Shape and place in prepared bannetons and rest on counter another 30 mins. Move to fridge for overnight cold proof. Bake the next morning 20 mins at 475F with ice cube and DO lid on, 18 mins at 450F lid off.",

They go over safety and help you understand things like trace, and starting with a tried and true recipe always helps (and you can learn to tinker with and make your own recipes down the road). Brambleberry even sells their own pre-mixed oil blends and making soap becomes as simple as putting the bag in the microwave and adding the lye and stick blending without having to measure out individual oils. \n\nIt's a super fun hobby (be warned, it's addictive!). I started with something simple (a single colored lavender soap) and progressed to swirls and eventually landscape soaps like these.

There are issues with sourcing all oils so it’s good to find a company that is actually ethical but omitting palm altogether is an easy thing to do to not contribute to the terrible things happening with palm oil production.

But I don't see how gold leaf would do any harm, and I am honestly doubtful that activated charcoal would do all that much harm either.\n\nPeople are always worried about it interfering with medication. But that assumes that you ingest pure activated charcoal that didn't have a chance to adsorb any other compounds. That wouldn't really be the case when you mix it with food. In fact, I'd assume for it to be mostly inactive by the time you are done with cooking.\n\n\n**Edit:** Reddit at its best. Lots of downvotes without anybody making an effort to actually respond to the argument. So, let me try to explain.\n\nAs for gold leaf, gold is chemically completely inert. That's the whole reason why gold is valued so much. It doesn't react with anything that you could normally throw at it outside of a chemical lab. If you eat it, it just passes through your body. And since it is uniquely suited to making insanely thin foils from it, most food applications only use a few cents of gold. In other words, it's a gimmicky decoration trend, but it neither costs a fortune nor does it affect your health. If you don't agree, please offer an actual reason why you think so.\n\nAs for activated char coal, the ELI5 explanation is that it acts like an enormously porous sponge. Combine it with any kind of fluid, and it adsorbs (i.e sticks to the surface) pretty much anything that comes in contact with it. It's very efficient at doing this, as it has a huge surface area. But even then, there is only so much it can adsorb. If you use it in an emergency to adsorb accidentally ingested poison, you need about 10 times as much activated charcoal compared to the poison that you want to remove. According to the papers that I have found, it takes at most 30min to have done all that it can do.\n\nI found one paper that tested first taking Tylenol and then administering activated charcoal. If there was more than about an hour between both events, it was impossible to measure any effect from the charcoal. I wasn't able to find any research paper on what happens when you ingest both chemicals in the opposite order, first activated charcoal, then your medication. But I found several suggestions that, again, a one hour delay is likely to suppress all of the effects, because the activated charcoal would have depleted its potential at that time. That's in agreement with papers that mention that after 30 minutes, charcoal has reached its equilibrium state with the environment.\n\nNow, all of these discussions assume that you ingest a slurry of activated charcoal. But if you cook with it, that's very different. You combine the charcoal with the food. And from that moment on, the clock starts ticking. The charcoal starts adsorbing all the various naturally occurring chemicals in your food. And at most 30 minutes later, the \"sponge\" is full. It can't adsorb any more than that.\n\nSo, again, my argument is that if you mix charcoal into your food and then wait a few minutes before serving it, it will have minimal health effects, pass straight through your body, and turn out to be no more than a gimmicky food decoration. If you don't agree with this line of reasoning, please explain why.",

It's pretty benign and harmless for most people (assuming you don't actually rely on medication; and even then, it rarely matters) and it actually can help with a variety of ailments. So, honestly, it's not a bad idea to try before going for more serious medical treatment.\n\nThe downside is that if you later discover that you should have taken antibiotics after all, they might not work as expected unless the activated charcoal has either been flushed from your system or is fully saturated. The latter is likely going to happen relatively quickly, though.\n\nI can't find any published research for this exact question in a very quick search that I did, but I saw some suggestions that even an hour later it should be perfectly safe to take regular medication. And the inverse is true, too. If you eat activated charcoal an hour after taking medication (except for time release medication), you probably won't notice any effect. I actually did find a paper that verified this.\n\nSuffice it to say, I ingested plenty of activated charcoal when I grew up. Not really any flavor. But the texture is a little gritty and odd. I could see that being off putting for some patients.\n\nThe upshot is that it probably doesn't do either much harm nor much good in food. By the time you ingest it, I'd expect it to be saturated. So, you'll get slightly less nutrients from the same food. But everything else should be unchanged. As others have said, it's rather gimmicky.",

    "body": "We need to talk about activated charcoal. I've noticed that almost every terrarium guide out there recommends adding a layer of activated charcoal, but nobody seems to be questioning this practice. After doing some research, I've come to a conclusion: activated charcoal / a charcoal layer in terrariums is useless, and we're all wasting money on it. Here's my thinking, but looking for others' thoughts too:\n\n1. **Activated charcoal becomes inert over time.** Sure, it starts off as a powerful adsorbent, but it has a limited capacity. In a terrarium, once it's under your substrate, you can't replace it. So even if it did something useful (spoiler: it doesn't), it would only do it for a short time.\n2. **The mechanics are fundamentally flawed.** Think about how water moves in a terrarium. The tiny amount of water that might drip through the charcoal layer isn't enough for significant filtering. More importantly, water returns to the substrate through evaporation and condensation - a process that naturally filters out impurities. The charcoal layer is redundant at best.\n3. **It's solving imaginary problems.** Everyone talks about the charcoal removing \"toxins,\" but what toxins are we talking about? I haven't found any issues on toxins creating issues in terrariums and never had a problem with it myself so why would i be trying to combat them? A healthy terrarium doesn't need this kind of intervention.\n4. **Microbes aren't the enemy.** Some sources claim the charcoal provides antimicrobial benefits. But here's the thing: many microorganisms in a terrarium are beneficial. They break down decaying matter and keep the nutrient cycle going. Plus, who doesn't love seeing an occasional mushroom pop up?\n5. **It's a waste of money.** Activated charcoal isn't cheap. That $10-$20 you're spending on charcoal could go towards a cool new plant, better lighting, or higher quality substrate. Why spend money on something that's not adding value to your terrarium?\n\nNow, it's worth noting that some substrate mixes do include non-activated charcoal, which can help with drainage and provide some benefits. But that's different from the activated charcoal layer we're talking about here.\n\nI wrote a more in-depth discussion on [my blog](https://www.getanyplant.com/blog/charcoal_in_terrarium) which goes into each of these points in greater detail. I just wanted to share the bullet points here to hopefully save some of you a few bucks.\n\nSo, what's your take on this? Are there other benefits of a charcoal layer that I missed?",

        "body": "I agre with most of your points, but I would point out a few caviats:\n\n1. For new Terrarium builders, an activated charcoal sprinkle above the barrier layer and before the sphagnum layer is better than nothing, and a good buffer for the bad few first weeks when something as annoying as your tap water may actually crash your terrarium with chlorine/chloramine/fluorite/whatever else is added. Some water municipalities will actually flush the system with more of their purifiers if they detect higher than normal microorganisms, and this can really, negatively effect a new terrarium if you \"Time it wrong\", killing many of the active bioorganisms you need to run your tank. This is also why you should always set up with distilled or RODI water. And if you do so, the Charcoal is unnnecessary.\n\n2. This is also why a barrier layer and mixing it with the spagnum is important. For some reason, people tend to sprinkle it straight on the reservoir stones, or make it it's own layer, but you want it to be in your water retention/exchange zone that pulls water from the reservoir and discharges it to the soil so it's in maximum effectiveness. With that said, it's effect will be minimal, and only last a few weeks to 2 months at most before the charcoal is deactivated and \"Full\"\n\n3. Horticulturally marketed Activated charcoal can be expensive, aquarium activated charcoal is not, and they're the same thing. [Marineland Activated charcoal](https://www.amazon.com/MarineLand-Diamond-Premium-Activated-Carbon/dp/B0002APZY4/ref=sr_1_6?crid=36IJ0MHG2UUGE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5T-evFKD0k8L5_hSAY10ehvHs9_-GcrgEYmUOJaK3OjT3v6OJdtGDR_Oqw4P3hD71sp-QsoKeedq4rDC5dP6PmrfUphAoycAD7vq_YIGxeEJ_0yRo4RXEVQQ8p3OnCCYPfVoXbVTZyNEXLBpONTD8Ow9Oewmxe02yOlUAC_rAJyw_InJGZXk5r2il-HxTqC7Eb_DaAuVlauFTLi9sCPRCxUvkGSWAgZIjkGc0SOAXbX9GObWbmakzcsAcn03BfMqLXh5Py9QOPolRJ5NKmXPxovaT8I4SEWe1lSeJ6uJFIQ.ng7GNK3YFw4VL6329zybw_Weaogt4OTd1rcAJhz23x8&dib_tag=se&keywords=activated+charcoal+aquarium&qid=1723473085&sprefix=activated+charcoal+aquarium%2Caps%2C269&sr=8-6) is completely safe to use in terrariums and a jar is only $5 . If used appropriately, this container would be enough for a 40 gallon breeder sized terrarium,when sprinkled before or on top of the sphagnum layer.\n\n4. Charcoal is not the same as activated charcoal, and this is where the cost descrepancy can really be from. There is Horticultural charcoal that is used to add water retention + faster draining as a soil additive, then there is activated charcoal. If your charcoal doesn't sound like a pack of poprocks does when in your mouth when you get it wet, it's not activated charcoal. Regular Charcoal is a great soil additive for terrariums. It helps with making the soil more loose, and helps with springtails and other decayers. It should NOT be used instead of activated charcoal. When guides tell you to use activated charcoal, you don't use horticultural charcoal.\n\nWith all of that said, I've never used it, specifically because I'm used to how it's used in Aquaria(Only when medicating, to remove medication from the water column, never as a constant thing), so I'm familiar with what it removes and what it doesn't, and also use only distilled to start and water my terrariums.",

I implore you to experiment with it. Mix up some substrate for two cuttings and add 5-10% charcoal to one of the mixes. Provide them with identical conditions otherwise.

Aquarium activated charcoal is the same as any other set of activated charcoal you'll get, and usually cheapest. It's why you Soak or rinse things like new brita fitler inserts before using the jar, and why you have to get new ones. They rely heavily on activated charcoal to filter the water. This is what you're looking to do in your terrarium. This is also why you dont' just \"Mix\" it into the soil, but put it in the layer that has the most water exchange, just above the soil barrier and water reservoir with the sphagnum moss that creates the wick to rehydrate the soil. There's also no reason for thick layers, and the pictures of terrariums with thick layers are just for aesthetic reasons. There's absolutely no physical reason to do thiick layers of anythign besides the drainage layer and the soil layer.\n\nHorticultural charcoal is basically just... burned wood. It's used purely to add porousness and allow faster draining of soil, so it becomes an additive that you mix in for aroid soils, etc. It doesn't do any \"Absorbing\" of nasty stuff or impurities in water/soil. Horticultural ACTIVATED charcoal is the same as the stuff for fish tanks, but oftentimes much more expensive. They're two different products, but many people don't realize it.\n\nActivated charcoal, once you get it wet, you'll hear what I mean. It'll  sound like a sizzling steak. This is because it's been cooked in a certain way to want to DRAW IN moisture, and thus contaminants. After 2 months, it's \"Deactivated\", no longer drawing in moisture and contaminants. Nor is there any real \"leaching back\" of what it's accumulated at that point. Once it's deactivated, it becomes no different than thin grade horticultural charcoal.\n\nThat's why it's a good thing to start with, but not something you should count on perminently being a purifying element in your terrarium, By the time the Activated charcoal has deactivated, you will have want to have springtails and isopods at work doing proper decomposing for you.\n\nEdit: I also want to thank you for asking for clarification EVEN on a very old post. People like you who \"necro\" to ask questions in these forums are why I try to word my responses towards everyone and not just the person I'm talking to, because learning about these things and being able to get answers is very important, even if it comes from an older source! I hope your son's project goes well!",

This is often already included in some soil mixes, but it doesn't hurt to add more. The Springtails love this stuff. Usually it comes in much chunkier pieces, think orchid bark, but sometimes comes in something more like flakes. If you want THIS item specifically, make sure you aren't getting the fine flake variant. it's not as effective for springtail habitat.\n\nActivated Charcoal is charcoal that has been baked in such a way that they become extremely light, porous, and they constantly are drawing \"in\" water, and whatever is in the water. It tends to capture minute impurities that may be added in, like chlorine, chloramine, etc, and is used in the same way one would an aquarium: The filter is not meant to be always wet, but have water moving over it. Putting this in the layer that is supposed to be always wet and moving water from the reservoir to the soil is why this works, but it tends to be smaller fragments instead of chunks. \n\nPeople often confuse one for the other. It's an  important distinction, especially since one is not the other, and do not act the same as the other, and one is generally finer than the other. If you want extra springtail habitat, I would suggest larger chunk charcoal, often marketed for orchids to add to the soil. If you want that \"cushion\" for a new terrarium and do not have easy access to distilled or RODI water, you put activated charcoal above the barrier cloth.\n\nThere's absolutely no reason to add activated charcoal into either the soil, or straight into the barrier substrate(stones, leca, etc). That's why guides are a little all over the place\n\nCheck out Serpadesigns on youtube, He does a TON of terrariums, from small ones only built for springtails and isopods, to huge ones to house his frogs and reptiles. I started initially with following his videos, doing my own research on the side. I really, even years later, find zero fault in his work.",

The most common way to remove bacteria is chlorination. Also if the charcoal is literally just sitting in there, it will eventually need to be replenished. The water needs to pass through it, it just can’t sit there?\n\nIt makes zero sense to put activated charcoal into your terrarium.

    "body": "Ok so I have been dealing with candida for 8 years.  I developed multiple health problems in the process and a year ago when I finally figured out what the problem was I started trying to heal. \n\nFor the last year I took about 30k in supplements in a year and the diet was unbearable. I genuinely couldn't eat anything besides chicken or steak, it could only be seasoned with salt and pepper, and I could only drink water. That's literally all I ate for a year.\n\nI gained a ton of weight over 8 years even though I couldn't eat, and once I started trying to clear it I lost almost 90lbs and my weight got dangerously low along with my blood pressure. But no matter what I did I COULD NOT GET RID OF IT!\n\nAnytime i tried even 1 or 2 bites of another food all my symptoms immediately came back. Horrible bloating,  skin rashes, my joints would hurt so bad i could barely move, I'd be so exhausted walking into the next room would wear me out, I'm sure everyone in this group knows what I'm talking about.\n\nWell a couple of weeks ago I did a 9 day charcoal cleanse. I used the brand from Codeage called full spectrum binders. Now let me say this, I would not recommend this unless you have a minimum of a week you don't have to get out of bed!\n\nIt was awful for 6 days I thought I was dying and prayed I just would! I've never had headaches like that and my body has never hurt worse. It felt like i had been in a head on collision!  My joints hurt so bad that just trying to pick up my arm to move it, the joint would feel like it was going to snap. Also the amount of sweat was wild. For 6 nights I slept in a hoodie and sweatpants because I was freezing,  but waking up in the morning I had sweat completely through the hoodie and pants, through the towel I was sleeping on, through the sheets all the way down to the mattress. \n\nWhen I washed my bedding there were tons of pieces of a black film in the washer from what I was sweating out and it was a lot.  When i tell you this was bad, there aren't words to describe how bad it truly was.\n\nBut since I finished it, I've been able to add some foods back in and im having no reactions to the foods at all. This is the first time in 8 years that's happened. So far I've only added eggs, pecans,  veggies,  and low sugar fruits. But the fact that I can even eat fruit is crazy because I never thought I'd be able to eat fruit again. \n\nIm only doing berries for fruit right now, so strawberry,  blueberries, Raspberries and black  berries. So far for veggies ive had asparagus,  green beans, zucchini, broccoli and yellow squash.\n\nI am going to stick with my diet the way it is now ( meat,  veggies,  fruit,  nuts) for atleast 3 months before I attempt to add back in any kind of dairy like yogurt or cottage cheese. As far as high carbs foods like bread, pasta, rice, potatoes etc. I may add those back in VERY small doses ( once in a while treat) in 6 months to year depending on how I do when I try to add back in dairy.\n\nOver the last 8 years i woke up every day wishing I would just die so I didn't have to live like this anymore.  The mental and physical toll of only being able to tolerate the same 2 foods for every meal was the most hopeless feeling I've ever experienced and I didn't think it was ever going to end. But 5 days into the cleanse I could feel myself starting to produce stomach acid on my own again for the first time in almost a decade.\n\nI am off ALL of my supplements except my probiotics. I take the megasporebiotics probiotc, and I take their Restore Flora (their s.boul. product).\n\nI am not a doctor and I am not recommending anyone do this without their physicians approval. But after seeing dozens of doctors who never helped me AT ALL, I had to do all of this on my own and I know there are probably lots of people in this group dealing with the same thing.\n\nPlease just heed my warning this was a VERY intense detox process.  Please don't attempt it unless you have a solid week you can stay in bed. I never thought I would eat again, and I definitely never thought I'd be supplement free ever again in my entire life, but here I am. Eating foods, and not taking pills for anything besides probiotics, and having zero reactions to the foods I've added back in.\n\nI hope this can help someone because I've been as depressed and hopeless as humanly possible because of this disease. It robbed me of almost an entire decade of my life. Every birthday,  vacation,  holiday ruined because eating is not just a necessity,  but also an enjoyment on occasions like those. I didn't think it was ever going to end but ive literally been crying happy tears because tasting foods without becoming deathly ill has  finally gone from a dream to a reality. \n\nI hope it can help someone else too. Praying everyone in this group finds a way to get well again.",

Also checking the house for mold growth.\n\nEdit: Charcoal could pull out toxins and the immune system gets back online and manages the candida. This is typical for people with mycotoxins, but it takes much, much longer in most cases. That's why I think OP has just mold in his gut.",

Activated charcoal, from what I understand, is part of these protocols. \n\nBut did you get better just by taking charcoal, without any fungal biofilm destroyer?

Ive been on these forums for a while and alot of our experiences are very similar. But ok, im going to try that charcoal product. I have been taking itraconazole when it gets to the point im getting allergic to everything. I noticed the connection between the over growth and becomeing allergic to everything, my skin burns and i get hives. Yet when i kill off the fungus, my allergies to the food go away and i can eat them without issue. Im flaring up again after having to take antibiotics from surgery. I actually avoided them but got an infection so had no choice. I just knew what was going to happen to me once i did and i will be back to square one. 😫😖\n\nI want to add, the hangover feeling some of us get is because the yeasts ferments sugars in the gut turning it into alcohol and that is then turn in Acetaldehyde toxicity. NAC supplement helps with that, and after taking it the hangover feeling went away and i feel somewhat more normal and better, but i still am getting the burning skin randomly. So i still have to address it in my gut. \n\nIs this the product your referring to? \n\n[https://amzn.to/4jcZQS2](https://amzn.to/4jcZQS2)",

    "body": "Hi All,\n\nI am in my second year of medical school and have had SIBO-C since 2012. I thought I would paste the results of a small project here. As far as I can tell, ACTIVATED CHARCOAL is not being discussed, and I think it shows a lot of promise. It is also pretty affordable.\n\nMost research on activated charcoal shows efficacy in reducing gas. It adsorbs gas, and also adsorbs mean bacterial (E. coli, Kelbsiella, etc.). I have seen a couple papers showing that activated charcoal is even used as a supplement to animal feed to reduce bad intestinal species and promote growth.\n\nSo my thought is that Activated Charcoal helps SIBO (especially SIBO-C) in a twofold manner:\n\n1) reduces gas - thus reduces irritation, and emotional stress (which will slow motility). Methane by itself slows motility, so binding it up, I would think, would facilitate motility. Charcoal will bind hydrogen as well, all you SIBO-D folks.\n\n2) neutralizes bad guys - the bad guys that make the gas, the bad guys that make the toxins that further irritate your gut. Charcoal will also gladly bind to those toxins, too.\n\nCall my crazy, but I feel like this is the poor man's antibiotic. It has a strong historical precedent. I've been using it a couple days--a teaspoon in a big glass of water first thing in the morning, about 1 hour before eating. DO NOT COMBINE with food or medications, as charcoal is indiscriminate with what it binds. Use in moderation as a health tonic, not a life raft.\n\nI will continue to add this thread as I find more relevant articles. Encouraging others to post their papers as well.\n\n\\>>>>\n\n**“Can ingested activated charcoal be used to improve gastrointestinal motility in subjects with methanogenic small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO-C) compared to no intervention?”**\n\nThe level of evidence needed to answer this question could include Review Papers, Expert Opinions, Case Series & Case Reports, Clinical Trials, and Randomized Controlled Trials. The question is predicated on several known relationships between SIBO, hydrogen and methane gasses, methanogenic species, and constipation, but it is assumed that this question has not been thoroughly explored. A compelling case for a positive relationship could be a precedent for a double-blind RCT.\n\n**Search terms:**\n\n**“activated charcoal SIBO” (1 result)**\n\nMelchior C, Gourcerol G, Bridoux V, Ducrotté P, Quinton JF, Leroi AM.[ Efficacy of antibiotherapy for treating flatus incontinence associated with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: A pilot randomized trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28763464/) PLoS One. 2017 Aug 1;12(8):e0180835. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0180835.

        "body": "Awesome write up! Thanks for the great (and very well sourced) info, OP. \n\nOne thing I'd like to tack on is to advise people to only try this on a short-term basis unless they consult with a trusted healthcare professional about it who signs off (and stays updated) on longer-term use. From extremely brief investigation it looks like it is only classified as \"possibly safe\" for long term use, and I believe that is determined in more or less health populations which we are not. \n\nFor one thing, in longer term use it causes black stools, which if you happen to have intestinal bleeding at the same time for whatever reason this may cover that up. Maybe not super likely, but that could be potentially life threatening if you miss out on the critical signs of intestinal bleeding due to this otherwise benign side-effect.\n\nThere are a few other less common, but potentially quite serious issues with long term use such as intestinal blockage, dehydration, and regurgitating food into the lungs (yikes!). \n\nOh, and particularly for you methane folks, it appears longer term use also causes constipation. \n\nSo anyone looking to try this take OP's words to heart: *\"use in moderation* [and I would add, on a short term basis] *as a health tonic not a life raft.\"*\n\nCheers and thanks for taking us to school, OP! :)",

Moreover, the meso- and macropores of carbon seem to contribute little to bacterial adsorption by active carbons. The electron microscopy studies confirmed that the bacteria adhered mainly to the active carbon surface. Our results also indicate that the examined active carbons from beech (KB), coconut shells (TE50), and hard coal (RB2) do not adsorb (or adsorb with very limited efficiency) the vitamins that are routinely added to feed, such as A, B1, D, and K. Broilers fed with feed mixtures supplemented with activated carbon (KB) resulted in increases in the weight of the chickens \"",

Look up the keel score for chickens and compare.\n\nNow that you have had two young birds suffer in the heat, I'm almost certain you are having a similar problem to what I did last year, during our record summer in TX. My older girls who had been through summer before did well, but I had young cockerels and pullets suffering and some die. When I compared notes with a friend, we realized the young birds were in a feedback loop - they felt bad in the heat, so they stopped eating. They then grew weaker, so they couldn't eat or drink, and then eventually, after a few days of this, they passed. Otherwise, they acted fairly normally, but the survivors were very thin. I'm willing to bet you giving her a chance to cool down and eat/drink helped her turn around, but if you let her back out without additional precautions, she may be your first to pass next.\n\nWhat worked for us in subsequent hot days was providing a mash of feed and water (just a bowl in the run to encourage eating for the younger gals) and fresh water along with one waterer filled with poultry electrolytes mixed in. Then wetting the run (not misting the birds, as counterintuitively that can make them hotter) so that it evaporated and cooled their feet during the hottest part of the day. A regimen of this and my younger girls aren't even panting this week despite the temp rising over 100. Good luck!",

I actually thought it was pretty cool! So I bought it and immediately changed my vanilla toothbrush. \n\nJust a little background on my toothbrush habits: After watching something about **feacal** bacteria actually spreading throughout a bathroom (including the bristles of toothbrushes), I have religiously kept my toothbrush outside, in a tall cup beside the kitchen sink. I also wash my toothbrushes with soap before ever using them just to make sure. Now i'm not really a bacteriophobe, but the thought of FEACAL bacteria in my mouth just makes my skin crawl.\n\nI lived in a 2-bed, 1 bedroom apartment with my college buddy. For the most part, we didn't really mess with each others things, and did not really care for each others habits around the place (think college-messy). He had his own personal space outside the room and so did i, with the exception of some common areas (sink included). \n\nAnyway, i started to notice that everytime i pre-washed my toothbrush, some black stuff gets washed out. Stupid me assumed that it's some of the activated charcoal \"wearing out\" from the bristles and that it probably was going to turn grey or something eventually (it didn't). 2 weeks after having it was the first time in a while that me and my mate went into our morning preparations at the same time. He was holding his black leather shoes and made his way to the sink.  Saw me and stopped dead on his tracks, wide eyed as i brushed my teeth. \n\nHim: Why tf are you using that???\n\nMe: WDYM, this is my toothbrush\n\nHim: Isn't that a... shoe brush...?\n\nMe finally realizing what the black washed out stuff was: *Picachu face*\n\nTurned out, he had a different cup of discarded toothbrushes inside the cupboard below the sink, which he converted to shoe waxing and cleaning brushes (yeah, their bristles were black). He just absentmindedly assumed that the black one at the top of the sink was my shoe brush (i don't have any) and just used them out of convenience DAILY. \n\nNeedless to say, the brush went directly into the trash and i will never buy charcoal toothbrushes ever again. \n\nSo yeah, i pretty much shared my brush with my mate's shoe for around 2 weeks. At least i cleaned it before using and it made for a good funny story to tell.\n\nTLDR; Toothbrush *foot*brush",

Maybe it literally is that simple, though: separate the egg whites, freeze dry them, then heat them in a nitrogen atmosphere. I'm not certain Cody has all the equipment for that, but he might. (Applied Science might be another candidate channel? They've definitely done heating in a specific gas environment, which is a little bit technically demanding.)",

(A big issue with the Sawyer Squeeze and related products is that you can never let them freeze. If you suspect they hit the freezing point of water at any time after they've been put in service, you need to throw them away and buy a new one. I imaging aerogel would have the exact same issue.)",

Still, I wouldn't trust a homemade filter over a factory-made one in any cbrn cases, but for some mild stuff it might do. Just remember, that the longer charcoal is exposed even to seemingly clean air, the more it will expire, since it adsorbs all kinds of things lingering around, so you should aim to make the refilling as fast as possible, and store your filters in an airtight place",
